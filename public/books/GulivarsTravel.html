        <p>GULLIVER&rsquo;S TRAVELS</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>J o n at h a n S w i f t (1667&ndash;1745) was born in Dublin, where he was educated at Trinity College, and
            in 1713 became Dean of St Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral. While previously living in London, he had made friends
            with Pope, Gay, and Arbuthnot, formed with them the Scriblerus Club, and written propaganda for the Tory
            administra-tion of another club member, Robert Harley. He had first made his mark as a satirist with <em>A
                Tale of a Tub</em> and <em>The Battle of the Books</em> (1704), and after his return to Dublin (1714) he
            used his genius for polemical satire to defend Ireland (i.e. Anglo-Irish Protestants) against exploitation
            by the English Whigs, most sensationally in <em>A Modest Proposal</em> (1729). <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s
                Travels</em> is also a powerful polit-ical satire. Written when Swift was nearly 60, and first published
            in 1726, it at once became, quite literally, one of the world&rsquo;s classics.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>C lau d e R aw s o n is the Maynard Mack Professor of English at Yale University. He is author of a wide
            range of books, including <em>Henry Fielding and the Augustan Ideal under Stress</em> (1972), <em>Gulliver
                and the Gentle Reader</em> (1973), <em>Satire and Sentiment,</em><em>
                1660</em><em>&ndash;</em><em>1830</em><em>: Stress Points in the English Augustan Tradition</em> (1994,
            corrected paperback edition 2000), and, most recently, <em>God, Gulliver, and Genocide: Barbarism and the
                European Imagination,</em><em> 1492</em><em>&ndash;</em><em>1945</em> (Oxford University Press, 2001).
            Both he and Ian Higgins are Gen-eral Editors of the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Jonathan Swift.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I a n H i g g i n s is a Senior Lecturer in English Literature at the Australian National University. He
            works on British and Irish litera-ture, especially of the early eighteenth century. He is the author of
            <em>Swift&rsquo;s Politics: A Study in Disa</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>ection</em> (1994) and <em>Jonathan
                Swift</em>, Writers and their Work (2004), and of several articles on Swift and his contexts.</p>

        <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>J o n at h a n S w i f t (1667&ndash;1745) was born in Dublin. His English father died before he was born,
            and he was brought up by relatives in Dublin. He studied (not brilliantly) at Trinity College, Dublin, and
            was ordained as a priest of the (Anglican) Church of Ireland. In 1713, he became Dean of St Patrick&rsquo;s
            Cathedral in Dublin, an oﬃce he held for the rest of his life. He had always aspired to an English
            preferment, and hoped to become a bishop. He attributed his failure partly to the reputation for blasphemous
            unruliness of <em>A Tale of a Tub</em> (1704), his first major book and perhaps his most brilliant. He
            defended the <em>Tale</em> against charges of irreligion, but never openly acknowledged the work. This
            secretiveness over authorship ex-tended, in less extreme form, to many of his other works, including
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> (1726).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Though Irish by birth and education, Swift regarded his resi-dence in Ireland as a form of exile. In
            addition, after the death of Queen Anne in 1714, when Swift&rsquo;s political friends fell from power, Swift
            found himself in the political wilderness. After several years of pamphleteering for Robert Harley&rsquo;s
            Tory administration, he now largely ceased to write on English political subjects. Though resent-ful of his
            Irish exile, he became very active in Irish politics. From 1720 onwards, he produced a series of historic
            pamphlets on the political and economic wrongs of Ireland under English rule and on the ineptitude of the
            Irish at looking after their own interests. Through the <em>Drapier&rsquo;s Letters</em> (1724), <em>A
                Modest Proposal</em> (1729), and numerous other writings in verse and prose, he established himself as a
            &lsquo;Hibernian Patriot&rsquo;, and is honoured in the Irish Republic to this day as a founding hero of the
            modern nation. The Irish interest he defended against rule from London was that of the English settlers, not
            the &lsquo;natives&rsquo;, whom, in common with many English writers of his time, he largely despised. The
            Yahoos of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> are partly a portrait of these natives. But writing from the
            perspec-tive of the <em>colon</em> or settler, he nevertheless helped to inaugurate a tradition of
            resistance to metropolitan oppression which created the momentum for the eventual independence of an Irish
            Republic Swift might not have been altogether happy to see. <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p><em><br /> </em></p>
        <p>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Introduction</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(1726), his most famous work, is partly fuelled by his perspectives on the Irish situation (in the account of
            the Flying Island in Book III, for example, as well as the portrayal of the savage Yahoos in Book IV).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Swift&rsquo;s three decades of &lsquo;exile&rsquo; as Dean of St Patrick&rsquo;s were, until he was struck
            down by painful senile disorders near the end of his life, the most active of his career, both as one of the
            greatest Anglo-Irish political activists, and as an English writer. It is largely in these years that he
            established himself as not only one of the most brilliantly versatile and powerful satirists, but as a poet,
            journalist, and political commentator and activist of extraordinary range, eﬀectiveness, and distinction. He
            is nevertheless chiefly remembered for <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, which in abridged form became a
            famous children&rsquo;s book, and is also one of the bleakest satires of the human condition.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Composition and Publication</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> was written in the years 1721 to 1725, with Book</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>written last, and published in 1726 by the publisher Benjamin Motte. It was a great success, as
                Swift&rsquo;s friend John Gay reported, &lsquo;universally read, from the Cabinet-council to the
                Nursery&rsquo;, quickly entering the popular folklore,<sup>1</sup> with some of the impact of a modern
                soap opera in creating a make-believe world. It was written as a parody of travel books, a genre in
                which Swift was well read. He owned the great multi-volume travel compendia of Richard Hakluyt and
                Samuel Purchas, and wrote to his woman friend Vanessa (Esther Vanhomrigh) in 1722 that he had been
                reading &lsquo;I know not how many diverting Books of History and Travells&rsquo;, adding to a male
                friend a few days later that they were an &lsquo;abundance of Trash&rsquo;.<sup>2</sup></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The travel-book background forms the outward armature of a deep satirical exploration of the human creature.
            Behind it lies a lifetime of reading in the works of classical and Renaissance ethnographers, from Herodotus
            and Pliny to Montaigne, and a live interest in the culture, society, and politics of humans in history and
            in his own time. <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> belongs to a species of parody which is not mainly
            concerned with the books it is ostensibly</p>

        <p>mimicking, but uses the medium of parody to explore matters of more central and substantial human import. It
            purports to be a philosophical response to definitions of man as a &lsquo;rational animal&rsquo;. It flirted
            with dangerous political allusions, as well as with other shocks to polite sensibilities, and Swift claimed
            that the publisher Motte had expurgated and sanitized his text. Some corrections were made by Motte in a
            &lsquo;Second Edition&rsquo; in 1727, but when the work was included in 1735 as volume iii of the edition of
            Swift&rsquo;s <em>Works</em> by the Dublin publisher George Faulkner, it included further revisions, some of
            them not intended in 1726. There was some mystification over Swift&rsquo;s role in the 1735 edition, from
            which Swift also pre-tended to keep his distance, though his involvement in it seems to have been
            considerable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Gulliver and Swift,</em><em> 1726</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The book we know as <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> first appeared on 28 October 1726 as <em>Travels into

            g e o n, and then a C a p ta i n of several S h i p s&rsquo;. There was no overt sign of Swift&rsquo;s
            authorship. The title of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, by which the book is nowadays universally known,
            is a popular piece of shorthand, with no formal authority, though Swift was referring coyly to &lsquo;a Book
            . . .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>called Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels&rsquo; as early as 17 November 1726.<sup>3</sup> The fron-tispiece was a
            lifelike medallion portrait of &lsquo;<em>Captain Lemuel Gulliver, of</em> Redriﬀ &AElig;tat. suae 58&rsquo;
            (i.e. at the age of 58), a hitherto unusual, possibly unprecedented, feature in an imaginary voyage,
            ostensibly signalling a true account.<sup>4</sup> To a few friends, it was probably evident that the age was
            also that of Jonathan Swift, whose authorship was not disclosed, and an eagle-eyed reader would be able to
            report from the text that this cannot have been Gulliver&rsquo;s real age.<sup>5</sup> Some readers may have

            <em>Introduction</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>not unlike that of Swift himself&rsquo;.<sup>6</sup> To the average reader of the book, the portrait held no
            secret code. To the knowing reader, the code would not yield all its secrets, for Gulliver is not Swift,
            although Swift is a lurking presence behind him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This elusive interchange of identities extended in the opposite direction, to portraits of Swift himself.
            When, after 1726, the Irish painter Francis Bindon painted what is sometimes thought to be the first of his
            series of portraits of Swift, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, the likeness seemed to show a
            consciousness of the frontispiece Gulliver. The painter is in any case concerned with the book. The portrait
            shows Swift pointing to the title-page of Book IV, &lsquo;A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms&rsquo;,
            on a scroll in his hand. In the background is a peaceful Irish landscape, with Houyhnhnm-evoking
            horses.<sup>7</sup> Both this and the portrait itself thus maintain pictorially a traﬃc between the
            fictional Gulliver and Swift himself which conforms closely with the character and early history of the book
            itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the early editions, this traﬃc is part of a flaunted mystification, which suggests more than the
            instinctive secrecy about authorship evident in most of Swift&rsquo;s major works, the product of
            convention, temperamental guardedness, and the risk of political trouble attend-ant on subversive writings.
            There is in addition, throughout the narrative, a protracted tease about the truth content of the work we
            are reading, and about the character and extent of the &lsquo;real&rsquo; author&rsquo;s commitment to it
            (whoever he might be). This ostensibly authentic portrait of a mariner-author is followed in the first
            edition by a foreword from &lsquo;The Publisher [i.e. Editor] to the Reader&rsquo;, signed by
            Gulliver&rsquo;s cousin Richard Sympson. Some of this will not be entirely comprehensible until we have read
            through the whole work. But it is possible for the reader to remain comfortable (as he or she will not be
            for long) that nothing more is in the oﬃng than a real travel narra-tive, or a fiction pretending to be one,
            like Defoe&rsquo;s <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> (1719), a work Swift may have found easier to parody than to
            admit</p>

        <p>to having read. In an earlier work, Swift had referred to Defoe, a lifelong antagonist, as &lsquo;the Fellow
            that was <em>pilloryed</em>, I have forgot his Name&rsquo;, subsequently identifying him (in 1735) in a
            footnote without removing the pretence of having forgotten him.<sup>8</sup> But in these open-ing moves of
            the first edition, the first-time reader has little obvious incentive to detect mystifications and covert
            agendas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;The Publisher to the Reader&rsquo; is followed, after the Table of Con-tents (not reproduced in this
            edition), by the famous opening of Gulliver&rsquo;s own autobiographical narrative:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Father had a small Estate in <em>Nottinghamshire</em>; I was the Third of five Sons. He sent me to
            <em>Emanuel-College</em> in <em>Cambridge</em>, at Fourteen Years old, where I resided three Years, and
            applied myself close to my Studies: But the Charge of maintaining me (although I had a very scanty
            Allowance) being too great for a narrow Fortune; I was bound Apprentice to Mr <em>James Bates</em>, an
            eminent Surgeon in <em>London</em>, with whom I continued four Years; and my Father now and then sending me
            small Sums of Money, I laid them out in learning Navigation, and other Parts of the Mathematicks, useful to
            those who intend to travel, as I always believed it would be some time or other my Fortune to do. When I
            left Mr <em>Bates</em>, I went down to my Father; where, by the Assistance of him and my Uncle
            <em>John</em>, and some other Relations, I got Forty Pounds, and a Promise of Thirty Pounds a Year to
            maintain me at <em>Leyden</em>: There I studied Physick two Years and seven Months, knowing it would be
            useful in long Voyages. (i. i)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This plain, matter-of-fact narrative, immediately following the frontispiece and foreword, is said to have
            deceived some readers into believing they were being oﬀered a true story. One sea captain claimed to be
            &lsquo;very well acquainted with Gulliver, but that the printer had mistaken, that he livd in Wapping, &amp;
            not at Rotherhith [i.e. the Redriﬀ of the portrait and foreword]&rsquo;. An old gentleman searched for
            Lilliput on his map. Best of all, an Irish bishop report-edly preened himself on not being taken in, having
            been taken in to the extent that he thought he was meant to be taken in. He proudly declared that he thought
            the &lsquo;book was full of improbable lies, and for his part, he hardly believed a word of it&rsquo;. His

            <em>Introduction</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>matched by the triumphalism of Swift and his friends over his addlement.<sup>9</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Swift was a consummate hoaxer. He wrote a parody of the astrol-oger Partridge in 1708, predicting the
            latter&rsquo;s death, and announcing the event on the due date, to the victim&rsquo;s discomfiture. On
            another occasion, in 1722, he published some &lsquo;last words&rsquo; of a dead criminal, suggesting that
            the latter had left behind the names and addresses of all his criminal brethren, thus purportedly reducing
            the number of street robberies.<sup>10</sup> Such eﬀects of persuading the readers that they are witnessing
            reality rather than just reading a story came to be valued, by Richardson as by Flaubert, as one of the
            great achievements of the novel form, and, in our time, connect the novel with soap operas. The readers who
            begged Richardson or Dickens to spare Clarissa or Paul Dombey look ahead to audiences of <em>General
                Hospital</em> or <em>Coron-ation Street</em>. The compelling intimacy of this &lsquo;illusion of
            life&rsquo; was, in Swift&rsquo;s lifetime, a cherished objective of Richardson, and perhaps of Defoe,
            &lsquo;the Fellow that was <em>pilloryed</em>&rsquo; for writing <em>The Shortest-Way with the
                Dissenters</em> (1702), a mock extermination proposal which was taken straight, thus variously
            disturbing the peace; and who later became a founding father of the realist novel.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To Swift, as to his other contemporaries Pope or Fielding (himself a novelist of a diﬀerent stripe),
            conditioned by classical or Augustan standards of impersonal seriousness and gentlemanly codes of
            &lsquo;conversational&rsquo; decorum, such things seemed an in-your-face vul-garity. What would do for an
            ephemeral <em>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</em> was not suitable for writings of more ambitious purpose. Even a
            first-time reader of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, once inside the Gulliverian world of big men and
            little men, flying islands, and talking horses, might be expected to understand that he or she was reading
            neither a true story nor a realistic narrative. If they did not, the whole of the work&rsquo;s satirical
            content would misfire. The sea captain, the old gentleman, the Irish bishop were all very well as gratifying
            oddities, a tribute to the satirist&rsquo;s power to make fools of obtuse know-alls. But if everyone reacted
            in this way, the whole point of the book would be lost, as it was lost for those taken in by Defoe&rsquo;s
            <em>Shortest-Way</em>, with nasty consequences for the author to boot.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The veristic trimmings of the front matter and opening para-graphs of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, even
            for first-time readers of the first edition, ultimately exist in relation to elements in the book which are
            designedly so fantastic as to defy any suspension of disbelief. The deceptive opening partly serves as a
            guard-lowering ruse, an impres-sion of truth and sympathetic ordinariness, softening the reader into
            complacency before assaulting him with a bewildering blend of unassimilable fantasy and harshly disturbing
            revelations about the human creature. This unresolved tension, between an undemand-ingly genial mode of
            writing and subsequent assaults on the reader&rsquo;s expectations and poise, is a characteristic signature
            of Swift&rsquo;s satiric manner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is evident that Swift had a highly developed sense of the extra-textual resources of front matter. He went
            on tinkering with the frontispiece portrait in the subsequent publication history of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s
                Travels</em>, until it reached, in 1735, the revised version in which it is most commonly read today
            (including the present edition). In a later issue of the first edition, a second state of the portrait added
            a Latin quotation from the ending of the second satire of the Roman poet Persius, protesting the
            writer&rsquo;s (i.e. Gulliver&rsquo;s) purity of mind, and &lsquo;heart steeped in nobility and
            honour&rsquo; (l. 74). If the reader is seduced by this into thinking of Gulliver as a truthful or reliable
            reporter, there will be much in the rest of the work to disabuse or complicate this impression. The eﬀect of
            tease and uncertainty induced by this is something Swift developed and exploited in later appearances of the
            portrait, and in other pieces of front matter.<sup>11</sup></p>

        <p><em>Gulliver, his Cousin Sympson, and Swift,</em><em> 1735</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Swift believed, and made a performance of believing, that the pub-lisher had tampered with his text. He
            compiled a list of changes, some of which were added in 1727, and most of which eventually found their way
            into the &lsquo;final&rsquo; version. This formed volume iii of a collected <em>Works</em> published in 1735
            by the Dublin bookseller George Faulkner (in four volumes, subsequently expanded over the years).</p>

            <em>Introduction</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although the original holograph manuscript of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> no longer survives, the
            evidence suggests that the later edition is to a greater or lesser extent a revised version rather than a
            restored original.<sup>12</sup> Swift sometimes pretended that this edition also &lsquo;was done utterly
            against my will&rsquo; (to Pulteney, 8 March 1735). Faulkner, on the other hand, says Swift worked daily
            with his publisher and &lsquo;corrected every Sheet of the first seven Volumes that were published in his
            Life Time&rsquo;.<sup>13</sup> Swift&rsquo;s account is true to character and Faulk-ner&rsquo;s appears
            closer to the facts.<sup>14</sup> Indeed the likelihood is that Swift had a hand in preparing
            Faulkner&rsquo;s prefatory pieces to the volumes of 1735, if these were &lsquo;not actually written by
            him&rsquo;.<sup>15</sup> Similarly, it is more than likely that Swift was also involved in at least some
            aspects of the production process, especially those concerning the portraits. Here again, the title-page
            announces the author as Lemuel Gulliver, although now that the work is included in a collected edition of
            Swift&rsquo;s work, Swift&rsquo;s initials are on the same title-page, and secrecy of authorship gives way
            to a more overt tease as to the elusive relation-ship between the narrator and the real-life author, by no
            means identical but linked by elusive overlappings and ambiguous distan-cings.<sup>16</sup> The portrait has
            changed. Or rather there are two new versions of the portrait, depending on whether the volume belongs to
            the octavo format of <em>Works</em>, 1735, or the smaller duodecimo set.<sup>17</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This time, a resemblance to portraits of Swift becomes overtly paraded. It has been pointed out that
            &lsquo;the oval which frames the portrait is a shape common to both portraits and
            mirrors&rsquo;,<sup>18</sup> a fact</p>

        <p>which may be apt to the game of identities between narrator and author. Of the two versions of the Faulkner
            edition, the octavo espe-cially bears a striking likeness to the portrait of Swift himself which serves as
            frontispiece to volume i of the same Faulkner edition, and which is an engraving based on a portrait by the
            Irish painter Charles Jervas, who painted Swift in 1709, and 1716&ndash;17 or 1718, and super-vised
            engravings, and was also a friend and portraitist of Pope.<sup>19</sup> Unlike Pope, who sat for many
            painters throughout his life,<sup>20</sup> Swift did not like being painted, and was sometimes curmudgeonly
            about it. &lsquo;I hate to be in Town while [Jervas] is there&rsquo;, he wrote in a letter of 4 October
            1716. Many years later, close to the time of Faulkner&rsquo;s edition, he speaks of having been &lsquo;fool
            enough to sit for my Picture at full length by Mr Bindon&rsquo; (15&ndash;16 June 1735). Bindon&rsquo;s work
            was itself &lsquo;very much derived from Jervas&rsquo;s initial eﬀort but with some adjustments for the
            advancement of age&rsquo;.<sup>21</sup> An atmosphere of irritability surrounds Swift&rsquo;s relations to
            portraits of himself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An observant reader would be exercised by the resemblance between the portraits in volumes i and iii, and, to
            the extent that he or she remembers it, would be actively unsettled by the uncertainties of focus and
            wavelength which it contributes to a text already heavily impregnated with elusively aggressive obliquities.
            In addition, in both versions of the 1735 Gulliver frontispiece a small new time bomb has been lobbed at the
            reader. Gulliver&rsquo;s age and place of residence, and the quotation from Persius, are dropped. Instead,
            in both versions, the caption now merely says &lsquo;Capt. Lemuel Gulliver Splendide Mendax. Hor.&rsquo; The
            Latin phrase comes from Horace&rsquo;s <em>Odes</em>, i i i. xi. 35, and refers to Hypermestra, the only one
            of fifty</p>

        <p>daughters of Danaus who disobeyed her father in order to save her husband. It is an inversion of the use of
            Persius in the earlier edition, aﬃrming Gulliver&rsquo;s honour and purity of mind. It means &lsquo;lying
            magnificently&rsquo;, in a good cause, but still lying. Attached prominently to the frontispiece portrait of
            the narrator, it implies both unreliability and some sort of nobility of purpose.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most disconcerting piece of front-matter in the 1735 edition is the cantankerous letter from
            Gulliver to his Cousin Sympson, dated &lsquo;<em>April</em> 2, 1727&rsquo;. In it, Gulliver begins by
            complain-ing that the first edition of his book was marred by deletions and additions attributed to
            Sympson&rsquo;s fear &lsquo;of giving Oﬀence&rsquo; to &lsquo;People in Power&rsquo;, as well as by some
            unacceptable stylistic usages. Gulliver&rsquo;s &lsquo;comic dismay&rsquo; is in many ways a replay of that
            of Swift himself, so much so that Michael Treadwell, one of the best students of the textual history, speaks
            of this as &lsquo;Gulliver/Swift&rsquo; writing to &lsquo;Sympson/Motte&rsquo; (i.e. Benjamin Motte, the
            publisher of the first edition). As always, Gulliver both is and is not Swift, and Swift&rsquo;s complaints
            about the corruptions of the first edition may have been to some extent &lsquo;facetious&rsquo; or
            exaggerated in the manner of the letter to Sympson, partly in order to deflect &lsquo;onto the poor printers
            criticism for carelessness which was his own and which he could not otherwise correct&rsquo;, and partly out
            of mischievous jokerie.<sup>22</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gulliver explains that he never wanted to publish his book but gave in to pressure from his cousin; that he
            never expected the book to have any eﬀect since &lsquo;the <em>Yahoos</em> were a Species of Animals utterly
            incapable of Amendment&rsquo;; and yet that &lsquo;instead of seeing a full Stop put to all Abuses and
            Corruptions, . . . as I had Reason to expect: Behold, after above six Months Warning, I cannot learn that my
            Book hath produced one single Eﬀect according to mine Inten-tions&rsquo;. In other words, although he
            expected no change, he is angry at the absence of changes he &lsquo;had Reason to expect&rsquo;. As a
            result, he is dismayed to find that six months after publication humanity is still unreformed (the date of 2
            April 1727, appended to a letter first published in 1735, happens to be just over five, or very roughly six,
            months after the original publication of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> on 28 October 1726, as only a
            very knowing reader would know, though</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gulliver compounds confusion by sliding from &lsquo;above six Months Warning&rsquo; to a remark about
            &lsquo;seven Months&rsquo; being a &lsquo;suﬃcient Time&rsquo;):</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Behold, after above six Months Warning, I cannot learn that my Book hath produced one single Eﬀect according
            to mine Intentions: I desired you would let me know by a Letter, when Party and Faction were extin-guished;
            Judges learned and upright; Pleaders honest and modest, with some Tincture of common Sense; and
            <em>Smith</em><em>fi</em><em>eld</em> blazing with Pyramids of Law-Books; the young Nobility&rsquo;s
            Education entirely changed; the Physicians banished; the female <em>Yahoos</em> abounding in Virtue, Honour,
            Truth and good Sense: Courts and Levees of great Ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; Wit, Merit and
            Learning rewarded; all Disgracers of the Press in Prose and Verse, condemned to eat nothing but their own
            Cotten, and quench their Thirst with their own Ink. These, and a Thousand other Reformations, I firmly
            counted upon by your Encouragement; as indeed they were plainly deducible from the Precepts delivered in my
            Book. And, it must be owned, that seven Months were a suﬃcient Time to correct every Vice and Folly to which
            <em>Yahoos</em> are sub-ject; if their Natures had been capable of the least Disposition to Virtue or
            Wisdom: Yet so far have you been from answering mine Expectation in any of your Letters; that on the
            contrary, you are loading our Carrier every Week with Libels, and Keys, and Reflections, and Memoirs, and
            Second Parts; wherein I see myself accused of reflecting upon great States-Folk; of degrading human Nature,
            (for so they have still the Confidence to stile it) and of abusing the Female Sex. I find likewise, that the
            Writers of those Bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not allow me to be Author of
            mine own Travels; and others make me Author of Books to which I am wholly a Stranger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The last sentence is one more salvo in the aggressive mystification over authorship, by now largely disposed
            of by the inclusion of the work in an edition of Swift&rsquo;s <em>Works</em>, but still allowed to crackle
            uncomfortably, and suﬃcient to sustain a reader&rsquo;s chronic uncertainty as to the relationship and exact
            roles of Gulliver and the satirist behind him. The language of Gulliver to Sympson bears a dis-concerting
            resemblance both to Swift&rsquo;s own complaints that the first edition of his book had been subjected to
            deletions, and insertions of &lsquo;trash contrary to the Author&rsquo;s manner and Style, and
            Intention&rsquo; (to Charles Ford, 9 October 1733); and also to Swift&rsquo;s early disclaimer of
            involvement in the revised edition of 1735, &lsquo;an evil I cannot prevent&rsquo; (to Pope, 8 July 1733),
            and which he hasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;looked into . . . nor I</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>believe ever shall&rsquo; (to Pulteney, 8 March 1735).<sup>23</sup> You cannot take Swift straight on any
            such issue, but he doesn&rsquo;t always mean the opposite either.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The traﬃc between the fictional text and real life is variously carried out in Swift&rsquo;s correspondence,
            from mixed motives of con-cealment and play. In Swift&rsquo;s correspondence with his friends, there is the
            same combination of flaunting and concealment, a continu-ously nudging and winking <em>diablerie</em> as to
            the Gulliver connection. Letters are signed, by Swift and his friends, with Gulliverian names. One letter,
            to Mrs Howard (28 November 1726), is signed &lsquo;Lemuel Gulliver&rsquo;. Another, from Mrs Howard, was
            signed &lsquo;Sieve [the term is Lilliputian for a court lady] Yahoo&rsquo;, which Swift made a fussy
            pre-tence of not understanding (10, 17 November 1726). Swift also wrote to Pope the same day (17 November)
            about &lsquo;a Letter of Mrs Howard&rsquo;s, writ in such mystical terms, that I should never have found out
            the meaning, if a Book had not been sent me called Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels&rsquo;, adding &lsquo;that if I
            were Gulliver&rsquo;s friend, I would desire all my acquaintance to give out that his copy was basely
            man-gled, and abused, and added to, and blotted out by the printer&rsquo;.<sup>24</sup> He also
            corresponded, directly or by proxy, with the publisher Motte, using the name &lsquo;Richard Sympson&rsquo;
            (8, 11, 13 August 1726, 27 April 1727),<sup>25</sup> although Sympson partially stands for Motte himself in
            the book, and sometimes using John Gay&rsquo;s handwriting as a cover.<sup>26</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If Swift often writes in Gulliver-mode, it is not surprising that Gulliver should sometimes write like Swift.
            Few early readers, and only the most determined readers today, would have, or choose to acquire, suﬃcient
            access to Swift&rsquo;s own correspondence to recognize its resemblance to Gulliver&rsquo;s cantankerous
            protestations, but the resemblance reinforces or confirms intimations in the work itself that Gulliver, like
            others of Swift&rsquo;s derided speakers, is related to, or resembles, his creator. There is a long history
            of complaints by Swift</p>

        <p>about the corruptions in the text of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> of which the Letter to Sympson
            provides a grotesque Gulliverian parody.<sup>27</sup> But even without this doubtless unintended
            recognition, the letter to Sympson is a powerful low-key weapon in Swift&rsquo;s wearing down of his
            reader&rsquo;s composure. The rest of the passage has a similar eﬀect. The reader will recognize a familiar
            rhetoric of satire, showing the satirist deranged by the disappointment of rational expectations about
            humanity&rsquo;s behaviour. The disjunction between ideal and real-istic expectation is a staple of satire.
            In practice it suggests that the speaker is understood by both author and reader to be antisocial or even
            neurotic, but that he is right by a higher standard, and would not have become unhinged if the world had
            been a decent place. The reader seems to be oﬀered the luxury of discounting a character who (as in
            Gulliver&rsquo;s case) is driven to excesses of eccentric misanthropy, and who prefers to spend his time
            with the horses in his stable rather than with his wife and family. Such discounting, however, cannot extend
            to the balance sheet of human depravity which the entire fiction has drawn up, and which Gulliver summarizes
            in this passage, an indictment which is evidently a principal moral lesson of the fiction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How much, and what, to discount is what remains uncertain, a tease which undermines readerly comfort, and
            enables the satirist to make his point without being dismissed as excessive or insane, like his speaker. And
            Gulliver himself speaks for his author when he expresses lack of interest in the reader&rsquo;s good opinion
            of his person: &lsquo;I wrote for their Amendment, and not their Approbation&rsquo;. The words prefigure
            Gulliver&rsquo;s remarks to the reader in the final chapter: &lsquo;My principal Design was to inform, and
            not to amuse thee&rsquo; (i v. xii). The testy unfriendliness of this is consonant with Swift&rsquo;s
            declaration to Pope on 29 September 1725, as he was finishing writing <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>,
            that &lsquo;the chief end I propose to my self . . . is to vex the world rather then divert
            it&rsquo;.<sup>28</sup> Whichever words were written first,<sup>29</sup> it is hard to think of them as
            other than variations on one another, a further sign of intimate traﬃc between Swift and Gulliver, and of

            <em>Introduction</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the atmosphere Swift was determined to create between his book and his reader.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first-time reader of the letter to Sympson does not yet know fully why Gulliver likes to be in a stable,
            but Gulliver&rsquo;s preference for the neighing of his horses to the conversation of his family and
            neighbours is a hint of disconcerting priorities, to be explained as the narrative reaches its final stages.
            Indeed, the entire quarrelsome discourse is not easy for a first-time reader to assimilate. It is the
            language of the later disenchanted Gulliver of Book IV, not that of the innocuously bland narrator whom we
            are about to meet in the opening chapter of Book I. To understand it fully, one needs to have read the whole
            book at least once before, like some modern fictions by Conrad, Ford, or William Faulkner, whose time scheme
            is dislocated in the service of a non-chronological understanding of the events. But this is not, in
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, a matter of manipulating narrative expectation or the presentation of
            character, but of inducing unease as a tactic of satirical attrition. The simpler satirical eﬀect, of first
            oﬀering a na&iuml;ve and guileless narrator ripe for shocks of undeception, gives way to a mood of more
            con-tinuous undefined foreboding, hard to reconcile with the ensuing accounts of the gullible Gulliver in
            Book I. The unspecific unease of Gulliver&rsquo;s chatter acquires increasing validation as the evidence of
            human depravity mounts, and only defines itself fully as an expression of Gulliver&rsquo;s acrimonious
            &lsquo;character&rsquo; at the end.<sup>30</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> is not a novel like those of Conrad, Ford, or Faulkner, of course. But nor
            is it much like the fictions of its own time, by Defoe, Richardson, or even Fielding, which we agree to call
            novels. Swift, as I have suggested, would not have been a willing practitioner of the realism or narrative
            immediacy of Defoe or Richardson. The lifelike unfolding of a personal story is not his purpose. Such
            realism of notation as he displays is largely a parody of travel books or possibly of travel fictions, and
            exists in the service of satirical exposure rather than the building of fictional &lsquo;illusion&rsquo;.
            Though Gulliver has a wife, family, home address, and elements of a biographical record, he does not come
            over as a fully</p>

        <p>human personality. His progression from acquiescent lover of his kind to alienated misanthrope is more a
            satirical awakening to truth than a significant process of psychological change. Although he is never the
            equivalent of Swift, he is always the instrument of what Swift shows or says through him. It is usually more
            natural in the reading, and certainly more productive, to attend to a Swiftian agenda than to any sort of
            expression of Gulliverian per-sonality in anything Gulliver says. The shifts and inconsistencies of
            Gulliver&rsquo;s point of view are more properly understood as modula-tions of Swiftian irony than as mental
            gyrations of the character himself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Savages and Imperial Conquest</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most remarkable example of such &lsquo;inconsistency&rsquo; occurs in Gulliver&rsquo;s anti-imperial
            outburst at the end of the book, a passage of great power and interest in its own right. Gulliver has just
            been telling the reader that he has decided not to honour his obligation &lsquo;as a Subject of
            <em>England</em>&rsquo; to report to the government the countries he has visited, since &lsquo;whatever
            Lands are discovered by a Subject, belong to the Crown&rsquo;:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To say the Truth, I had conceived a few Scruples with relation to the distributive Justice of Princes upon
            those Occasions. For Instance, A Crew of Pyrates are driven by a Storm they know not whither; at length a
            Boy discovers Land from the Top-mast; they go on Shore to rob and plunder; they see an harmless People, are
            entertained with Kindness, they give the Country a new Name, they take formal Possession of it for the King,
            they set up a rotten Plank or a Stone for a Memorial, they murder two or three Dozen of the Natives, bring
            away a Couple more by Force for a Sample, return home, and get their Pardon. Here commences a new Dominion
            acquired with a Title by <em>Divine Right</em>. Ships are sent with the first Opportunity; the Natives
            driven out or destroyed, their Princes tortured to discover their Gold; a free Licence given to all Acts of
            Inhumanity and Lust; the Earth reeking with the Blood of its Inhabitants: And this execrable Crew of
            Butchers employed in so pious an Expedition, is a <em>modern Colony</em> sent to convert and civilize an
            idolatrous and barbarous People. (i v. xii)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The passage is one of the great denunciations of imperial conquest, ranking with those of Las Casas and
            Montaigne, and probably</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>xxiv&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Introduction</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>inspired by the latter.<sup>31</sup> Its eloquent indignation is a set-piece of Swiftian prose, one of the
            rare occasions when Swift allowed himself such accents of lofty fervour, his normal habit being expressed by
            the assertion that &lsquo;I the lofty Stile decline&rsquo;.<sup>32</sup> Its vibrant rhetoric is also, <em>a
                fortiori</em>, outside Gulliver&rsquo;s range as a stylist. But the anger it expresses confirms what we
            know of Gulliver&rsquo;s own feelings at this time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the immediately following paragraph, however, Gulliver goes on to say:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But this Description, I confess, doth by no means aﬀect the <em>British</em> Nation, who may be an Example to
            the whole World for their Wisdom, Care, and Justice in planting Colonies; their liberal Endowments for the
            Advancement of Religion and Learning; their Choice of devout and able Pastors to propagate
            <em>Christianity</em>; their Caution in stocking their Prov-inces with People of sober Lives and
            Conversations from this the Mother Kingdom; their strict Regard to the Distribution of Justice, in supplying
            the Civil Administration through all their Colonies with Oﬃcers of the greatest Abilities, utter Strangers
            to Corruption: And to crown all, by sending the most vigilant and virtuous Governors, who have no other
            Views than the Happiness of the People over whom they preside, and the Honour of the King their Master.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This cannot be the same Gulliver, unless he is being stingingly ironic. But conscious and stinging ironies
            are as much outside Gulliver&rsquo;s stylistic range as the eloquent righteousness of the preced-ing
            passage. If we read either passage as mainly expressive of Gulliver&rsquo;s character, we are confronted by
            a shocking and implaus-ible inconsistency, in itself almost amounting to cheeky defiance on the
            author&rsquo;s part. That option contains its own readerly discomforts. But it seems more natural to read
            both passages as ultimately eman-ating from a Swiftian rather than Gulliverian voice, the first express-ing
            indignation literally, the second doing so ironically, with an added sarcasm at the species of British
            complacency frequently</p>

        <p>expressed by travel writers and imperial adventurers before and since.<sup>33</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The latter sarcasm is par for the course, characteristic of Swift&rsquo;s resourcefully incriminating style.
            If taken straight, it is a return to Gulliver&rsquo;s much earlier manner of complacent acceptance of his
            country and all its ways. The fact not only evokes the awkwardness of regarding Gulliver as a significant
            personality in his own right. Since the earlier Gulliver no longer exists, Swift&rsquo;s brief resurrection
            of him may even be seen as a playful undermining of his own fictional trimmings. That it is Swift&rsquo;s
            own voice behind his speaker which dominates a reading of both paragraphs, straight and ironic, seems
            inescapable on any reading.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is this which makes the fullest sense of the sarcasm of &lsquo;British is best&rsquo;, and gives life to
            other features of both passages. In an equal and opposite way the account of the oppression of harmless
            natives is not what it seems. The reader comes upon it after a prolonged exposure, in the rest of the book,
            to the unremitting depravity of humans in all the &lsquo;Remote Nations&rsquo; visited by Gulliver,
            culminating in the humanoid Yahoos, expressly identified with &lsquo;all savage Nations&rsquo; (i v. ii),
            and the all too human natives of New Holland who shot Gulliver with an arrow, which Gulliver feared might be
            poisoned, on his departure from Houyhnhnmland (i v. xi). What is said about the &lsquo;harmless
            People&rsquo; in Gulliver&rsquo;s speech is spoken with passion, and there is no reason to suppose that
            Swift didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;mean&rsquo; it. But he meant it in a way that is coloured by an opposite and
            compet-ing perception, which the volume has been sustaining forcefully throughout.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Even in the speech itself, the &lsquo;harmless People&rsquo; are seen as passive recipients of the cruelty of
            others rather than as actively virtuous. When it is suggested that they treat their oppressors kindly, the
            syntax emphasizes that the oppressors &lsquo;are entertained with Kindness&rsquo;, so that the only specific
            record of good action is pre-sented in the passive mode, in the process of being received rather than given.
            All the active verbs belong to the invading evil-doers. The &lsquo;harmless People&rsquo; exist more to
            bring out the depravity of these evil-doers than their own virtue or suﬀering as victims.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Swift detested oppressors. They were an extreme example of a</p>

            <em>Introduction</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>human depravity Swift saw as potential in all humans. The oppressed by definition included:
            &lsquo;savages&rsquo;, the Irish, women, to all of whom Swift directed some of his most stinging contempt.
            Accusations of &lsquo;racism&rsquo; or misogyny are beside the point, not because they are often
            anachronistic, but because Swift&rsquo;s way with despised subgroups is to say that they are merely human,
            and that dominant or favoured groups are in fact just as bad. Swift was con-scious of being open to charges
            of misanthropy and misogyny. Gulliver&rsquo;s Letter to Sympson complains of being &lsquo;accused . . . of
            degrading human Nature, (for so they have still the Confidence to stile it) and of abusing the Female
            Sex&rsquo;. It is a notable feature of his most memorable disparagements, or apparent disparagements, of the
            female form divine (the flayed woman of <em>A Tale of a Tub</em>, the Brobdingnagian ladies of
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>), that they are immedi-ately followed by a male counter-example. Again,
            this is not to deny aggressive sentiments, and the counter-examples may have a defen-sive or compensatory
            element. But they also belong to a persistent eﬀort of reorientation, away from the specific category to the
            human species itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is especially true of the xenophobic, or what we would call &lsquo;racist&rsquo;, aspects of
            Swift&rsquo;s satire. <em>A Modest Proposal</em> is an ironic vari-ation on the old idea that the native
            Irish were cannibals. But the cannibal slur often directed at the natives is redirected at, or at least
            extended to, the Anglo-Irish ruling group to which Swift belonged, and also to the ogre nation England,
            willing to devour Ireland with-out salt. In the fourth book of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, what
            begins as a portrait of humanoid Yahoos who resemble &lsquo;all savage Nations&rsquo;, ends up as an anatomy
            of the entire human race. The language of racial insult is used to attack the species as a whole, much as
            Augustan satirists used lordly language to attack malefactors, including lords, as low. Humankind is
            represented as &lsquo;low-race&rsquo; in the way satirized malefactors are made to appear
            &lsquo;low-class&rsquo;. Arguably, &lsquo;racists&rsquo; are likelier to use the language of misanthropy
            against specific groups than to allow ethnic slurs to spread to all humans, including themselves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is not to sentimentalize Swift&rsquo;s account of &lsquo;savages&rsquo;, only to place it in a wider,
            bleaker, but ultimately less ungenerous perspec-tive. By the time we reach the final chapter, relations
            between narra-tor and reader have deteriorated. Gulliver&rsquo;s distaste for humanity is</p>

        <p><em>Introduction</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>accompanied by an exacerbated quarrelsomeness, very diﬀerent from the ostensibly guileless geniality of the
            earliest parts of the work, a quarrelsomeness evident in the letter to Sympson, which was added to the
            opening pages in 1735. The final chapter opens with an address to the &lsquo;gentle Reader&rsquo;:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thus, gentle Reader, I have given thee a faithful History of my Travels for Sixteen Years, and above Seven
            Months; wherein I have not been so studious of Ornament as of Truth. I could perhaps like others have
            aston-ished thee with strange improbable Tales; but I rather chose to relate plain Matter of Fact in the
            simplest Manner and Style; because my principal Design was to inform, and not to amuse thee. (i v. xii)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The &lsquo;familiar&rsquo; form of the second person singular (thee) is here aggressive, addressed to an
            inferior, as though familiarity had bred contempt. &lsquo;Informing&rsquo; the reader is, as we saw, the
            flipside of &lsquo;vexing&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;diverting&rsquo; him. The protestation of strict
            fac-tual truth is a parody of tall travellers&rsquo; tales. But coming after a flying island, a visit to the
            ancient dead, and a land of speaking horses, it strikes a disconcerting note, especially when the
            extravagant fan-tasies are recognized as in fact enforcing moral truths about humans, which are hard, on the
            evidence given, to deny. The crackling aggressiveness towards the reader may be detected in
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> from the beginning, but its forms are more benign, and more playful, in
            the earlier books.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Downward Cycles of Human History</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The gradual unfolding of human depravity begins with the sche-matic relation between Books I and II. The
            puniness of the Lilliputians as they re-enact the doings of European societies is a comment on the latter
            which becomes increasingly stinging as Gulliver realizes that Europeans appear to the Brobdingnagians
            exactly as Lilliputians appear to him. The schematism is arithmetic-ally very exact, as to the physical
            proportions between Lilliputians, humans, and Brobdingnagians, but some of its ostensible signals are
            subjected to disturbance or surprise. The Lilliputians are portrayed almost throughout as unedifyingly
            similar to corrupt Europeans, but in chapter vi they are suddenly described without warning as a Utopian
            commonwealth, not in every way appealing to a modern</p>

        <p>sensibility, but nevertheless recognizably modelled on the ideal commonwealths of Plato and Thomas More, and
            foreshadowing the ideally ordered Houyhnhnm society of Book IV. This is diﬃcult to square with all previous
            portrayals of Lilliput, until, after several paragraphs of exposure to the bizarre uncertainty, we get an
            explanation that the Utopian Lilliput is a thing of the past:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In relating these and the following Laws, I would only be understood to mean the original Institutions, and
            not the most scandalous Corruptions into which these People are fallen by the degenerate Nature of Man. For
            as to that infamous Practice of acquiring great Employments by dancing on the Ropes, or Badges of Favour and
            Distinction by leaping over Sticks, and creeping under them; the Reader is to observe, that they were first
            introduced by the Grand-father of the Emperor now reigning; and grew to the present Height, by the gradual
            Increase of Party and Faction. (i. vi)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The switch is so abrupt that some critics have thought that chapter</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>was drafted for some other purpose or context, and eventually inserted into Book I, and that the anomaly
                had then to be repaired by this explanatory adjustment cobbled for the occasion.<sup>34</sup> In fact,
                the shock reversal does not seem extraordinary as an example of Swift&rsquo;s way of destabilizing the
                reading process. It also initiates a series of reflections on historical change which are taken up again
                in the next two Books.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A parallel situation in reverse occurs in Brobdingnag, a broadly good society whose King is able to denounce
            the nastiness of Gulliver&rsquo;s compatriots, and whose moral superiority to European humans is reinforced
            by a gigantic physical stature. Just as the Lilliputians are revealed to have had a constitution of great
            value before descending to their present state, so the Brobdingnagians, in reverse sequence, were once no
            better than other nations:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For, in the Course of many Ages they have been troubled with the same Disease, to which the whole Race of
            Mankind is Subject; the Nobility often contending for Power, the People for Liberty, and the King for
            absolute Dominion. All which, however happily tempered by the Laws of that Kingdom, have been sometimes
            violated by each of the three Parties; and have more than once occasioned Civil Wars, the last whereof was
            happily put an End to by this Prince&rsquo;s Grandfather by a general Composition . . . (i i. vii)</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The passage refers to a technical concern over the propriety of standing armies, but transcends this issue
            into a wider consideration of processes of political change. Together with the passage from i. vi, it shows
            an interest in historical cycles. The reference in each case to a change from a royal grandfather to his
            grandchildren supports not the specific historical allegory of a <em>roman &agrave; clef</em> (the search
            for precise correspondences has usually proved futile) so much as a general sense of processes of
            generational change.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The same generational span is suggested in Book III, when Gulliver, in Glubbdubdrib, is disappointed with his
            summoning of the famous dead from the past, and desires instead to see the humbler exemplars of defunct
            English decencies:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I descended so low as to desire that some <em>English</em> Yeomen of the old Stamp, might be summoned to
            appear; once so famous for the Simplicity of their Manners, Dyet and Dress; for Justice in their Dealings;
            for their true Spirit of Liberty; for their Valour and Love of their Country. Neither could I be wholly
            unmoved after comparing the Living with the Dead, when I considered how all these pure native Virtues were
            prostituted for a Piece of Money by their Grand-children; who in selling their Votes, and managing at
            Elections have acquired every Vice and Corruption that can possibly be learned in a Court. (i i i. viii)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Again, the local concern with individual issues (corrupt elections) is transcended by a larger interest in
            historical change. Here the appeal is to an older time of English virtue not easy to identify, and roughly
            comparable to the Roman past of King Numa or the early Republic, nostalgically evoked in Juvenal&rsquo;s
            satires. As in the two previous Books, change occurs over a similar generational span, downwards in Books I
            and III, upwards in Book II. Present-day England is directly parallel to the societies described in Books I
            and III, to its discredit; it is inversely parallel to the society of Book II, also to its discredit.
            Historical cycles are often pessimistic concepts. In theory, good and bad succeed one another, but as Plato
            implies, it is the downward cycles that tend to prevail. The story Swift tells about England, and other
            human societies, is that they are usually deteriorating.</p>

        <p>A peculiar equivalence establishes itself in Books I and II between size and virtue. It rests on a rhetorical

        <p>reflects moral stature. The ill-governed and disagreeable Lilliputians are incrementally contemptible because
            of their tiny size, while the Brobdingnagians tower above humans in dignity and virtue, their physical
            height coinciding with their possession of the moral high ground. Characteristically, we are shown
            Brobdingnagians who do not live up to their best standards, and who are, for example, mercenary or cruel.
            Moreover, though bigger usually seems best, it is a consequence of size that it magnifies imperfections. The
            sores and cancers on the breasts of Brobdingnagian women, or the wen on the neck of their male
            counter-example (i i. i, iv, v), are more unsightly to Gulliver than the smooth skins of English ladies, but
            also tell us that this is how English ladies, and Gulliver himself, would appear to Lilliputians.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These mainly optical examples rest on modern scientific aware-ness, acquired through the invention in the
            previous century of the telescope and microscope. They show that Swift was not above respecting, and making
            creative satirical use of, what he recognized as good science, in spite of his well-known contempt for Royal
            Society experimentation, whose truth and utility seemed opaque to him, and which he attacked in the Academy
            of Lagado in Book III. But the ironies of size in Books I and II have a further eﬀect. By suggesting that
            our bodies would look as repulsive in a minuter scale of vision as Brobdingnagian bodies do to Gulliver,
            Swift is implying a kind of incriminating flaw in the human physique which may be thought of as the physical
            counterpart of original sin. All humans have it, and there is no way of escaping or eradicating it. The
            impli-cation is similar to that of the memorable sentence in Swift&rsquo;s earlier masterpiece, <em>A Tale
                of a Tub</em> (1704), &lsquo;Last Week I saw a Woman <em>fl</em><em>ay&rsquo;d</em>, and you will hardly
            believe, how much it altered her Person for the worse&rsquo; (<em>Tale</em>, ix).<sup>35</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The context seems to suggest that the woman was a whore being whipped and carted, and that the punishment may
            be presumed to serve her right. But, as has been pointed out elsewhere, it is also evident that the most
            virtuous human would similarly appear the worse for being flayed, and there is an ominous subtextual crackle
            to the eﬀect that every human being is in principle caught up in the predicament of this whore. If the logic
            of this implication contains</p>

        <p>escape routes (we don&rsquo;t all deserve flaying), the poetry is clear (we would all look the worse for
            flaying, no matter who we were or what we did). You cannot unflay a woman, or make her look better flayed
            than unflayed, any more than you can change the fact of pores or moles. As in <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s
                Travels</em>, the example of the woman is com-plemented by that of a man whose corpse is being
            dissected, once again signalling that the reach of the observation is not confined to women.<sup>36</sup>
            That women are often reported on in such contexts as an initial or initiating instance, may or may not
            suggest a special Swiftian animus. But, as I have suggested, they are usually quickly redefined as exemplary
            not of the female sex, but of a Yahoo humanity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The moral inculpations of physical size, unlike the positive moral stature which runs in some sense against
            these, remain undeveloped or recessive in the first two books. Nor is there any extension in the rest of
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> of the neat schematism that binds these two books together. Book III
            consists of visits to a number of countries which provide the occasion for extended exposure of the
            nastiness of totalitarian rule, the oppression of Ireland by England, the depraved folly (intellectual as
            well as political) of scientific research establish-ments, and, in the glimpse of otherworldly worthies in
            Glubbdubdrib, the tarnished stature of several revered figures from the past. The inhabitants of the lands
            in Book III are of normal human size, though the settings (a flying island, the country of the afterlife)
            and cultures (conversing with things rather than words) are those of otherworldly or outlandish fantasy.
            None is a wholly or mainly real-istic setting, any more than that of Book IV is, a fact which touches on the
            mendacity of travel books, and exists in constant friction with the matter of fact narration and
            Gulliver&rsquo;s protestations of veracity. But the first three books for the most part portray follies and
            depravities that are specific and self-evidently culpable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The case of the Brobdingnagian breasts, monstrous and horrify-ing, is not self-evidently culpable, however.
            The example implicates all of us, because it is strongly emphasized that we are all included in the
            phenomenon, since this is how we appear to Lilliputians. If there</p>

            <li>Swift used &lsquo;flayed&rsquo; elsewhere to mean anatomical dissection, but this does not seem a normal
                usage (it is not recorded as a definition in its own right in <em>OED</em>), and is a deliberately
                violent metaphor for what satirical surgeons do (<em>PW</em> 157&ndash;8). In the <em>Tale</em>, the
                reader&rsquo;s first encounter with the flayed woman seems calculated to suggest a painful street scene,
                only subsequently to be changed by the extended application to an anatomist&rsquo;s dissection.</li>

            <em>Introduction</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>is no suggestion of active wrongdoing on our part, a touch of unspecific inculpation is clearly sensed. This
            is compounded by suggestions of secondary culpability (complacent ignorance of human squalor, misplaced
            pride in the body), but is in itself unspecific and universal, like original sin. <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s
                Travels</em> is a secular book, but its sense of an inherent human depravity acts as a secular analogue
            to original sin, or draws strength from that doc-trine, and the physical marks of a defectiveness that is
            radical, uni-versal, and incurable, go with the territory.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The intimations of this through most of the first three books remain undeveloped, as I suggested. In all
            three humanity is portrayed in acts of moral turpitude, political misgovernment, colo-nial subjugation,
            legal malpractice, and intellectual folly. We know why they are wrong, and can in principle contemplate the
            idea of improvement through changes in behaviour or circumstance, though these bad things are so ubiquitous,
            and their cumulative eﬀect so overwhelming, that it is hard in practice to imagine the likelihood of any
            change for the better. Towards the end of Book III, however, Gulliver encounters in the land of Luggnagg a
            small population called the Struldbruggs, who are born with &lsquo;a red circular Spot . . .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>over the left Eye-brow&rsquo; which eventually grows black, and signifies that they will never die (i i i.
            x). It is the last of the exotic groups Gulliver meets before Book IV, and marks a decisive turning point in
            the work as a whole.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On hearing of the Struldbruggs, Gulliver is full of expectations of the happiness, virtue, and wisdom that he
            thinks immortality is bound to confer, with its boundless opportunities for acquiring knowledge and
            experience, in the freedom and disengagement of a mind unencumbered &lsquo;by the continual Apprehension of
            Death&rsquo;. In fact, the Struldbruggs have perpetual life without perpetual youth, and thus inevitably
            deteriorate physically, mentally, and morally, once again activating reciprocities of valuation which are
            already the subject of Books I and II, and here especially evoking a strong resemblance between decrepitude
            and depravity:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When they came to Fourscore Years, which is reckoned the Extremity of living in this Country, they had not
            only all the Follies and Infirmities of other old Men, but many more which arose from the dreadful Prospect
            of never dying. They were not only opinionative, peevish, covetous, mor-ose, vain, talkative; but uncapable
            of Friendship, and dead to all natural</p>

        <p>Aﬀection, which never descended below their Grand-children. Envy and impotent Desires, are their prevailing
            Passions . . .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At Ninety they lose their Teeth and Hair; they have at that Age no Distinction of Taste, but eat and drink
            whatever they can get, without Relish or Appetite. The Diseases they were subject to, still continue without
            encreasing or diminishing. In talking, they forget the common Appellation of Things, and the Names of
            Persons, even of those who are their nearest Friends and Relations . . .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were the most mortifying Sight I ever beheld; and the Women more horrible than the Men. Besides the
            usual Deformities in extreme old Age, they acquired an additional Ghastliness in Proportion to their Number
            of Years, which is not to be described . . . (i i i. x)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&lsquo;The women more horrible than the Men&rsquo; may be evidence of &lsquo;misogyny&rsquo;, or planted for
            the benefit of those who like collecting such evidence, as Gulliver oﬀered scatological material for those
            who liked accusing Swift of scatology (i. ii). Gulliver had already told Sympson about seeing himself
            accused &lsquo;of abusing the Female Sex&rsquo;. Or Gulliver, in Swift&rsquo;s perception, may just have
            been realistic about the anatomy of the very old. It is possible that all these elem-ents were in play. But
            the women in this brief incidental comment are merely an extreme example of what is said about all humans,
            and the strongest charge of feeling in the entire chapter has to do not with any particular sex or category,
            but with the merciless eﬀect of age on the body, mind, and morals. The depravity of the Struldbruggs is
            general, not specific; instinctive, not willed; a natural consequence of age and illness, not something they
            or anyone else can ever have prevented. We are now entering satirical territory of a new kind, in which
            depravity is not the mark of what people do, but of who they are. The Struldbruggs are a very small group,
            &lsquo;not . . . above Eleven Hundred . . . of both Sexes in the whole Kingdom&rsquo; (and these are, by
            definition, the historical grand total), but their sins and nastiness are what flesh is heir to. They sketch
            out, in a small proph-etic way, the guilt of being merely human, and thus prepare us for the Yahoos.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is in the much debated Fourth Book that the fiction brings us to a stark and irreducible definition of

        <p>are not (rational animals, like the Houyhnhnms). That Swift&rsquo;s con-cern was a definitional one, to
            challenge the traditional idea that humans, unlike other beasts, are rational animals, is made clear in the
            famous letter to Pope of 29 September 1725, written as Swift was completing the work:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have got Materials Towards a Treatis proving the falsity of that Definition animal rationale, and to show
            it should be only <em>rationis capax</em>. Upon this great foundation of Misanthropy (though not Timons
            manner) the whole building of my Travells is erected.<sup>37</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The &lsquo;Definition animal rationale&rsquo; is the standard textbook prop-osition that humans, unlike
            beasts, have an ability to &lsquo;reason&rsquo; or think. Much ink has been spilt on <em>rationis capax</em>
            (capable of reason), but in fact the phrase does not mean anything diﬀerent from the original
            &lsquo;definition&rsquo;, in its modest textbook sense. Swift&rsquo;s friend Bolingbroke wrote to him on 14
            December 1725: &lsquo;Your Definition of Animal capax Rationis instead of the Common one Animal Rationale,
            will not bear examination&rsquo;.<sup>38</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In both the letter and the fiction, Swift is engaging in a verbal tease. The absolute rationality of the
            Houyhnhnms, modelled on Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em> and More&rsquo;s <em>Utopia</em>, rests on a high or
            ideal use of the word &lsquo;reason&rsquo; which was never intended in the definition of <em>animal
                rationale</em>. Swift&rsquo;s tactic is to pretend otherwise, in order to say to the reader, &lsquo;if
            you think man is a rational animal, let me show you what a really rational animal is like&rsquo;. This has
            no logic as a response to the &lsquo;definition&rsquo;, but its poetry, so to speak, carries a cheekily
            insulting sting. The deadpan violation of logic is elaborately sustained by Swift&rsquo;s attribution of the
            high rationality to a society of talking horses, since the textbooks which taught the definition habitually
            gave the horse as the example of choice of a beast possessing all faculties <em>except</em> reason. The
            association was proverbial. The hero of Samuel Butler&rsquo;s <em>Hudibras</em> (1663&ndash;78), a favourite
            poem of Swift&rsquo;s, was &lsquo;in <em>Logick</em> a great Critick&rsquo;, who would</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Swift&rsquo;s use, in the composition of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>, as well as in many details of the
            letter to Pope, of the textbooks in philosophy habitually taught in the universities of Europe at the time,
            is now well understood. It establishes that, contrary to the bantering denial in the letter, he is not
            challenging the truth of the &lsquo;definition&rsquo;, for what that was, but rubbing in the fact that
            humans have no right to pretend to the virtues of high rationality, falling catastrophically short of a
            noble ideal. It is only by a verbal sleight of hand that this shortfall can be redefined as a lack of
            &lsquo;reason&rsquo; in the definitional sense. The trick enables Swift to imagine a world in which horses
            have wisdom while human-shaped creatures are bestial, and pretend that the &lsquo;definition&rsquo; has been
            rebutted. It is an insulting &lsquo;logical&rsquo; refutation, but it acts only as an imaginative ploy or
            debating point, and has no substance other than to suggest, again, that if humans are like the Yahoo
            humanoids, they are no better than their worst sub-groups, &lsquo;low-species&rsquo; or
            &lsquo;low-race&rsquo;, as some people are described as low-class.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Swift&rsquo;s correspondence with Pope is full of bantering tease. Its famous phrases, &lsquo;I hate and
            detest that animal called man&rsquo;, &lsquo;this great foundation of Misanthropy (though not Timons
            manner)&rsquo;, have an air of playful overstatement which distances the writer from the full literal force
            of his words, without contradicting them: the denial of &lsquo;Timons manner&rsquo; merely means that the
            &lsquo;misanthropy&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be that of a ranting recluse, like the Timon of Lucian or Shakespeare.
            Swift&rsquo;s letters about <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> are a rich guide to attitudes, so long as the
            habitual obliquities of his style are taken into proper account. In a subsequent letter to Pope of 26
            November 1725, he reversed his acknowledgement of misanthropy by an apparent denial:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I tell you after all that I do not hate Mankind, it is vous autr[e]s who hate them because you would have
            them reasonable Animals, and are Angry for being disappointed.</p>

        <p>It is evident even from this that the supposed denial cannot be taken at face value, though there have been
            some insistent attempts to do so. At all events, the letter continues:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

            high and low, or ideal and mundane (or technical) senses of the word &lsquo;reason&rsquo;, the same is true
            of the word &lsquo;nature&rsquo; throughout Book IV. The Houyhnhnms&rsquo; name, we are told, means
            &lsquo;<em>the Perfection of Nature</em>&rsquo; (i v. iii), and they live &lsquo;according to&rsquo; Nature
            and Reason in a high sense in which the two terms coalesce. The Houyhnhnms, who don&rsquo;t have laws, are
            sur-prised that Gulliver&rsquo;s countrymen should need them, because, as the master thought, &lsquo;Nature
            and Reason were suﬃcient Guides for a reasonable Animal, as we pretended to be, in shewing us what we ought
            to do, and what to avoid&rsquo; (i v. v). Nature is the term for an ideal order in the sense in which we
            still speak of a gross misdeed as an &lsquo;unnatural act&rsquo;, even if it was committed spontaneously and
            in con-formity with the perpetrator&rsquo;s &lsquo;natural&rsquo; impulses, or his &lsquo;nature&rsquo;. The
            latter meaning is a lower usage existing in a tension with the higher, a tension which is often present in
            ordinary speech, and is a matter of systematic awareness and exploitation in Book IV.<sup>41</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This same tension underlies the irony of Gulliver&rsquo;s complaint in the Letter to Sympson that he has been
            accused of &lsquo;degrading human Nature, (for so they have still the Confidence to stile it)&rsquo;. The
            remark suggests that &lsquo;nature&rsquo; is a misnomer when applied to humans. In practice, however,
            Gulliver speaks of our &lsquo;natural Vices&rsquo;, reporting for example that the master Houyhnhnm told him
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That, although he hated the <em>Yahoos</em> of this Country, yet he no more blamed them for their odious
            Qualities, than he did a <em>Gnnayh</em> (a bird of</p>

        <p>Prey) for its Cruelty, or a sharp Stone for cutting his Hoof. But, when a Creature pretending to Reason,
            could be capable of such Enormities, he dreaded lest the Corruption of that Faculty might be worse than
            Brutality itself. He seemed therefore confident, that instead of Reason, we were only possessed of some
            Quality fitted to increase our natural Vices . . . (i v. v)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The idea of nature is here taken down two successive twists of a descending spiral. The Yahoos have a natural
            depravity analogous to that of a <em>Gnnayh</em> or bird of prey, whom it is appropriate to hate but not to
            blame, like the kite in Swift&rsquo;s letter of 26 November 1725, which flew away with one of Swift&rsquo;s
            chickens, and was shot two days later: the <em>gnnayh</em> and the kite are evidently echoes of one another,
            whichever was written first.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The kite in the letter is to some extent like men, whom Swift professes not to hate or be angry with because
            they know no better. But a further distinction is introduced. It is Yahoos, not us, whom the Houyhnhnm says
            he hates but does not blame. For &lsquo;us&rsquo; he reserves a further escalation of opprobrium, since we
            do know better, and since in our case it is reason itself which appears &lsquo;to increase our natural
            Vices&rsquo;. It is bad enough if vices can be &lsquo;natural&rsquo;, but if reason can increase these, a
            new escalation of depravity has to be conceded. The Houyhnhnm hopes there&rsquo;s another explanation, but
            the language of Book IV never allows this matter to rest. In a later conversation, about the sexual mores of
            the Yahoos, and their bearing on our own, Gulliver reports:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I expected every Moment, that my Master would accuse the <em>Yahoos</em> of those unnatural Appetites in both
            Sexes, so common among us. But Nature it seems hath not been so expert a Schoolmistress; and these politer
            Pleasures are entirely the Productions of Art and Reason, on our Side of the Globe. (i v. vii)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If much of Book IV intimates that humans are essentially the same as Yahoos, and also somewhat superior to
            them, there is a simultaneous irony to the eﬀect that in some ways humans are worse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These disconcertingly conflicting signals emerge cumulatively from such passages. In a similar barrage of
            mixed signals, humans are denied the reason they take pride in, but also have it, and it makes them worse.
            These are inconsistencies of incrimination, each of them oﬀered as true, and the atmosphere of generalized
            culpability,</p>

            <em>Introduction</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of either-way-you-lose, is locked in more tightly with each turn of the screw. The sense that emerges is one
            of radical incurability of the human condition, grounded in the &lsquo;nature&rsquo; of the human animal,
            and imprisoningly reaﬃrmed each time that &lsquo;nature&rsquo; is redefined. That these redefinitions occur
            in defiance of a local logic (our lack of reason makes us worse than we think we are, but our possession of
            it makes us even worse than that) causes discomfiture to the reader and is part of what Swift meant when he
            wrote to Pope that he was determined to &lsquo;vex&rsquo; the world rather than &lsquo;divert&rsquo; it.
            This satirical manner is the opposite of the one practised by Pope (or Fielding, or Gibbon), which aims to
            establish solidarity with the reader against a bad world. Swift&rsquo;s way is to disconcert and
            destabilize, creating a quarrelsome ambience in which the reader is treated as belonging to the enemy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Swift has been described as a satirist &lsquo;of the second person&rsquo;, and it is in the deep logic of his
            account of humanity that there should be no exceptions. Sniping at the reader may be an expression of
            temperamental aggressiveness, but it contributes to the suggestion that the reader, if only as a member of
            the human race, is included in the general inculpation. In that sense, it follows that the narra-tor and the
            satirist are similarly included, a fact of which Gulliver is painfully aware, and from which Swift often
            makes clear (in many of his writings) that he also is not exempt. Whatever improvements are available to
            humankind from good institutions and laws and the practical accommodations of everyday life, the account of
            humanity at the essential definitional level is bleak and uncompromising.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>&lsquo;Exterminate from the Face of the Earth&rsquo;</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The universal depravity suggested by the work as a whole may per-haps be compared with the generalized dismay
            at human doings which God is said to have felt just before he released the deluge: &lsquo;I will destroy man
            whom I have created from the face of the earth&rsquo; (Genesis 6: 7). The Book of Genesis, which is an
            important textual presence in Book IV (although <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> is not a religious
            allegory, and its concerns are secular), does not tell us in specific terms what the wickedness was that
            made God angry. This creates an atmosphere in which the wickedness seems self-evident and com-</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Introduction</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            xxxix</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>prehensively incriminating, an eﬀect not unlike Swift&rsquo;s, except that Swift&rsquo;s fiction also
            provides, on another plane, a large documentation of bad doings. It is not a coincidence that when the
            Houyhnhnm Assembly debates the Yahoos, it does so in the language of scriptural punishment: &lsquo;The
            Question to be debated was, Whether the <em>Yahoos</em> should be exterminated from the Face of the
            Earth&rsquo; (i v. ix).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This language has led some interpreters to argue that Swift portrayed the Houyhnhnms as genocidal murderers,
            thus inviting us to read the book as disapproving of them. To this one might answer first that the Yahoos
            are beasts in the eyes of the Houyhnhnms, so that exterminating them would be no diﬀerent from exterminating
            some farmyard pest in the human world. That the Yahoos neverthe-less seem human to the reader adds a black
            humorous touch, no doubt calculated to oﬀend us, but without erasing the main point that in the story they
            are an alien and unhygienic species. Secondly, the extermination is never carried out. The latest proposal
            is not said to have been implemented, so that it hangs over the situation as a disturbing possibility,
            without the potentially alienating shock of an &lsquo;actual&rsquo; extermination, though a selective
            culling had already been made in the past.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To the extent that a biblical association suggests divine retribu-tion, there is a macabre hint of just
            deserts. The real diﬃculty about supposing the Houyhnhnms to be genocidal tyrants is the clear evocation of
            God&rsquo;s words in Genesis 6: 7. If the Houyhnhnms are genocidal, so is God, and the dominant implication
            in both the Old Testament and <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> is not that a wanton massacre is taking
            place, but that mankind deserves the punishment. The divine utterance acquired currency, not only in later
            books of the Old Testament but in more recent history, as a preferred vocabu-lary of systematic slaughter,
            recurrently parodied as such in Defoe&rsquo;s <em>Shortest-Way with the Dissenters</em>. Ironically, it was
            used by the Nazis, about whom Swift did not know, but to whom the Houyhnhnms have been compared. Indeed, the
            arguments as to whether the Yahoos should be killed outright, or castrated (which would have the same result
            a generation later), and as to how either scheme bears on the fact that Yahoo labour is useful to the
            Houyhnhnm economy, prefigure the Nazi example with uncanny precision. In an earlier round-up, the Houyhnhnms
            had once herded the Yahoos in a camp before a selective extermination, and elsewhere in Book IV</p>

            <em>Introduction</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>useful objects are manufactured by Gulliver from the skins of Yahoos.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These resemblances speak tellingly to the modern reader. They show an insight into the mental configurations
            of violent oppression, as these inhabit an exploring and creative imagination, or on the other hand provoke
            homicidal atrocities in the realm of action. They have about them the dimension of black humour which the
            Surrealist Andr&eacute; Breton identified with Swift on the eve of the Second World War, seeing it as a form
            of cruel play, in which the imagination is set free among prohibited or unspeakable matters, without the
            &lsquo;degrad-ing influence&rsquo; of satirical or moralistic purposes.<sup>42</sup> It is implausible to
            think of Swift as jettisoning such purposes, but there is a powerful sense, recognized by many readers, in
            which his writing often spills over its oﬃcial meaning or tendency, flirting disturbingly with the
            forbidden, or indecent, or cruel, and this too is related to his special interest in his reader&rsquo;s
            discomfort. This is very diﬀerent from having, or endorsing, Nazi characteristics, or from attributing them,
            whether in complicity or disparagement, to the Houyhnhnms. Had Swift known about the Nazis, the example of
            his treatment of lesser tyrannies and oppressions makes it clear that he would have instanced them as a
            culminating example of Yahoo depravity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Gulliver and the Gentle Reader</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A diﬃculty for the reader is that all this material is mediated through a narrator who is variously
            unreliable, and who in the later parts of the story, prefigured in the 1735 edition by the Letter to
            Sympson, seems actually deranged. The suggestion, as the story unfolds, is that he has been shattered into
            total misanthropy by his experience of human doings and the revelation of the Houyhnhnm Utopia. This Utopia,
            like More&rsquo;s commonwealth of that name, and like Plato&rsquo;s Republic, is a &lsquo;no place&rsquo;, a
            country of the mind, unavailable to human aspiration except as a notional ideal. The sting is that the
            &lsquo;no place&rsquo;, which is also (through a pun on two Greek words) a &lsquo;good place&rsquo;, is not
            for us. But it teaches Gulliver a standard by which humanity falls short, and he is apparently
            &lsquo;crazed&rsquo; by the experience. The formula is a tried way of expressing satirical disaﬀection. It
            corresponds in</p>

        <p>colloquial speech to the situations in which we say that something &lsquo;drives us crazy&rsquo; or
            &lsquo;makes us mad&rsquo;, but is open to a multitude of fictional elaborations.</p>
        <p>One such is the close of the Letter to Sympson:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I must freely confess, that since my last Return, some Corruptions of my <em>Yahoo</em> Nature have revived
            in me by Conversing with a few of your Species, and particularly those of mine own Family, by an unavoidable
            Necessity; else I should never have attempted so absurd a Project as that of reforming the <em>Yahoo</em>
            Race in this Kingdom; but, I have now done with all such visionary Schemes for ever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The idea that the world is unmendable, that the satirist is a fool for trying, is one of the oldest in
            satire, and occurs in various forms in all Swift&rsquo;s major satires from <em>A Tale of a Tub</em> to
            <em>A Modest Proposal</em>. It goes with the ambiguous idea that if the world is mad and bad, the
            satirist&rsquo;s virtue will itself appear mad by that standard, ambiguous because one can be virtuously
            crazed, like the Modest Proposer, into a vicious alienation, like that of proposing a wholesale cannibal
            trade, though the latter is itself a reflection of the supposed depravity of the satirized population.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gulliver&rsquo;s alienations are more benign. He is rude to the Portuguese captain, and prefers the horses in
            his stable to his wife and family (i v. xi). Some modest accommodations to human society are intimated in
            the front matter, approvingly by Richard Sympson in &lsquo;The Publisher to the Reader&rsquo;,
            disapprovingly by Gulliver him-self, who refers to Yahoo corruptions which &lsquo;have revived in me by
            conversing with a few of your Species, and particularly those of mine own Family&rsquo;. These changes are
            reported in prefatory pieces, but they post-date the last words of Book IV, where Gulliver is wholly
            unreconciled. The last words, after Gulliver&rsquo;s report on human pride, are:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I dwell the longer upon this Subject from the Desire I have to make the Society of an <em>English Yahoo</em>
            by any Means not insupportable; and there-fore I here intreat those who have any Tincture of this absurd
            Vice, that they will not presume to appear in my Sight. (i v. xii)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is about as unfriendly a treatment of the &lsquo;gentle Reader&rsquo; as anything in Swift&rsquo;s
            writings. The language is petulantly unsocial, and clearly in breach of polite conversational manners. Any
            comfort we may take from the thought that Gulliver is deranged must</p>

        <p>contend with the fact that the reading stops on this sour note, and there is no competing voice oﬀering an
            alternative point of view.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The reader should have become accustomed by now to a certain withdrawal of conversational good manners. The
            book&rsquo;s prevailing tone is quarrelsome and disorientating, programmed to &lsquo;vex&rsquo; rather than
            divert, and it is the antithesis of more conventional satirical styles which purport to engage the
            reader&rsquo;s solidarity. The fact that Gulliver&rsquo;s attitudes seem unbalanced or unsocial acts not so
            much to let humankind oﬀ the hook as to distance the author from being partially discredited by what appears
            to be excessive utterance. Since the account of human doings cannot be shrugged oﬀ as untrue,
            Gulliver&rsquo;s response appears &lsquo;deranged&rsquo; only because its truth has made him so, and if
            Swift has made him act in a comically unbal-anced fashion it is clear that Swift is distancing himself from
            the comedy of excess without conceding any flaw in the diagnosis which brought it about. The lofty accents
            of Juvenalian denunciation, or the rant of &lsquo;Timons manner&rsquo;, are exactly what Swift guarded
            against. As he said in another context, he declined a lofty style, partly fearing to &lsquo;make a Figure
            scurvy&rsquo;.<sup>43</sup> If anything, Swift&rsquo;s dis-sociation from Gulliver&rsquo;s manner rather
            than his matter (as he told Pope he rejected Timon&rsquo;s manner but not the substantive misan-thropy)
            tends to disconcert rather than to palliate, since the reader may feel entitled to discount something, but
            cannot be sure what, or how much.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The reader is left, at the end, to negotiate this mood in a void, without support or signposts from the
            author. Gulliver may be deranged, but there is nobody to tell us any better, or to relieve the discomfort of
            this &lsquo;vexing&rsquo; alienation. The whole work&rsquo;s radical assault on human nature has settled, in
            the reverberating afterlife of a reading, on the reader&rsquo;s frayed defences, where in truth it has been
            all along. This merely accentuates the &lsquo;logic&rsquo; of the general diag-nosis, which is that, if
            humans are what the story says, this includes the reader, along with more passable specimens like the King
            of Brobdingnag in Book II, Lord Munodi in Book III, the Portuguese Captain in Book IV, and indeed the author
            himself. Good readers have always understood that Swift is, in clear-eyed mischievousness, implicated in his
            own satire.</p>

        <p>Unsurprisingly, he has for some become the type of the demonic, raging misanthrope, best known through
            Thackeray&rsquo;s famous denunciation.<sup>44</sup> That view ignores Swift&rsquo;s carefully calibrated
            rejec-tion of the righteous denunciations of &lsquo;Timons manner&rsquo;, his persist-ent preference for
            working aggressively in a lower key, and his fastidious humour on the subject of Gulliver&rsquo;s eccentric
            excesses. But Thackeray&rsquo;s view is closer to the truth than that of readers who, in the late Ph.D. era,
            have seen in Swift a bland model of civic virtue, promoting postcolonial pieties, and repudiating the

        <p><em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> is also a very funny book, and a consummate work of other-worldly fiction,
            operating with a brilliant inventive-ness in a mode of science-fiction realism. We should not forget that
            some early readers took it for real. Swift had the skills, though not, like Defoe, the instincts, of a
            novelist. He took care, in <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s</em> <em>Travels</em> and elsewhere, to disabuse gullible
            readers of any &lsquo;illusion&rsquo; that they were witnessing life rather than reading fiction. But the
            power to create what he was eager to neutralize may be part of the appeal of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s
                Travels</em> as a children&rsquo;s book, usually, in that for-mat, stripped of the bleaker satiric
            content and the aggressions against the reader. If <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> contains parody of
            Defoe, this necessarily includes mimicry of Defoe&rsquo;s skills as a mimic. The sarcastic idiom which
            undermines this, to a sensitive reader&rsquo;s discomfort, tends to be dropped in children&rsquo;s
            adaptations, which perhaps helps partly to explain why one of the world&rsquo;s most disturbing satires has
            also survived as a children&rsquo;s classic.</p>

        <p>NOTE ON THE TEXT</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h e text of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> given here is taken from volume xi of Herbert Davis&rsquo;s
            edition of Swift&rsquo;s <em>Prose Writings</em> (1965 reprint). It is based on volume iii of George
            Faulkner&rsquo;s Dublin edition of Swift&rsquo;s <em>Works</em> (1735). This text of 1735 seems to have come
            closer to what Swift originally wrote than the first edition of 1726, and also to have contained revisions
            representing his last ideas for the book.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I h o p e you will be ready to own publickly, whenever you shall be called to it, that by your great and
            frequent Urgency you prevailed on me to publish a very loose and uncorrect Account of my Travels; with
            Direction to hire some young Gentlemen of either University to put them in Order, and correct the Style, as
            my Cousin <em>Dampier</em>* did by my Advice, in his Book called, <em>A Voyage round the World</em>. But I
            do not remember I gave you Power to consent, that any thing should be omitted, and much less that any thing
            should be inserted: There-fore, as to the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that Kind; particularly
            a Paragraph* about her Majesty the late Queen <em>Anne</em>, of most pious and glorious Memory; although I
            did reverence and esteem her more than any of human Species. But you, or your Inter-polator, ought to have
            considered, that as it was not my Inclination, so was it not decent to praise any Animal of our Composition*
            before my Master <em>Houyhnhnm</em>:* And besides, the Fact was altogether false; for to my Knowledge, being
            in <em>England</em> during some Part of her Majesty&rsquo;s Reign, she did govern by a chief Minister; nay,
            even by two successively; the first whereof was the Lord of <em>Godolphin</em>, and the second the Lord of
            <em>Oxford</em>;* so that you have made me <em>say the thing that was not</em>.* Likewise, in the Account of
            the Academy of Projectors, and several Passages of my Discourse to my Master <em>Houyhnhnm</em>, you have
            either omitted some material Circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a Manner, that I do hardly
            know mine own Work.* When I formerly hinted to you something of this in a Letter, you were pleased to
            answer, that you were afraid of giving Oﬀence; that People in Power were very watchful over the Press; and
            apt not only to interpret, but to punish every thing which looked like an <em>Inuendo</em> (as I think you
            called it.)* But pray, how could that which I spoke so many Years ago, and at about five Thousand Leagues
            dis-tance, in another Reign, be applyed to any of the <em>Yahoos</em>,* who now are said to govern the Herd;
            especially, at a time when I little thought on or feared the Unhappiness of living under them. Have not I
            the most Reason to complain, when I see these very <em>Yahoos</em> carried by <em>Houyhnhnms</em> in a
            Vehicle, as if these* were Brutes, and those* the rational Creatures? And, indeed, to avoid so monstrous and

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>detestable a Sight, was one principal Motive of my Retirement hither.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thus much I thought proper to tell you in Relation to yourself, and to the Trust I reposed in you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I do in the next Place complain of my own great Want of Judgment, in being prevailed upon by the Intreaties
            and false Reasonings of you and some others, very much against mine own Opinion, to suﬀer my Travels to be
            published. Pray bring to your Mind how often I desired you to consider, when you insisted on the Motive of
            <em>publick Good</em>; that the <em>Yahoos</em> were a Species of Animals utterly incapable of Amendment by
            Precepts or Examples: And so it hath proved; for instead of seeing a full Stop put to all Abuses and
            Corruptions, at least in this little Island, as I had Reason to expect: Behold, after above six Months
            Warning, I cannot learn that my Book hath pro-duced one single Eﬀect according to mine Intentions: I desired
            you would let me know by a Letter, when Party and Faction were extin-guished; Judges learned and upright;
            Pleaders honest and modest, with some Tincture of common Sense; and <em>Smith</em><em>fi</em><em>eld</em>*
            blazing with Pyramids of Law-Books; the young Nobility&rsquo;s Education entirely changed; the Physicians
            banished; the Female <em>Yahoos</em> abounding in Virtue, Honour, Truth and good Sense: Courts and Levees of
            great Ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; Wit, Merit and Learning rewarded; all Disgracers of the Press
            in Prose and Verse, condemned to eat nothing but their own Cotten* and quench their Thirst with their own
            Ink. These, and a Thousand other Reformations, I firmly counted upon by your Encouragement; as indeed they
            were plainly deducible from the Precepts delivered in my Book. And, it must be owned, that seven Months were
            a suﬃcient Time to correct every Vice and Folly to which <em>Yahoos</em> are subject; if their Natures had
            been capable of the least Disposition to Virtue or Wisdom: Yet so far have you been from answering mine
            Expectation in any of your Letters; that on the contrary, you are loading our Carrier every Week with
            Libels, and Keys, and Reflections, and Memoirs, and Second Parts;* wherein I see myself accused of
            reflecting upon great States-Folk; of degrading human Nature, (for so they have still the Confidence to
            stile it), and of abusing the Female Sex. I find likewise, that the Writers of those Bundles are not agreed
            among themselves; for some of them will not allow me to be Author of mine own Travels; and others make me
            Author of Books to which I am wholly a Stranger.</p>

        <p>I find likewise, that your Printer hath been so careless as to con-found the Times,* and mistake the Dates of
            my several Voyages and Returns; neither assigning the true Year, or the true Month, or Day of the Month: And
            I hear the original Manuscript is all destroyed,* since the Publication of my Book. Neither have I any Copy
            left; however, I have sent you some Corrections, which you may insert, if ever there should be a second
            Edition: And yet I cannot stand to them,* but shall leave that Matter to my judicious and candid Readers, to
            adjust it as they please.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I hear some of our Sea-<em>Yahoos</em> find Fault with my Sea-Language, as not proper in many Parts, nor now
            in Use.* I cannot help it. In my first Voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest Mariners,
            and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found that the Sea-<em>Yahoos</em> are apt, like the Land
            ones, to become new fangled in their Words; which the latter change every Year; insomuch, as I remember upon
            each Return to mine own Country, their old Dialect was so altered, that I could hardly understand the new.
            And I observe, when any <em>Yahoo</em> comes from <em>London</em> out of Curiosity to visit me at mine own
            House, we neither of us are able to deliver our Conceptions* in a Manner intelligible to the other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the Censure of <em>Yahoos</em> could any Way aﬀect me, I should have great Reason to complain, that some
            of them are so bold as to think my Book of Travels a meer Fiction out of mine own Brain; and have gone so
            far as to drop Hints, that the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> and <em>Yahoos</em> have no more Existence than the
            Inhabitants of <em>Utopia</em>.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of <em>Lilliput, Brobdingrag</em>, (for so the Word should have
            been spelt, and not erroneously <em>Brobdingnag</em>), and <em>Laputa</em>, I have never yet heard of any
            <em>Yahoo</em> so presumptuous as to dispute their Being, or the Facts I have related concerning them;
            because the Truth immediately strikes every Reader with Conviction.* And, is there less Probability in my
            Account of the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> or <em>Yahoos</em>, when it is manifest as to the latter, there are so
            many Thousands even in this City, who only diﬀer from their Brother Brutes in <em>Houyhnhnmland</em>,
            because they use a Sort of <em>Jabber</em>, and do not go naked. I wrote for their Amendment, and not their
            Approbation. The united Praise of the whole Race would be of less Consequence to me, than the neighing of
            those two degenerate <em>Houyhnhnms</em> I keep in my Stable; because, from these,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>A Letter from Capt. Gulliver to his Cousin Sympson</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>degenerate as they are, I still improve in some Virtues, without any Mixture of Vice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Do these miserable Animals* presume to think that I am so far degenerated as to defend my Veracity;
            <em>Yahoo</em> as I am, it is well known through all <em>Houyhnhnmland</em>, that by the Instructions and
            Example of my illustrious Master, I was able in the Compass of two Years (although I confess with the utmost
            Diﬃculty) to remove that infernal Habit of Lying, Shuﬄing, Deceiving, and Equivocating, so deeply rooted in
            the very Souls of all my Species; especially the <em>Europeans</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have other Complaints to make upon this vexatious Occasion; but I forbear troubling myself or you any
            further. I must freely confess, that since my last Return, some Corruptions of my <em>Yahoo</em> Nature have
            revived in me by conversing with a few of your Species, and particularly those of mine own Family, by an
            unavoidable Necessity; else I should never have attempted so absurd a Project as that of reforming the
            <em>Yahoo</em> Race in this Kingdom; but I have now done with all such visionary Schemes for ever.</p>

        <p>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h e au t h o r of these Travels, Mr <em>Lemuel Gulliver</em>, is my ancient and intimate Friend; there is
            likewise some Relation between us by the Mother&rsquo;s Side. About three Years ago Mr <em>Gulliver</em>
            growing weary of the Concourse of curious People coming to him at his House in <em>Redri</em><em>ﬀ</em>,*
            made a small Purchase of Land, with a convenient House, near <em>Newark</em>, in <em>Nottinghamshire</em>,
            his native Country; where he now lives retired, yet in good Esteem among his Neighbours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although Mr <em>Gulliver</em> was born in <em>Nottinghamshire</em>, where his Father dwelt, yet I have heard
            him say, his Family came from <em>Oxford-shire</em>; to confirm which, I have observed in the Church-Yard
            at<em> Banbury</em>,* in that County, several Tombs and Monuments of the<em> Gullivers</em>.</p>
        <p>Before he quitted <em>Redri</em><em>ﬀ</em>, he left the Custody of the following Papers in my Hands, with the
            Liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit. I have carefully perused them three Times: The Style is
            very plain and simple; and the only Fault I find is, that the Author, after the Manner of Travellers, is a
            little too circumstantial. There is an Air of Truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the Author was so
            distinguished for his Veracity,* that it became a Sort of Proverb among his Neighbours at
            <em>Redri</em><em>ﬀ</em>, when any one aﬃrmed a Thing, to say, it was as true as if Mr <em>Gulliver</em> had
            spoke it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By the Advice of several worthy Persons, to whom, with the Author&rsquo;s Permission, I communicated these
            Papers, I now venture to send them into the World; hoping they may be, at least for some time, a better
            Entertainment to our young Noblemen, than the common Scribbles of Politicks and Party.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Volume would have been at least twice as large,* if I had not made bold to strike out innumerable
            Passages relating to the Winds and Tides,* as well as to the Variations and Bearings in the several Voyages;
            together with the minute Descriptions of the Management of the Ship in Storms, in the Style of Sailors:
            Likewise the Account of the Longitudes and Latitudes; wherein I have Reason to appre-hend that Mr
            <em>Gulliver</em> may be a little dissatisfied: But I was resolved to fit the Work as much as possible to
            the general Capacity of Readers. However, if my own Ignorance in Sea-Aﬀairs shall have led</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p> -->
        <p>CHAPTER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ONE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>The Author giveth some Account of himself and Family; his</em><em> fi</em><em>rst Inducements to travel.
                He is shipwrecked, and swims for his Life; gets safe on shoar in the Country of</em> Lilliput<em>; is
                made a Prisoner, and carried up the Country.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>M y father had a small Estate in <em>Nottinghamshire</em>; I was the Third of five Sons. He sent me to
            <em>Emanuel-College</em> in <em>Cambridge</em>,* at Fourteen* Years old, where I resided three Years, and
            applied my self close to my Studies: But the Charge of maintaining me (although I had a very scanty
            Allowance) being too great for a narrow Fortune; I was bound Apprentice to Mr <em>James Bates</em>, an
            eminent Surgeon in <em>London</em>, with whom I continued four Years; and my Father now and then sending me
            small Sums of Money, I laid them out in learning Navigation, and other Parts of the Mathematicks, useful to
            those who intend to travel, as I always believed it would be some time or other my Fortune to do. When I
            left Mr <em>Bates</em>, I went down to my Father; where, by the Assistance of him and my Uncle
            <em>John</em>, and some other Relations, I got Forty Pounds, and a Promise of Thirty Pounds a Year to
            maintain me at <em>Leyden</em>:* There I studied Physick two Years and seven Months, knowing it would be
            useful in long Voyages.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soon after my Return from <em>Leyden</em>, I was recommended by my good Master Mr <em>Bates</em>, to be
            Surgeon to the <em>Swallow</em>,* Captain <em>Abraham Pannell</em> Commander; with whom I continued three
            Years and a half, making a Voyage or two into the <em>Levant</em>,* and some other Parts. When I came back,
            I resolved to settle in <em>London</em>, to which Mr <em>Bates</em>, my Master, encouraged me; and by him I
            was recommended to several Patients. I took Part of a small House in the <em>Old Jury</em>;* and being
            advised to alter my Condition, I married Mrs* <em>Mary Burton</em>, second Daughter to Mr <em>Edmond
                Burton</em>, Hosier, in <em>Newgate-street</em>, with whom I received four Hundred Pounds* for a
            Portion.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, my good Master <em>Bates</em>* dying in two Years after, and I having few Friends, my Business began to
            fail; for my Conscience would not suﬀer me to imitate the bad Practice of too many among my Brethren. Having
            therefore consulted with my Wife, and some of my</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Acquaintance, I determined to go again to Sea. I was Surgeon successively in two Ships, and made several
            Voyages, for six Years, to the <em>East</em> and <em>West-Indies</em>; by which I got some Addition to my
            Fortune.* My Hours of Leisure I spent in reading the best Authors, ancient and modern; being always provided
            with a good Number of Books; and when I was ashore, in observing the Manners and Dis-positions of the
            People, as well as learning their Language; wherein I had a great Facility by the Strength of my Memory.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The last of these Voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of the Sea, and intended to stay at home
            with my Wife and Family. I removed from the <em>Old Jury</em> to <em>Fetter-Lane</em>, and from thence to
            <em>Wapping</em>,* hoping to get Business among the Sailors; but it would not turn to account. After three
            Years Expectation that things would mend, I accepted an advantageous Oﬀer from Captain <em>William
                Prichard</em>, Master of the <em>Antelope</em>, who was making a Voyage to the<em> South-Sea</em>. We
            set sail from <em>Bristol, May</em> 4th, 1699,* and our Voyage at first was very prosperous.</p>
        <p>It would not be proper for some Reasons, to trouble the Reader* with the Particulars of our Adventures in
            those Seas: Let it suﬃce to inform him, that in our Passage from thence to the <em>East-Indies</em>, we were
            driven by a violent Storm to the North-west of <em>Van Diemen</em>&rsquo;s Land.* By an Observation, we
            found ourselves in the Latitude of 30 Degrees 2 Minutes South. Twelve of our Crew were dead by immoderate
            Labour, and ill Food; the rest were in a very weak Condition. On the fifth of <em>November</em>,* which was
            the beginning of Summer in those Parts, the Weather being very hazy, the Seamen spyed a Rock, within half a
            Cable&rsquo;s length* of the Ship; but the Wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and
            immediately split. Six of the Crew, of whom I was one, having let down the Boat into the Sea, made a Shift*
            to get clear of the Ship, and the Rock. We rowed by my Computation, about three Leagues, till we were able
            to work no longer, being already spent with Labour while we were in the Ship. We therefore trusted ourselves
            to the Mercy of the Waves; and in about half an Hour the Boat was overset by a sudden Flurry from the North.
            What became of my Companions in the Boat, as well as of those who escaped on the Rock, or were left in the
            Vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they were all lost. For my own Part, I swam as Fortune directed me, and
            was pushed forward by Wind and Tide. I often let my Legs drop, and could feel no Bottom: But when I was</p>

        <p>almost gone, and able to struggle no longer, I found myself within my Depth; and by this Time the Storm was
            much abated. The Declivity was so small, that I walked near a Mile before I got to the Shore, which I
            conjectured was about Eight o&rsquo;Clock in the Evening. I then advanced forward near half a Mile, but
            could not discover any Sign of Houses or Inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a Condition, that I did not
            observe them. I was extremely tired, and with that, and the Heat of the Weather, and about half a Pint of
            Brandy that I drank as I left the Ship, I found my self much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the Grass,
            which was very short and soft; where I slept sounder than ever I remember to have done in my Life, and as I
            reckoned, above Nine Hours; for when I awaked,* it was just Day-light. I attempted to rise, but was not able
            to stir: For as I happened to lie on my Back, I found my Arms and Legs were strongly fastened on each Side
            to the Ground; and my Hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same Manner. I likewise felt several
            slender Ligatures across my Body, from my Armpits to my Thighs. I could only look upwards; the Sun began to
            grow hot, and the Light oﬀended mine Eyes. I heard a confused Noise about me, but in the Posture I lay,
            could see nothing except the Sky. In a little time I felt something alive moving on my left Leg, which
            advancing gently forward over my Breast, came almost up to my Chin; when bending mine Eyes downwards as much
            as I could, I perceived it to be a human Creature not six Inches high,* with a Bow and Arrow in his Hands,
            and a Quiver at his Back. In the mean time, I felt at least Forty more of the same Kind (as I conjectured)
            following the first. I was in the utmost Astonishment, and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a
            Fright; and some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the Falls they got by leaping from my
            Sides upon the Ground. However, they soon returned; and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full
            Sight of my Face, lifting up his Hands and Eyes by way of Admiration,* cryed out in a shrill, but distinct
            Voice, <em>Hekinah Degul</em>: The others repeated the same Words several times, but I then knew not what
            they meant. I lay all this while, as the Reader may believe, in great Uneasiness: At length, struggling to
            get loose, I had the Fortune to break the Strings, and wrench out the Pegs that fastened my left Arm to the
            Ground; for, by lifting it up to my Face, I discovered the Methods they had taken to bind me; and, at the
            same time, with a violent Pull, which gave me excessive Pain, I a little</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>loosened the Strings that tied down my Hair on the left Side; so that I was just able to turn my Head about
            two Inches. But the Creatures ran oﬀ a second time, before I could seize them; whereupon there was a great
            Shout in a very shrill Accent; and after it ceased, I heard one of them cry aloud, <em>Tolgo Phonac</em>;
            when in an Instant I felt above an Hundred Arrows discharged on my left Hand, which pricked me like so many
            Needles; and besides, they shot another Flight into the Air, as we do Bombs* in <em>Europe</em>; whereof
            many, I suppose, fell on my Body, (though I felt them not) and some on my Face, which I immediately covered
            with my left Hand. When this Shower of Arrows was over, I fell a groaning with Grief and Pain; and then
            striving again to get loose, they discharged another Volly larger than the first; and some of them attempted
            with Spears to stick me in the Sides; but, by good Luck, I had on me a Buﬀ Jerkin,* which they could not
            pierce. I thought it the most prudent Method to lie still; and my Design was to continue so till Night, when
            my left Hand being already loose, I could easily free myself: And as for the Inhabitants, I had Reason to
            believe I might be a Match for the greatest Armies they could bring against me, if they were all of the same
            Size with him that I saw. But Fortune disposed otherwise of me. When the People observed I was quiet, they
            discharged no more Arrows: But by the Noise increasing, I knew their Numbers were greater; and about four
            Yards from me, over-against my right Ear, I heard a Knocking for above an Hour, like People at work; when
            turning my Head that Way, as well as the Pegs and Strings would permit me, I saw a Stage erected about a
            Foot and a half from the Ground, capable of holding four of the Inhabitants, with two or three Ladders to
            mount it: From whence one of them, who seemed to be a Person of Quality, made me a long Speech, whereof I
            under-stood not one Syllable. But I should have mentioned, that before the principal Person began his
            Oration, he cryed out three times <em>Langro Dehul san</em>: (these Words and the former were afterwards
            repeated and explained to me.) Whereupon immediately about fifty of the Inhabitants came, and cut the
            Strings that fastened the left side of my Head, which gave me the Liberty of turning it to the right, and of
            observing the Person and Gesture of him who was to speak. He appeared to be of a middle Age, and taller than
            any of the other three who attended him; whereof one was a Page, who held up his Train, and seemed to be
            somewhat longer than my middle Finger; the other</p>

        <p>two stood one on each side to support him. He acted every part of an Orator; and I could observe many Periods
            of Threatnings, and others of Promises, Pity, and Kindness. I answered in a few Words, but in the most
            submissive Manner, lifting up my left Hand and both mine Eyes to the Sun, as calling him for a Witness; and
            being almost famished with Hunger, having not eaten a Morsel for some Hours before I left the Ship. I found
            the Demands of Nature so strong upon me, that I could not forbear shewing my Impatience (perhaps against the
            strict Rules of Decency) by putting my Finger frequently on my Mouth, to signify that I wanted Food. The
            <em>Hurgo</em> (for so they call a great Lord, as I afterwards learnt) understood me very well: He descended
            from the Stage, and commanded that several Ladders should be applied to my Sides, on which above an hundred
            of the Inhabitants mounted, and walked towards my Mouth, laden with Baskets full of Meat, which had been
            provided, and sent thither by the Kings&rsquo;s Orders upon the first Intelligence he received of me. I
            observed there was the Flesh of several Animals, but could not dis-tinguish them by the Taste. There were
            Shoulders, Legs, and Loins shaped like those of Mutton, and very well dressed, but smaller than the Wings of
            a Lark. I eat them by two or three at a Mouthful; and took three Loaves at a time, about the bigness of
            Musket Bullets. They supplyed me as fast as they could, shewing a thousand Marks of Wonder and Astonishment
            at my Bulk and Appetite. I then made another Sign that I wanted Drink. They found by my eating that a small
            Quantity would not suﬃce me; and being a most ingenious People, they slung up with great Dexterity one of
            their largest Hogsheads;* then rolled it towards my Hand, and beat out the Top; I drank it oﬀ at a Draught,
            which I might well do, for it hardly held half a Pint, and tasted like a small Wine of <em>Burgundy</em>,
            but much more delicious. They brought me a second Hogshead, which I drank in the same Manner, and made Signs
            for more, but they had none to give me. When I had performed these Wonders,* they shouted for Joy, and
            danced upon my Breast, repeating several times as they did at first, <em>Hekinah Degul</em>. They made me a
            Sign that I should throw down the two Hogsheads, but first warned the People below to stand out of the Way,
            crying aloud, <em>Borach Mivola</em>; and when they saw the Vessels in the Air, there was an universal Shout
            of <em>Hekinah Degul</em>. I confess I was often tempted, while they were passing backwards and forwards on
            my Body, to seize Forty or Fifty of the first that came in my</p>

        <p>Reach, and dash them against the Ground. But the Remembrance of what I had felt, which probably might not be
            the worst they could do; and the Promise of Honour I made them, for so I interpreted my submissive
            Behaviour, soon drove out those Imaginations. Besides, I now considered my self as bound by the Laws of
            Hospitality to a People who had treated me with so much Expence and Magnificence. However, in my Thoughts I
            could not suﬃciently wonder at the Intrepidity of these diminutive Mortals, who durst venture to mount and
            walk on my Body, while one of my Hands was at Liberty, without trembling at the very Sight of so prodigious
            a Creature as I must appear to them. After some time, when they observed that I made no more Demands for
            Meat, there appeared before me a Person of high Rank from his Imperial Majesty. His Excellency having
            mounted on the Small of my Right Leg, advanced forwards up to my Face, with about a Dozen of his Retinue;
            And producing his Credentials under the Signet Royal, which he applied close to mine Eyes, spoke about ten
            Minutes, without any Signs of Anger, but with a kind of determinate* Resolution; often pointing forwards,
            which, as I after-wards found was towards the Capital City, about half a Mile distant, whither it was agreed
            by his Majesty in Council that I must be con-veyed. I answered in few Words, but to no Purpose, and made a
            Sign with my Hand that was loose, putting it to the other, (but over his Excellency&rsquo;s Head, for Fear
            of hurting him or his Train) and then to my own Head and Body, to signify that I desired my Liberty. It
            appeared that he understood me well enough; for he shook his Head by way of Disapprobation, and held his
            Hand in a Posture to shew that I must be carried as a Prisoner. However, he made other Signs to let me
            understand that I should have Meat and Drink enough, and very good Treatment. Whereupon I once more thought
            of attempting to break my Bonds; but again, when I felt the Smart of their Arrows upon my Face and Hands,
            which were all in Blisters, and many of the Darts still sticking in them; and observing likewise that the
            Number of my Enemies encreased; I gave Tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased.
            Upon this, the <em>Hurgo</em> and his Train withdrew, with much Civility and chearful Countenances. Soon
            after I heard a general Shout, with frequent Repetitions of the Words, <em>Peplom Selan</em>, and I felt
            great Numbers of the People on my Left Side relaxing the Cords to such a Degree, that I was able to turn
            upon my Right, and to ease my self with making Water; which I very plentifully</p>

        <p>did, to the great Astonishment of the People, who conjecturing by my Motions what I was going to do,
            immediately opened to the right and left on that Side, to avoid the Torrent which fell with such Noise and
            Violence from me. But before this, they had dawbed my Face and both my Hands with a sort of Ointment very
            pleasant to the Smell, which in a few Minutes removed all the Smart of their Arrows. These Circumstances,
            added to the Refreshment I had received by their Victuals and Drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me
            to sleep. I slept about eight Hours as I was afterwards assured; and it was no Wonder; for the Physicians,
            by the Emperor&rsquo;s Order, had mingled a sleeping Potion in the Hogsheads of Wine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It seems that upon the first Moment I was discovered sleeping on the Ground after my Landing, the Emperor had
            early Notice of it by an Express;* and determined in Council that I should be tyed in the Manner I have
            related (which was done in the Night while I slept) that Plenty of Meat and Drink should be sent to me, and
            a Machine prepared to carry me to the Capital City.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am confident would not be imitated by any
            Prince in <em>Europe</em> on the like Occasion; however, in my Opinion it was extremely Prudent as well as
            Generous. For supposing these People had endeavoured to kill me with their Spears and Arrows while I was
            asleep; I should certainly have awaked with the first Sense of Smart, which might so far have rouzed my Rage
            and Strength, as to enable me to break the Strings wherewith I was tyed; after which, as they were not able
            to make Resistance, so they could expect no Mercy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These People are most excellent Mathematicians, and arrived to a great Perfection in Mechanicks by the
            Countenance and Encouragement of the Emperor, who is a renowned Patron of Learn-ing. This Prince hath
            several Machines fixed on Wheels, for the Carriage of Trees and other great Weights. He often buildeth his
            largest Men of War, whereof some are Nine Foot long, in the Woods where the Timber grows, and has them
            carried on these Engines* three or four Hundred Yards to the Sea. Five Hundred Carpenters and Engineers were
            immediately set at work to prepare the greatest Engine they had. It was a Frame of Wood raised three Inches
            from the Ground, about seven Foot long and four wide, moving upon twenty-two Wheels. The Shout I heard, was
            upon the Arrival of this Engine, which, it seems, set out in four Hours after my Landing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was brought parallel to me as I lay. But the principal Diﬃculty was to raise and place me in this Vehicle.
            Eighty Poles, each of one Foot high, were erected for this Purpose, and very strong Cords of the bigness of
            Packthread were fastened by Hooks to many Bandages, which the Workmen had girt round my Neck, my Hands, my
            Body, and my Legs. Nine Hundred of the strongest Men were employed to draw up these Cords by many Pullies
            fastned on the Poles; and thus in less than three Hours, I was raised and slung into the Engine, and there
            tyed fast. All this I was told; for while the whole Operation was performing, I lay in a profound Sleep, by
            the Force of that soporiferous Medicine infused into my Liquor. Fifteen hundred of the Emperor&rsquo;s
            largest Horses, each about four Inches and a half high, were employed to draw me towards the Metropolis,
            which, as I said, was half a Mile distant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About four Hours after we began our Journey, I awaked by a very ridiculous Accident; for the Carriage being
            stopt a while to adjust something that was out of Order, two or three of the young Natives had the Curiosity
            to see how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed up into the Engine, and advancing very softly to my
            Face, one of them, an Oﬃcer in the Guards, put the sharp End of his Half-Pike* a good way up into my left
            Nostril, which tickled my Nose like a Straw, and made me sneeze violently: Whereupon they stole oﬀ
            unperceived; and it was three Weeks before I knew the Cause of my awaking so suddenly. We made a long March
            the remaining Part of the Day, and rested at Night with Five Hundred Guards on each Side of me, half with
            Torches, and half with Bows and Arrows, ready to shoot me if I should oﬀer to stir. The next Morning at
            Sun-rise we continued our March, and arrived within two Hundred Yards of the City-Gates about Noon. The
            Emperor, and all his Court, came out to meet us; but his great Oﬃcers would by no means suﬀer his Majesty to
            endanger his Person by mounting on my Body.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At the Place where the Carriage stopt, there stood an ancient Temple, esteemed to be the largest in the whole
            Kingdom; which having been polluted some Years before by an unnatural Murder,* was, according to the Zeal of
            those People, looked upon as Prophane, and therefore had been applied to common Use, and all the Ornaments
            and Furniture carried away. In this Edifice it was deter-mined I should lodge. The great Gate fronting to
            the North was about four Foot high, and almost two Foot wide, through which I</p>

        <p>could easily creep. On each Side of the Gate was a small Window not above six Inches from the Ground: Into
            that on the Left Side, the King&rsquo;s Smiths conveyed fourscore and eleven Chains, like those that hang to
            a Lady&rsquo;s Watch in <em>Europe</em>, and almost as large, which were locked to my Left Leg with six and
            thirty Padlocks. Over against this Temple, on the other Side of the great Highway, at twenty Foot Distance,
            there was a Turret at least five Foot high. Here the Emperor ascended with many principal Lords of his
            Court, to have an Opportunity of viewing me, as I was told, for I could not see them. It was reckoned that
            above an hundred thousand Inhabitants came out of the Town upon the same Errand; and in spight of my Guards,
            I believe there could not be fewer than ten thousand, at several Times, who mounted upon my Body by the Help
            of Ladders. But a Proclamation was soon issued to forbid it, upon Pain of Death. When the Workmen found it
            was impossible for me to break loose, they cut all the Strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up with as
            melancholly a Disposition as ever I had in my Life. But the Noise and Astonishment of the People at seeing
            me rise and walk, are not to be expressed. The Chains that held my left Leg were about two Yards long, and
            gave me not only the Liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a Semicircle; but being fixed within four
            Inches of the Gate, allowed me to creep in, and lie at my full Length in the Temple.</p>

        <p>W h e n I found myself on my Feet, I looked about me, and must confess I never beheld a more entertaining
            Prospect. The Country round appeared like a continued Garden; and the inclosed Fields, which were generally
            Forty Foot square, resembled so many Beds of Flowers. These Fields were intermingled with Woods of half a
            Stang,* and the tallest Trees, as I could judge, appeared to be seven Foot high. I viewed the Town on my
            left Hand, which looked like the painted Scene of a City in a Theatre.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had been for some Hours extremely pressed by the Necessities of Nature; which was no Wonder, it being
            almost two Days since I had last disburthened myself. I was under great Diﬃculties between Urgency and
            Shame. The best Expedient I could think on, was to creep into my House, which I accordingly did; and
            shutting the Gate after me, I went as far as the Length of my Chain would suﬀer; and discharged my Body of
            that uneasy Load. But this was the only Time I was ever guilty of so uncleanly an Action; for which I cannot
            but hope the candid Reader will give some Allowance, after he hath maturely and impartially considered my
            Case, and the Distress I was in. From this Time my constant Practice was, as soon as I rose, to perform that
            Business in open Air, at the full Extent of my Chain; and due Care was taken every Morning before Company
            came, that the oﬀensive Matter should be carried oﬀ in Wheel-barrows, by two Servants appointed for that
            Purpose. I would not have dwelt so long upon a Circumstance, that perhaps at first Sight may appear not very
            momentous; if I had not thought it necessary to justify my Character in Point of Cleanliness to the World;
            which I am told, some of my Maligners* have been pleased, upon this and other Occasions, to call in
            Question.</p>

        <p>House, having Occasion for fresh Air. The Emperor was already descended from the Tower, and advancing on
            Horseback towards me, which had like to have cost* him dear; for the Beast, although very well trained, yet
            wholly unused to such a Sight, which appeared as if a Mountain moved before him, reared up on his hinder
            Feet: But that Prince, who is an excellent Horseman, kept his Seat, until his Attendants ran in, and held
            the Bridle, while his Majesty had Time to dismount. When he alighted, he surveyed me round with great
            Admiration, but kept beyond the Length of my Chains. He ordered his Cooks and Butlers, who were already
            prepared, to give me Victuals and Drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of Vehicles upon Wheels until I
            could reach them. I took those Vehicles, and soon emptied them all; twenty of them were filled with Meat,
            and ten with Liquor; each of the former aﬀorded me two or three good Mouthfuls, and I emptied the Liquor of
            ten Vessels, which was contained in earthen Vials, into one Vehicle, drinking it oﬀ at a Draught; and so I
            did with the rest. The Empress, and young Princes of the Blood,* of both Sexes, attended by many Ladies,
            sate at some Distance in their Chairs; but upon the Accident that happened to the Emperor&rsquo;s Horse,
            they alighted, and came near his Person; which I am now going to describe. He is taller* by almost the
            Breadth of my Nail, than any of his Court; which alone is enough to strike an Awe into the Beholders. His
            Features* are strong and masculine, with an <em>Austrian</em> Lip,* and arched Nose,* his Complexion olive,
            his Countenance* erect, his Body and Limbs well proportioned, all his Motions graceful, and his Deportment
            majestick. He was then past his Prime,* being twenty-eight Years and three Quarters old, of which he had
            reigned about seven,* in great Felicity, and generally victorious. For the better Convenience of beholding
            him, I lay on my Side, so that my Face was parallel to his, and he stood but three Yards oﬀ: However, I have
            had him since many Times in my Hand, and therefore cannot be deceived in the Description. His Dress was very
            plain and simple, the Fashion of it between the <em>Asiatick</em> and the <em>European</em>;* but he had on
            his Head a light Helmet of Gold, adorned with Jewels, and a Plume on the Crest. He held his Sword drawn in
            his Hand, to defend himself, if I should happen to break loose; it was almost three Inches long, the Hilt
            and Scabbard were Gold enriched with Diamonds. His Voice was shrill, but very clear and articulate, and I
            could distinctly hear it when I stood up. The Ladies and</p>

        <p>Courtiers were all most magnificently clad, so that the Spot they stood upon seemed to resemble a Petticoat
            spread on the Ground, embroidered with Figures of Gold and Silver. His Imperial Majesty spoke often to me,
            and I returned Answers, but neither of us could understand a Syllable. There were several of his Priests and
            Lawyers present (as I conjectured by their Habits) who were commanded to address themselves to me, and I
            spoke to them in as many Languages as I had the least Smattering of, which were <em>High</em> and <em>Low
                Dutch</em>,*<em> Latin</em>, <em>French</em>, <em>Spanish</em>, <em>Italian</em>, and <em>Lingua
                Franca</em>;* but all to no pur-pose. After about two Hours the Court retired, and I was left with a
            strong Guard, to prevent the Impertinence, and probably the Malice of the Rabble, who were very impatient to
            croud about me as near as they durst; and some of them had the Impudence to shoot their Arrows at me as I
            sate on the Ground by the Door of my House; whereof one very narrowly missed my left Eye. But the Colonel
            ordered six of the Ring-leaders to be seized, and thought no Pun-ishment so proper as to deliver them bound
            into my Hands, which some of his Soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forwards with the But-ends of their
            Pikes into my Reach: I took them all in my right Hand, put five of them into my Coat-pocket; and as to the
            sixth, I made a Countenance as if I would eat him alive. The poor Man squalled terribly, and the Colonel and
            his Oﬃcers were in much Pain, especially when they saw me take out my Penknife: But I soon put them out of
            Fear; for, looking mildly, and immedi-ately cutting the Strings he was bound with, I set him gently on the
            Ground, and away he ran. I treated the rest in the same Manner, taking them one by one out of my Pocket; and
            I observed, both the Soldiers and People were highly obliged at this Mark of my Clemency, which was
            represented very much to my Advantage at Court.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Towards Night I got with some Diﬃculty into my House, where I lay on the Ground, and continued to do so about
            a Fortnight; during which time the Emperor gave Orders to have a Bed prepared for me. Six Hundred Beds* of
            the common Measure were brought in Carriages, and worked up in my House; an Hundred and Fifty of their Beds
            sown together made up the Breadth and Length, and these were four double,* which however kept me but very
            indiﬀer-ently from the Hardness of the Floor, that was of smooth Stone. By the same Computation they
            provided me with Sheets, Blankets, and</p>

        <p>Coverlets, tolerable enough for one who had been so long enured to Hardships as I.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the News of my Arrival spread through the Kingdom, it brought prodigious Numbers of rich, idle, and
            curious People to see me; so that the Villages were almost emptied, and great Neglect of Tillage and
            Household Aﬀairs must have ensued, if his Imperial Majesty had not provided by several Proclamations and
            Orders of State against this Inconveniency. He directed that those, who had already beheld me, should return
            home, and not presume to come within fifty Yards of my House, without Licence from Court; whereby the
            Secretaries of State got considerable Fees.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the mean time, the Emperor held frequent Councils to debate what Course should be taken with me; and I was
            afterwards assured by a particular Friend, a Person of great Quality, who was as much in the <em>Secret</em>
            as any; that the Court was under many Diﬃculties con-cerning me. They apprehended my breaking loose; that my
            Diet would he very expensive, and might cause a Famine. Sometimes they determined to starve me, or at least
            to shoot me in the Face and Hands with poisoned Arrows, which would soon dispatch me: But again they
            considered, that the Stench of so large a Carcase might produce a Plague in the Metropolis, and probably
            spread through the whole Kingdom. In the midst of these Consultations, several Oﬃcers of the Army went to
            the Door of the great Council-Chamber; and two of them being admitted, gave an Account of my Behaviour to
            the six Criminals above-mentioned; which made so favourable an Impression in the Breast of his Majesty, and
            the whole Board, in my Behalf, that an Imperial Commission was issued out, obliging all the Villages nine
            hundred Yards round the City to deliver in every Morning six Beeves,* forty Sheep, and other Victuals for my
            Sustenance; together with a proportionable Quantity of Bread and Wine, and other Liquors: For the due
            Payment of which his Majesty gave Assignments upon his Treasury. For this Prince lives chiefly upon his own
            Demesnes;* seldom, except upon great Occasions rais-ing any Subsidies* upon his Subjects, who are bound to
            attend him in his Wars at their own Expence. An Establishment was also made of Six Hundred Persons to be my
            Domesticks, who had Board-Wages allowed for their Maintenance, and Tents built for them very con-veniently
            on each side of my Door. It was likewise ordered, that three hundred Taylors should make me a Suit of
            Cloaths after the</p>

        <p>Fashion of the Country: That, six of his Majesty&rsquo;s greatest Scholars should be employed to instruct me
            in their Language: And, lastly, that the Emperor&rsquo;s Horses, and those of the Nobility, and Troops of
            Guards, should be exercised in my Sight, to accustom themselves to me. All these Orders were duly put in
            Execution; and in about three Weeks I made a great Progress in Learning their Language; during which Time,
            the Emperor frequently honoured me with his Visits, and was pleased to assist my Masters in teaching me. We
            began already to converse together in some Sort; and the first Words I learnt, were to express my Desire,
            that he would please to give me my Liberty; which I every Day repeated on my Knees. His Answer, as I could
            apprehend, was, that this must be a Work of Time, not to be thought on without the Advice of his Council;
            and that first I must <em>Lumos Kelmin pesso desmar lon Emposo</em>; that is, <em>Swear a Peace with him and
                his Kingdom</em>. However, that I should be used with all Kindness; and he advised me to acquire by my
            Patience and discreet Behaviour, the Good opinion of himself and his Subjects. He desired I would not take
            it ill, if he gave Orders to certain proper Oﬃcers to search me; for probably I might carry about me several
            Weapons,* which must needs be dangerous Things, if they answered the Bulk of so prodigious a Person. I said,
            his Majesty should be satisfied, for I was ready to strip my self, turn up my Pockets before him. This I
            delivered, part in Words and part in Signs. He replied, that by the Laws of the Kingdom, I must be searched
            by two of his Oﬃcers: That he knew this could not be done without my Consent and Assistance; that he had so
            good an Opinion of my Generosity and Justice, as to trust their Persons in my Hands: That whatever they took
            from me should be returned when I left the Country, or paid for at the Rate which I would set upon them. I
            took up the two Oﬃcers in my Hands, put them first into my Coat-Pockets, and then into every other Pocket
            about me, except my two Fobs, and another secret Pocket which I had no Mind should be searched, wherein I
            had some little Necessaries of no Consequence to any but my self. In one of my Fobs there was a Silver
            Watch, and in the other a small Quantity of Gold in a Purse. These Gentlemen, having Pen, Ink, and Paper
            about them, made an exact Inventory of every thing they saw, and when they had done, desired I would set
            them down, that they might deliver it to the Emperor. This Inventory I afterwards trans-lated into
            <em>English</em>, and is Word for Word as follows.</p>

        <p>IMPRIMIS,* In the right Coat-Pocket of the <em>Great Man Mountain</em> (for so I interpret the Words
            <em>Quinbus Flestrin</em>) after the strictest Search, we found only one great Piece of coarse Cloth, large
            enough to be a Foot-Cloth* for your Majesty&rsquo;s chief Room of State. In the left Pocket, we saw a huge
            Silver Chest, with a Cover of the same Metal, which we, the Searchers, were not able to lift. We desired it
            should be opened; and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid Leg in a sort of Dust, some
            part whereof flying up to our Faces, set us both a sneezing for several Times together. In his right
            Waistcoat-Pocket, we found a prodigious Bundle of thin white Substances, folded one above another, about the
            Bigness of three Men, tied with a strong Cable, and marked with Black Figures; which we humbly conceive to
            be Writings, every Letter almost half as large as the Palm of our Hands. In the left there was a sort of
            Engine, from the Back of which were extended twenty long Poles, resembling the Pallisado&rsquo;s before your
            Majesty&rsquo;s Court; wherewith we conjecture the <em>Man Mountain</em> combs his Head; for we did not
            always trouble him with Questions, because we found it a great Diﬃculty to make him understand us. In the
            large Pocket on the right Side of his middle Cover, (so I translate the word <em>Ranfu-Lo</em>, by which
            they meant my Breeches) we saw a hollow Pillar of Iron, about the Length of a Man, fastened to a strong
            Piece of Timber, larger than the Pillar; and upon one side of the Pillar were huge Pieces of Iron sticking
            out, cut into strange Figures; which we know not what to make of. In the left Pocket, another Engine of the
            same kind. In the smaller Pocket on the right Side, were several round flat Pieces of white and red Metal,*
            of diﬀerent Bulk: Some of the white, which seemed to be Silver, were so large and heavy, that my Com-rade
            and I could hardly lift them. In the left Pocket were two black Pillars irregularly shaped: we could not,
            without Diﬃculty, reach the Top of them as we stood at the Bottom of his Pocket: One of them was covered,
            and seemed all of a Piece; but at the upper End of the other, there appeared a white round Substance, about
            twice the big-ness of our Heads. Within each of these was inclosed a prodigious Plate of Steel; which, by
            our Orders, we obliged him to shew us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous Engines. He took them
            out of their Cases, and told us, that in his own Country his Practice was to shave his Beard with one of
            these, and to cut his Meat with the other. There were two Pockets which we could not enter:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These he called his Fobs; they were two large Slits cut into the Top of his middle Cover, but squeezed close
            by the pressure of his Belly. Out of the right Fob hung a great Silver Chain, with a wonderful kind of
            Engine at the Bottom. We directed him to draw out whatever was at the End of that Chain; which appeared to
            be a Globe, half Silver, and half of some transparent Metal: for on the transparent Side we saw certain
            strange Figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch them, until we found our Fingers stopped with
            that lucid Substance. He put this Engine to our Ears, which made an incessant Noise like that of a
            Water-Mill. And we conjecture it is either some unknown Animal, or the God that he worships: But we are more
            inclined to the latter Opinion, because he assured us (if we understood him right, for he expressed himself
            very imperfectly) that he seldom did any Thing without consulting it. He called it his Oracle, and said it
            pointed out the Time for every Action of his Life. From the left Fob he took out a Net almost large enough
            for a Fisherman, but contrived to open and shut like a Purse, and served him for the same Use: We found
            therein several massy Pieces of yellow Metal, which if they be real Gold, must be of immense Value.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>H av i n g thus, in Obedience to your Majesty&rsquo;s Commands, dili-gently searched all his Pockets; we
            observed a Girdle about his Waist made of the Hyde of some prodigious Animal; from which, on the left Side,
            hung a Sword of the Length of five Men; and on the right, a Bag or Pouch divided into two Cells; each Cell
            capable of holding three of your Majesty&rsquo;s Subjects. In one of these Cells were several Globes or
            Balls of a most ponderous Metal, about the Bigness of our Heads, and required a strong Hand to lift them:
            The other Cell con-tained a Heap of certain black Grains, but of no great Bulk or Weight, for we could hold
            above fifty of them in the Palms of our Hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h i s is an exact Inventory of what we found about the Body of the <em>Man Mountain</em>; who used us with
            great Civility, and due Respect to your Majesty&rsquo;s Commission. Signed and Sealed on the fourth Day of
            the eighty ninth Moon of your Majesty&rsquo;s auspicious Reign.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When this Inventory was read over to the Emperor, he directed me to deliver up the several Particulars. He
            first called for my Scymiter, which I took out, Scabbard and all. In the mean time he ordered three thousand
            of his choicest Troops, who then attended</p>

        <p>him, to surround me at a Distance, with their Bows and Arrows just ready to discharge: But I did not observe
            it; for mine Eyes were wholly fixed upon his Majesty. He then desired me to draw my Scymiter, which,
            although it had got some Rust by the Sea-Water, was in most Parts exceeding bright. I did so, and
            immediately all the Troops gave a Shout between Terror and Surprize; for the Sun shone clear, and the
            Reflexion dazzled their Eyes, as I waved the Scymiter to and fro in my Hand. His Majesty, who is a most
            mag-nanimous Prince, was less daunted than I could expect; he ordered me to return it into the Scabbard, and
            cast it on the Ground as gently as I could, about six Foot from the End of my Chain. The next Thing he
            demanded was one of the hollow Iron Pillars, by which he meant my Pocket-Pistols. I drew it out, and at his
            Desire, as well as I could, expressed to him the Use of it, and charging it only with Powder, which by the
            Closeness* of my Pouch, happened to escape wetting in the Sea, (an Inconvenience that all prudent Mariners
            take special Care to provide against) I first cautioned the Emperor not to be afraid; and then I let it oﬀ
            in the Air. The Astonishment here was much greater than at the Sight of my Scymiter. Hundreds fell down as
            if they had been struck dead; and even the Emperor, although he stood his Ground, could not recover himself
            in some time. I delivered up both my Pistols in the same Manner as I had done my Scymiter, and then my Pouch
            of Powder and Bullets; begging him that the former might be kept from Fire; for it would kindle with the
            smallest Spark, and blow up his Imperial Palace into the Air. I like-wise delivered up my Watch, which the
            Emperor was very curious to see; and commanded two of his tallest Yeomen of the Guards to bear it on a Pole
            upon their Shoulders, as Dray-men in <em>England</em> do a Barrel of Ale. He was amazed at the continual
            Noise it made, and the Motion of the Minute-hand, which he could easily discern; for their Sight is much
            more acute than ours: He asked the Opinions of his learned Men about him, which were various and remote, as
            the Reader may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could not very perfectly understand
            them. I then gave up my Silver and Copper Money, my Purse with nine large Pieces of Gold, and some smaller
            ones; my Knife and Razor, my Comb and Silver Snuﬀ-Box, my Handkerchief and Journal Book. My Scymiter,
            Pistols, and Pouch, were conveyed in Carriages to his Majesty&rsquo;s Stores; but the rest of my Goods were
            returned me.</p>

        <p>I had, as I before observed, one private Pocket which escaped their Search, wherein there was a Pair of
            Spectacles (which I sometimes use for the Weakness of mine Eyes), a Pocket Perspective,* and several other
            little Conveniences; which being of no Consequence to the Emperor, I did not think my self bound in Honour
            to discover; and I apprehended they might be lost or spoiled if I ventured them out of my Possession.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>CHAPTER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THREE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>The Author diverts the Emperor and his Nobility of both Sexes, in a very uncommon Manner. The Diversions
                of the Court of</em> Lilliput <em>described. The Author hath his Liberty granted him upon certain
                Conditions.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>M y gentleness and good Behaviour had gained so far on the Emperor and his Court, and indeed upon the Army
            and People in general, that I began to conceive Hopes of getting my Liberty in a short Time. I took all
            possible Methods to cultivate this favourable Disposition. The Natives came by Degrees to be less
            apprehensive of any Danger from me. I would sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my
            Hand. And at last the Boys and Girls would venture to come and play at Hide and Seek in my Hair. I had now
            made a good Progress in understanding and speaking their Language. The Emperor had a mind one Day to
            entertain me with several of the Country Shows; wherein they exceed all Nations I have known, both for
            Dexterity and Magnificence. I was diverted with none so much as that of the Rope-Dancers,* performed upon a
            slender white Thread, extended about two Foot, and twelve Inches from the Ground. Upon which, I shall desire
            Liberty, with the Reader&rsquo;s Patience, to enlarge a little.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Diversion is only practised by those Persons, who are Candidates for great Employments, and high Favour,
            at Court. They are trained in this Art from their Youth, and are not always of noble Birth, or liberal
            Education. When a great Oﬃce is vacant, either by Death or Disgrace, (which often happens) five or six of
            those Candidates petition the Emperor to entertain his Majesty and the Court with a Dance on the Rope; and
            whoever jumps the highest without falling, succeeds in the Oﬃce. Very often the chief Ministers themselves
            are commanded to shew their Skill, and to convince the Emperor that they have not lost their Faculty.
            <em>Flimnap</em>,* the Treasurer, is allowed to cut a Caper on the strait Rope, at least an Inch higher than
            any other Lord in the whole Empire. I have seen him do the Summerset* several times together, upon a
            Trencher fixed on the Rope, which is no thicker than a common Packthread in <em>England</em>. My Friend

        <p>Aﬀairs, is, in my Opinion, if I am not partial, the second after the Treasurer; the rest of the great Oﬃcers
            are much upon a Par.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These Diversions are often attended with fatal Accidents, whereof great Numbers are on Record. I my self have
            seen two or three Candidates break a Limb. But the Danger is much greater, when the Ministers themselves are
            commanded to shew their Dexterity: For, by contending to excel themselves and their Fellows, they strain so
            far, that there is hardly one of them who hath not received a Fall; and some of them two or three. I was
            assured, that a Year or two before my Arrival, <em>Flimnap</em> would have infallibly broke his Neck, if one
            of the <em>King&rsquo;s Cushions</em>,* that accidentally lay on the Ground, had not weakened the Force of
            his Fall.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There is likewise another Diversion, which is only shewn before the Emperor and Empress, and first Minister,
            upon particular Occa-sions. The Emperor lays on a Table three fine silken Threads* of six Inches long. One
            is Blue, the other Red, and the third Green. These Threads are proposed as Prizes, for those Persons whom
            the Emperor hath a mind to distinguish by a peculiar Mark of his Favour. The Ceremony is performed in his
            Majesty&rsquo;s great Chamber of State; where the Candidates are to undergo a Tryal of Dexterity very
            diﬀerent from the former; and such as I have not observed the least Resemblance of in any other Country of
            the old or the new World. The Emperor holds a Stick in his Hands, both ends parallel to the Horizon, while
            the Candidates advancing one by one, some-times leap over the Stick, sometimes creep under it backwards and
            forwards several times, according as the Stick is advanced or depressed. Sometimes the Emperor holds one End
            of the Stick, and his first Minister the other; sometimes the Minister has it entirely to himself. Whoever
            performs his Part with most Agility, and holds out the longest in <em>leaping</em> and <em>creeping</em>, is
            rewarded with the Blue-coloured Silk; the Red is given to the next, and the Green to the third, which they
            all wear girt round about the Middle; and you see few great Persons about this Court, who are not adorned
            with one of these Girdles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Horses of the Army, and those of the Royal Stables, having been daily led before me, were no longer shy,
            but would come up to my very Feet, without starting. The Riders would leap them over my Hand as I held it on
            the Ground; and one of the Emperor&rsquo;s Huntsmen, upon a large Courser, took my Foot, Shoe and all; which

        <p>was indeed a prodigious Leap. I had the good Fortune to divert the Emperor one Day, after a very
            extraordinary Manner. I desired he would order several Sticks of two Foot high, and the Thickness of an
            ordinary Cane, to be brought me; whereupon his Majesty com-manded the Master of his Woods to give Directions
            accordingly; and the next Morning six Wood-men arrived with as many Carriages, drawn by eight Horses to
            each. I took nine of these Sticks, and fixing them firmly in the ground in a Quadrangular Figure, two Foot
            and a half square; I took four other Sticks, and tyed them parallel at each Corner, about two Foot from the
            Ground; then I fastened my Handkerchief to the nine Sticks that stood erect; and extended it on all Sides,
            till it was as tight as the Top of a Drum; and the four parallel Sticks rising about five Inches higher than
            the Handkerchief, served as Ledges on each Side. When I had finished my Work, I desired the Emperor to let a
            Troop of his best Horse, Twenty-four in Number, come and exercise upon this Plain. His Majesty approved of
            the Proposal, and I took them up one by one in my Hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper Oﬃcers to
            exercise them. As soon as they got into Order, they divided into two Parties, performed mock Skirmishes,
            discharged blunt Arrows, drew their Swords, fled and pursued, attacked and retired; and in short discovered*
            the best military Discipline I ever beheld. The parallel Sticks secured them and their Horses from falling
            over the Stage; and the Emperor was so much delighted, that he ordered this Entertainment to be repeated
            several Days; and once was pleased to be lifted up, and give the Word of Command; and, with great Diﬃculty,
            persuaded even the Empress her self to let me hold her in her close Chair,* within two Yards of the Stage,
            from whence she was able to take a full View of the whole Performance. It was my good Fortune that no ill
            Accident happened in these Entertainments; only once a fiery Horse that belonged to one of the Captains,
            pawing with his Hoof struck a Hole in my Handkerchief, and his Foot slipping, he over-threw his Rider and
            himself; but I immediately relieved them both: For covering the Hole with one Hand, I set down the Troop
            with the other, in the same Manner as I took them up. The Horse that fell was strained in the left Shoulder,
            but the Rider got no Hurt; and I repaired my Handkerchief as well as I could: However, I would not trust to
            the Strength of it any more in such dangerous Enterprizes.</p>

            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About two or three Days before I was set at Liberty, as I was entertaining the Court with these Kinds of
            Feats, there arrived an Express to inform his Majesty, that some of his Subjects riding near the Place where
            I was first taken up, had seen a great black Substance lying on the Ground, very oddly shaped, extending its
            Edges round as wide as his Majesty&rsquo;s Bedchamber, and rising up in the Middle as high as a Man: That it
            was no living Creature, as they at first appre-hended; for it lay on the Grass without Motion; and some of
            them had walked round it several Times: That by mounting upon each others Shoulders, they had got to the
            Top, which was flat and even; and, stamping upon it, they found it was hollow within: That they humbly
            conceived it might be something belonging to the <em>Man-Mountain</em>; and if his Majesty pleased, they
            would undertake to bring it with only five Horses. I presently knew what they meant; and was glad at Heart
            to receive this Intelligence. It seems, upon my first reaching the Shore, after our Shipwreck, I was in such
            Confu-sion, that before I came to the Place where I went to sleep, my Hat, which I had fastened with a
            String to my Head while I was rowing, and had stuck on all the Time I was swimming, fell oﬀ after I came to
            Land; the String, as I conjecture, breaking by some Accident which I never observed, but thought my Hat had
            been lost at Sea. I intreated his Imperial Majesty to give Orders it might be brought to me as soon as
            possible, describing to him the Use and the Nature of it: And the next Day the Waggoners arrived with it,
            but not in a very good Condition; they had bored two Holes in the Brim, within an Inch and a half of the
            Edge, and fastened two Hooks in the Holes; these Hooks were tied by a long Cord to the Harness, and thus my
            Hat was dragged along for above half an <em>English</em> Mile: But the Ground in that Country being
            extremely smooth and level, it received less Damage than I expected.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Two Days after this Adventure, the Emperor having ordered that Part of his Army, which quarters in and about
            his Metropolis,* to be in a Readiness, took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular Manner. He
            desired I would stand like a <em>Colossus</em>,* with my Legs as far asunder as I conveniently could. He
            then commanded his General (who was an old experienced Leader, and a great Patron of mine) to draw up the
            Troops in close Order, and march them under me; the Foot by Twenty-four in a Breast,* and the Horse by
            Sixteen, with Drums beating, Colours flying, and Pikes advanced. This Body</p>

        <p>consisted of three Thousand Foot, and a Thousand Horse. His Majesty gave Orders, upon Pain of Death, that
            every Soldier in his March should observe the strictest Decency, with regard to my Per-son; which, however,
            could not prevent some of the younger Oﬃcers from turning up their Eyes as they passed under me. And, to
            confess the Truth, my Breeches were at that Time in so ill a Condition, that they aﬀorded some Opportunities
            for Laughter and Admiration.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had sent so many Memorials and Petitions for my Liberty, that his Majesty at length mentioned the Matter
            first in the Cabinet, and then in a full Council; where it was opposed by none, except <em>Skyresh
                Bolgolam</em>,* who was pleased, without any Provocation, to be my mortal Enemy. But it was carried
            against him by the whole Board, and confirmed by the Emperor. That Minister was <em>Galbet</em>, or Admiral
            of the Realm; very much in his Master&rsquo;s Confidence, and a Person well versed in Aﬀairs, but of a
            morose and sour Complection. However, he was at length persuaded to comply; but prevailed that the Articles
            and Conditions upon which I should be set free, and to which I must swear, should be drawn up by himself.
            These Articles were brought to me by <em>Skyresh Bolgolam</em> in Person, attended by two under Secretaries,
            and several Persons of Distinction. After they were read, I was demanded to swear to the Performance of
            them; first in the Manner of my own Country, and afterwards in the Method prescribed by their Laws; which
            was to hold my right Foot in my left Hand, to place the middle Finger of my right Hand on the Crown of my
            Head, and my Thumb on the Tip of my right Ear. But, because the Reader may perhaps be curious to have some
            Idea of the Style and Manner of Expression peculiar to that People, as well as to know the Articles upon
            which I recovered my Liberty; I have made a Translation of the whole Instrument, Word for Word, as near as I
            was able; which I here oﬀer to the Publick.</p>

        <p>s i x t h ly , He shall be our Ally against our Enemies in the Island of <em>Blefuscu</em>, and do his utmost

        <p>la s t ly , That upon his solemn Oath to observe all the above Articles, the said <em>Man-Mountain</em> shall

            Acknowledgments, by prostrating myself at his Majesty&rsquo;s Feet: But he commanded me to rise; and after
            many gracious Expressions, which, to avoid the Censure of Vanity, I shall not repeat; he added, that he
            hoped I should prove a useful Servant, and well deserve all the Favours he had already conferred upon me, or

            Some time after, asking a Friend at Court how they came to fix on that determinate Number; he told me, that
            his Majesty&rsquo;s Mathematicians, having taken the Height of my Body by the Help of a Quadrant, and
            finding it to exceed theirs in the Propor-tion of Twelve to One, they concluded from the Similarity of their
            Bodies, that mine must contain at least 1728 of theirs, and con-sequently would require as much Food as was
            necessary to support that Number of <em>Lilliputians</em>. By which, the Reader may conceive an Idea of the
            Ingenuity of that People, as well as the prudent and exact Oeconomy* of so great a Prince.</p>

                that Empire: The Author&rsquo;s O</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>ers to serve the Emperor in his Wars.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h e first Request I made after I had obtained my Liberty, was, that I might have Licence to see
            <em>Mildendo</em>, the Metropolis; which the Emperor easily granted me, but with a special Charge to do no
            Hurt, either to the Inhabitants, or their houses. The People had Notice by Proclamation of my Design to
            visit the Town. The Wall which encompassed it, is two Foot and a half high, and at least eleven Inches
            broad, so that a Coach and Horses may be driven very safely round it; and it is flanked with strong Towers
            at ten Foot Distance. I stept over the great <em>Western</em> Gate, and passed very gently, and side-ling
            through the two principal Streets, only in my short Waistcoat, for fear of damaging the Roofs and Eves of
            the Houses with the Skirts of my Coat. I walked with the utmost Circumspection, to avoid treading on any
            Stragglers, who might remain in the Streets, although the Orders were very strict, that all People should
            keep in their Houses, at their own Peril. The Garret Windows and Tops of Houses were so crowded with
            Spectators, that I thought in all my Travels I had not seen a more populous Place. The City is an exact
            Square, each Side of the Wall being five Hundred Foot long. The two great Streets which run cross and divide
            it into four Quarters, are five Foot wide. The Lanes and Alleys which I could not enter, but only viewed
            them as I passed, are from Twelve to Eighteen Inches. The Town is capable of holding five Hundred Thousand
            Souls. The Houses are from three to five Stories. The Shops and Markets well provided.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Emperor&rsquo;s Palace is in the Center of the City, where the two great Streets meet. It is inclosed by
            a Wall of two Foot high, and Twenty Foot distant from the Buildings. I had his Majesty&rsquo;s Permis-sion
            to step over this Wall; and the Space being so wide between that and the Palace, I could easily view it on
            every Side. The outward Court is a Square of Forty Foot, and includes two other Courts: In</p>

        <p>the inmost are the Royal Apartments, which I was very desirous to see, but found it extremely diﬃcult; for
            the great Gates, from one Square into another, were but Eighteen Inches high, and seven Inches wide. Now the
            Buildings of the outer Court were at least five Foot high; and it was impossible for me to stride over them,
            without infinite Damage to the Pile, although the Walls were strongly built of hewn Stone, and four Inches
            thick. At the same time, the Emperor had a great Desire that I should see the Magnificence of his Palace:
            But this I was not able to do till three Days after, which I spent in cutting down with my Knife some of the
            largest Trees in the Royal Park, about an Hundred Yards distant from the City. Of these Trees I made two
            Stools, each about three Foot high, and strong enough to bear my Weight. The People having received Notice a
            second time, I went again through the City to the Palace, with my two Stools in my Hands. When I came to the
            Side of the outer Court, I stood upon one Stool, and took the other in my Hand: This I lifted over the Roof,
            and gently set it down on the Space between the first and second Court, which was eight Foot wide. I then
            stept over the Buildings very conveniently from one Stool to the other, and drew up the first after me with
            a hooked Stick. By this Contrivance I got into the inmost Court; and lying down upon my Side, I applied my
            Face to the Windows of the middle Stories, which were left open on Purpose, and discovered the most splendid
            Apartments that can be imagined. There I saw the Empress, and the young Princes in their several Lodgings,
            with their chief Attendants about them. Her Imperial Majesty was pleased to smile very graciously upon me,
            and gave me out of the Window her Hand to kiss.</p>

        <p>But I shall not anticipate the Reader with farther Descriptions of this Kind, because I reserve them for a
            greater Work, which is now almost ready for the Press; containing a general Description of this Empire, from
            its first Erection, through a long Series of Princes, with a particular Account of their Wars and Politicks,
            Laws, Learning, and Religion; their Plants and Animals, their peculiar Manners and Customs, with other
            Matters very curious and useful; my chief Design at present being only to relate such Events and
            Transactions as happened to the Publick, or to my self, during a Residence of about nine Months in that
            Empire.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Reldresal</em>, Principal Secretary (as they style him) of private Aﬀairs, came to my House, attended
            only by one Servant. He ordered his Coach to wait at a Distance, and desired I would give him an
            Hour&rsquo;s Audience; which I readily consented to, on Account of his Quality, and Personal Merits, as well
            of the many good Oﬃces he had done me during my Sollicitations at Court. I oﬀered to lie down, that he might
            the more conveniently reach my Ear; but he chose rather to let me hold him in my Hand during our
            Conversation. He began with Compliments on my Liberty; said, he might pretend to some Merit in it;* but,
            however, added, that if it had not been for the present Situation of things at Court, perhaps I might not
            have obtained it so soon. For, <em>said he</em>, as flourishing a Condition as we appear to be in to
            Foreigners, we labour under two mighty Evils; a violent Faction at home, and the Danger of an Invasion by a
            most potent Enemy from abroad. As to the first, you are to understand, that for above seventy Moons past,
            there have been two struggling Parties in this Empire, under the Names of <em>Tramecksan</em>, and
            <em>Slamecksan</em>,* from the high and low Heels on their Shoes, by which they dis-tinguish themselves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is alledged indeed, that the high Heels are most agreeable to our ancient Constitution: But however this
            be, his Majesty hath deter-mined to make use of only low Heels in the Administration* of the Government, and
            all Oﬃces in the Gift of the Crown; as you cannot but observe; and particularly, that his Majesty&rsquo;s
            Imperial Heels are lower at least by a <em>Drurr</em> than any of his Court; (<em>Drurr</em> is a Measure
            about the fourteenth Part of an Inch.) The Animosities* between these two Parties run so high, that they
            will neither eat nor drink, nor talk with each other. We compute the <em>Tramecksan</em>, or High-Heels, to
            exceed us in Number; but the Power is wholly on our Side. We apprehend his Imperial Highness, the Heir to
            the Crown, to have some Tendency towards the High-Heels;* at least we can plainly discover one of his Heels
            higher than the other; which gives him a Hobble in his Gait. Now, in the midst of these intestine Disquiets,
            we are threatened with an Invasion from the Island of <em>Blefuscu</em>, which is the other great Empire of
            the Universe, almost as large and powerful as this of his Majesty. For as to what we have heard you aﬃrm,
            that there are other Kingdoms and States in the World, inhabited by human Creatures as large as your self,
            our Philosophers are in much Doubt; and would rather conjecture that you dropt from</p>

        <p>the Moon, or one of the Stars; because it is certain, than an hundred Mortals of your Bulk, would, in a short
            Time, destroy all the Fruits and Cattle of his Majesty&rsquo;s Dominions. Besides, our Histories of six
            Thousand Moons make no Mention of any other Regions, than the two great Empires of <em>Lilliput</em> and
            <em>Blefuscu</em>. Which two mighty Powers have, as I was going to tell you, been engaged in a most
            obstinate War for six and thirty Moons* past. It began upon the following Occasion. It is allowed on all
            Hands, that the primitive Way of breaking Eggs before we eat them, was upon the larger End: But his present
            Majesty&rsquo;s Grand-father, while he was a Boy, going to eat an Egg, and breaking it according to the
            ancient Practice, hap-pened to cut one of his Fingers. Whereupon the Emperor, his Father, published an
            Edict, commanding all his Subjects, upon great Penalties, to break the smaller End of their Eggs. The People
            so highly resented this Law, that our Histories tell us, there have been six Rebellions raised on that
            Account; wherein one Emperor lost his Life, and another his Crown.* These civil Commotions were con-stantly
            fomented by the Monarchs of <em>Blefuscu</em>; and when they were quelled, the Exiles always fled for Refuge
            to that Empire.* It is computed, that eleven Thousand Persons have, at several Times, suﬀered Death, rather
            than submit to break their Eggs at the smaller End. Many hundred large Volumes have been published upon this
            Controversy: But the Books of the <em>Big-Endians</em> have been long for-bidden, and the whole Party
            rendred incapable by Law* of holding Employments. During the Course of these Troubles, the Emperors of
            <em>Blefuscu</em> did frequently expostulate by their Ambassadors, accusing us of making a Schism in
            Religion, by oﬀending against a fundamental Doctrine of our great Prophet <em>Lustrog</em>, in the
            fifty-fourth Chapter of the <em>Brundrecal</em>, (which is their <em>Alcoran</em>*). This, however, is
            thought to be a meer Strain upon the Text: For the Words are these; <em>That all true Believers shall break
                their Eggs at the convenient End</em>: and which is the convenient End, seems, in my humble Opinion, to
            be left to every Man&rsquo;s Conscience, or at least in the Power of the chief Magis-trate* to determine.
            Now the <em>Big-Endian</em> Exiles have found so much Credit in the Emperor of <em>Blefuscu&rsquo;s</em>
            Court; and so much private Assistance and Encouragement from their Party here at home, that a bloody War
            hath been carried on between the two Empires for six and thirty Moons with various Success; during which
            Time we have lost Forty Capital Ships, and a much greater Number of smaller</p>

        <p>Vessels, together with thirty thousand of our best Seamen and Soldiers; and the Damage received by the Enemy
            is reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours. However, they have now equipped a numerous Fleet, and are just
            preparing to make a Descent upon us: And his Imperial Majesty, placing great Confidence in your Valour and
            Strength, hath commanded me to lay this Account of his Aﬀairs before you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I desired the Secretary to present my humble Duty to the Emperor, and to let him know, that I thought it
            would not become me, who was a Foreigner, to interfere with Parties; but I was ready, with the Hazard of my
            Life, to defend his Person and State against all Invaders.</p>

                him. Ambassadors arrive from the Emperor of</em> Blefuscu <em>and sue for Peace. The Empress&rsquo;s

                of the Palace.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h e Empire of <em>Blefuscu</em>, is an Island situated to the North North-East Side of <em>Lilliput</em>,
            from whence it is parted only by a Channel of eight Hundred Yards wide. I had not yet seen it, and upon this
            Notice of an intended Invasion, I avoided appearing on that Side of the Coast, for fear of being discovered
            by some of the Enemies Ships, who had received no Intelligence of me; all intercourse between the two
            Empires having been strictly forbidden during the War, upon Pain of Death; and an Embargo laid by our
            Emperor upon all Vessels whatsoever. I communicated to his Majesty a Project I had formed of seizing the
            Enemies whole Fleet; which, as our Scouts assured us, lay at Anchor in the Harbour ready to sail with the
            first fair Wind. I consulted the most experienced Seamen, upon the Depth of the Channel, which they had
            often plummed; who told me, that in the Middle at high Water it was seventy
            <em>Glumglu</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>s</em> deep, which is about six Foot of <em>European</em> Measure; and the
            rest of it fifty <em>Glumglu</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>s</em> at most. I walked to the North-East Coast over
            against<em> Blefuscu</em>; where, lying down behind a Hillock, I took out my small Pocket Perspective Glass,
            and viewed the Enemy&rsquo;s Fleet at Anchor, consisting of about fifty Men of War, and a great Number of
            Trans-ports: I then came back to my House, and gave Order (for which I had a Warrant) for a great Quantity
            of the strongest Cable and Bars of Iron. The Cable was about as thick as Packthread, and the Bars of the
            Length and Size of a Knitting-Needle. I trebled the Cable to make it stronger; and for the same Reason I
            twisted three of the Iron Bars together, bending the Extremities into a Hook. Having thus fixed fifty Hooks
            to as many Cables, I went back to the North-East Coast, and putting oﬀ my Coat, Shoes, and Stockings, walked
            into the Sea in my Leathern Jerken, about half an Hour before high Water. I waded with what Haste I could,
            and swam in the Middle about thirty Yards until I felt the Ground; I arrived at the Fleet in</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>less than half an Hour. The Enemy was so frighted when they saw me, that they leaped out of their Ships, and
            swam to Shore; where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand Souls. I then took my Tackling, and
            fastning a Hook to the Hole at the Prow of each, I tyed all the Cords together at the End. While I was thus
            employed, the Enemy discharged several Thousand Arrows, many of which stuck in my Hands and Face; and
            besides the excessive Smart, gave me much Disturbance in my Work. My greatest Apprehension was for mine
            Eyes, which I should have infallibly lost, if I had not suddenly thought of an Expedient. I kept, among
            other little Neces-saries, a Pair of Spectacles in a private Pocket, which, as I observed before, had
            escaped the Emperor&rsquo;s Searchers. These I took out, and fastened as strongly as I could upon my Nose;
            and thus armed went on boldly with my Work in spight of the Enemy&rsquo;s Arrows; many of which struck
            against the Glasses of my Spectacles, but without any other Eﬀect, further than a little to discompose them.
            I had now fastened all the Hooks, and taking the Knot in my Hand, began to pull; but not a Ship would stir,
            for they were all too fast held by their Anchors; so that the boldest Part of my Enterprize remained. I
            therefore let go the Cord, and leaving the Hooks fixed to the Ships, I resolutely cut with my Knife the
            Cables that fastened the Anchors; receiving above two hundred Shots in my Face and Hands: Then I took up the
            knotted End of the Cables to which my Hooks were tyed; and with great Ease drew fifty of the Enemy&rsquo;s
            largest Men of War after me.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The <em>Blefuscudians</em>, who had not the least Imagination of what I intended, were at first confounded
            with Astonishment. They had seen me cut the Cables, and thought my Design was only to let the Ships run
            a-drift, or fall foul on each other: But when they perceived the whole Fleet moving in Order, and saw me
            pulling at the End, they set up such a Scream of Grief and Dispair, that it is almost impossible to describe
            or conceive. When I had got out of Danger, I stopt a while to pick out the Arrows that stuck in my Hands and
            Face, and rubbed on some of the same Ointment that was given me at my first Arrival, as I have formerly
            mentioned. I then took oﬀ my Spectacles, and waiting about an Hour until the Tyde was a little fallen, I
            waded through the Middle with my Cargo, and arrived safe at the Royal Port of <em>Lilliput.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Emperor and his whole Court stood on the Shore, expecting</p>

        <p>the Issue of this great Adventure. They saw the Ships move forward in a large Half-Moon, but could not
            discern me, who was up to my Breast in Water. When I advanced to the Middle of the Channel, they were yet
            more in Pain because I was under Water to my Neck. The Emperor concluded me to be drowned, and that the
            Enemy&rsquo;s Fleet was approaching in a hostile Manner: But he was soon eased of his Fears; for the Channel
            growing shallower every Step I made, I came in a short Time within Hearing; and holding up the End of the
            Cable by which the Fleet was fastened, I cryed in a loud Voice, <em>Long live the most puissant Emperor of
                Lilliput!</em> This great Prince received me at my Landing with all possible Encomiums, and created me a
            <em>Nardac</em> upon the Spot, which is the highest Title of Honour among them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His Majesty desired I would take some other Opportunity of bringing all the rest of his Enemy&rsquo;s Ships
            into his Ports. And so unmeasurable is the Ambition of Princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than
            reducing the whole Empire of <em>Blefuscu</em> into a Province, and governing it by a Viceroy;* of
            destroying the <em>Big-Endian</em> Exiles, and compelling that People to break the smaller End of their
            Eggs; by which he would remain sole Monarch of the whole World. But I endeavoured to divert him from this
            Design, by many Arguments drawn from the Topicks* of Policy as well as Justice: And I plainly protested,
            that I would never be an Instrument of bringing a free and brave People into Slavery: And when the Matter
            was debated in Council, the wisest Part of the Ministry were of my Opinion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This open bold Declaration of mine was so opposite to the Schemes and Politicks of his Imperial Majesty, that
            he could never forgive me: He mentioned it in a very artful Manner at Council, where, I was told, that some
            of the wisest appeared, at least by their Silence, to be of my Opinion; but others, who were my secret
            Enemies, could not forbear some Expressions, which by a Side-wind reflected on me. And from this Time began
            an Intrigue between his Majesty, and a Junta* of Ministers maliciously bent against me, which broke out in
            less than two Months, and had like to have ended in my utter Destruction. Of so little Weight are the
            greatest Services to Princes, when put into the Balance with a Refusal to gratify their Passions.</p>

        <p>Embassy from <em>Blefuscu</em>, with humble Oﬀers of a Peace; which was soon concluded upon Conditions very
            advantageous to our Emperor; wherewith I shall not trouble the Reader. There were six Ambassadors, with a
            Train of about five Hundred Persons; and their Entry was very magnificent, suitable to the Grandeur of their
            Master, and the Importance of their Business. When their Treaty was finished, wherein I did them several
            good Oﬃces by the Credit I now had, or at least appeared to have at Court; their Excellencies, who were
            privately told how much I had been their Friend, made me a Visit in Form.* They began with many Compliments
            upon my Valour and Generosity; invited me to that Kingdom in the Emperor their Master&rsquo;s Name; and
            desired me to shew them some Proofs of my prodigious Strength, of which they had heard so many Wonders;
            wherein I readily obliged them, but shall not interrupt the Reader with the Particulars.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I had for some time entertained their Excellencies to their infinite Satisfaction and Surprize, I
            desired they would do me the Honour to present my most humble Respects to the Emperor their Master, the
            Renown of whose Virtues had so justly filled the whole World with Admiration, and whose Royal Person I
            resolved to attend before I returned to my own Country. Accordingly, the next time I had the Honour to see
            our Emperor, I desired his general Licence to wait on the <em>Blefuscudian</em> Monarch, which he was
            pleased to grant me, as I could plainly perceive, in a very cold Manner; but could not guess the Reason,
            till I had a Whisper from a certain Person, that <em>Flimnap</em> and <em>Bolgolam</em> had represented my
            Intercourse with those Ambassadors, as a Mark of Disaﬀec-tion,* from which I am sure my Heart was wholly
            free. And this was the first time I began to conceive some imperfect Idea of Courts and Ministers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is to be observed, that these Ambassadors spoke to me by an Interpreter; the Languages of both Empires
            diﬀering as much from each other as any two in <em>Europe</em>, and each Nation priding itself upon the
            Antiquity, Beauty, and Energy of their own Tongues, with an avowed Contempt for that of their Neighbour: Yet
            our Emperor standing upon the Advantage he had got by the Seizure of their Fleet, obliged them to deliver
            their Credentials, and make their Speech in the <em>Lilliputian</em> Tongue. And it must be confessed, that

            the World, and understanding Men and Manners; there are few Persons of Distinction, or Merchants, or Seamen,
            who dwell in the Maritime Parts, but what can hold Con-versation in both Tongues; as I found some Weeks
            after, when I went to pay my Respects to the Emperor of <em>Blefuscu</em>, which in the Midst of great
            Misfortunes, through the Malice of my Enemies, proved a very happy Adventure to me, as I shall relate in its
            proper Place.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Reader may remember, that when I signed those Articles upon which I recovered my Liberty, there were some
            which I disliked upon Account of their being too servile, neither could any thing but an extreme Necessity
            have forced me to submit. But being now a <em>Nardac</em>, of the highest Rank in that Empire, such Oﬃces
            were looked upon as below my Dignity; and the Emperor (to do him Justice) never once mentioned them to me.
            However, it was not long before I had an Opportunity of doing his Majesty, at least, as I then thought, a
            most signal Service. I was alarmed at Midnight with the Cries of many Hundred People at my Door; by which
            being sud-denly awaked, I was in some Kind of Terror. I heard the Word <em>Burglum</em> repeated
            incessantly; several of the Emperor&rsquo;s Court making their Way through the Croud, intreated me to come
            immediately to the Palace, where her Imperial Majesty&rsquo;s Apartment was on fire, by the Carelessness of
            a Maid of Honour, who fell asleep while she was reading a Romance.* I got up in an Instant; and Orders being
            given to clear the Way before me; and it being likewise a Moon-shine Night, I made a shift to get to the
            Palace without trampling on any of the People. I found they had already applied Ladders to the Walls of the
            Apartment, and were well provided with Buckets, but the Water was at some Distance. These Buckets were about
            the Size of a large Thimble, and the poor People supplied me with them as fast as they could; but the Flame
            was so violent, that they did little Good. I might easily have stifled it with my Coat, which I
            unfortunately left behind me for haste, and came away only in my Leathern Jerkin. The Case seemed wholly
            desperate and deplorable; and this magnifi-cent Palace would have infallibly been burnt down to the Ground,
            if, by a Presence of Mind, unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an Expedient. I had the Evening
            before drank plentifully of a most</p>

        <p>delicious Wine, called <em>Glimigrim</em>, (the <em>Blefuscudians</em> call it <em>Flunec,</em> but ours is
            esteemed the better Sort) which is very diuretick. By the luckiest Chance in the World, I had not discharged
            myself of any Part of it. The Heat I had contracted by coming very near the Flames, and by my labouring to
            quench them, made the Wine begin to operate by Urine; which I voided in such a Quantity, and applied so well
            to the proper Places, that in three Minutes the Fire was wholly extinguished;* and the rest of that noble
            Pile, which had cost so many Ages in erecting, preserved from Destruction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was now Day-light, and I returned to my House, without waiting to congratulate with the Emperor; because,
            although I had done a very eminent Piece of Service, yet I could not tell how his Majesty might resent the
            Manner by which I had performed it: For, by the fundamental Laws of the Realm, it is Capital* in any Person,
            of what Quality soever, to make water within the Precincts of the Palace. But I was a little comforted by a
            Message from his Majesty, that he would give Orders to the Grand Justiciary for passing my Pardon in Form;
            which, however, I could not obtain. And I was privately assured, that the Empress conceiving the greatest
            Abhorrence of what I had done, removed to the most distant Side of the Court, firmly resolved that those
            Buildings should never be repaired for her Use; and, in the Presence of her chief Confidents, could not
            forbear vowing Revenge.</p>

        <p><em>Of the Inhabitants of</em> Lilliput<em>; their Learning, Laws, and Customs. The Manner of Educating their
                Children. The Author&rsquo;s Way of living in that Country. His Vindication of a great Lady.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A lt h o u g h I intend to leave the Description of this Empire to a particular Treatise, yet in the mean
            time I am content to gratify the curious Reader with some general Ideas.* As the common Size of the Natives
            is somewhat under six Inches, so there is an exact Proportion in all other Animals, as well as Plants and
            Trees: For Instance, the tallest Horses and Oxen are between four and five Inches in Height, the Sheep an
            Inch and a half, more or less; their Geese about the Bigness of a Sparrow; and so the several Gradations
            downwards, till you come to the smallest, which, to my Sight, were almost invisible; but Nature hath adapted
            the Eyes of the <em>Lilliputians</em> to all Objects proper for their View: They see with great Exactness,
            but at no great Distance. And to show the Sharpness of their Sight towards Objects that are near, I have
            been much pleased with observing a Cook pulling a Lark,* which was not so large as a common Fly; and a young
            Girl threading an invisible Needle with invisible Silk. Their tallest Trees are about seven Foot high; I
            mean some of those in the great Royal Park, the Tops whereof I could but just reach with my Fist clinched.*
            The other Vegetables are in the same Proportion: But this I leave to the Reader&rsquo;s Imagination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I shall say but little at present of their Learning, which for many Ages hath flourished in all its Branches
            among them: But their Manner of Writing* is very peculiar; being neither from the Left to the Right, like
            the <em>Europeans</em>; nor from the Right to the Left, like the <em>Arabians</em>; nor from up to down,
            like the <em>Chinese</em>; nor from down to up, like the <em>Cascagians</em>; but aslant from one Corner of
            the Paper to the other, like Ladies in <em>England.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They bury their Dead with their Heads directly downwards;* because they hold an Opinion, that in eleven
            Thousand Moons they are all to rise again; in which Period, the Earth (which they conceive to be flat) will
            turn upside down, and by this Means they shall, at their Resurrection, be found ready standing on their</p>

        <p>Feet. The Learned among them confess the Absurdity of this Doctrine; but the Practice still continues, in
            Compliance to the Vulgar.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are some Laws and Customs in this Empire very peculiar; and if they were not so directly contrary to
            those of my own dear Country, I should be tempted to say a little in their Justification. It is only to be
            wished, that they were as well executed. The first I shall mention, relateth to Informers. All Crimes
            against the State, are punished here with the utmost Severity; but if the Person accused make his Innocence
            plainly to appear upon his Tryal, the Accuser is immediately put to an ignominious Death; and out of his
            Goods or Lands, the innocent Person is quadruply recompensed for the Loss of his Time, for the Danger he
            underwent, for the Hardship of his Imprisonment, and for all the Charges he hath been at* in making his
            Defence. Or, if that Fund be deficient, it is largely supplyed by the Crown. The Emperor doth also confer on
            him some publick Mark of his Favour; and Proclamation is made of his Innocence through the whole City.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They look upon Fraud as a greater Crime than Theft, and there-fore seldom fail to punish it with Death: For
            they alledge, that Care and Vigilance, with a very common understanding, may preserve a Man&rsquo;s Goods
            from Thieves; but Honesty hath no Fence against superior Cunning: And since it is necessary that there
            should be a perpetual Intercourse of buying and selling, and dealing upon Credit; where Fraud is permitted
            or connived at, or hath no Law to punish it, the honest Dealer is always undone, and the Knave gets the
            Advantage. I remember when I was once interceeding with the King for a Criminal who had wronged his Master
            of a great Sum of Money, which he had received by Order, and ran away with; and happening to tell his
            Majesty, by way of Extenuation, that it was only a Breach of Trust; The Emperor thought it monstrous in me
            to oﬀer, as a Defence, the greatest Aggravation of the Crime: And truly, I had little to say in Return,
            farther than the common Answer, that diﬀerent Nations had diﬀerent Customs;* for, I confess, I was heartily
            ashamed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although we usually call Reward and Punishment, the two Hinges* upon which all Government turns; yet I could
            never observe this Maxim to be put in Practice by any Nation, except that of <em>Lilliput</em>.* Whoever can
            there bring suﬃcient Proof that he hath strictly</p>

            his Quality and Condition of Life, with a proportionable Sum of Money out of a Fund appropriated for that
            Use: He likewise acquires the Title of <em>Snilpall</em>, or <em>Legal</em>, which is added to his Name, but
            doth not descend to his Posterity. And these People thought it a prodigious Defect of Policy among us, when
            I told them that our Laws were enforced only by Penalties, without any Mention of Reward. It is upon this
            account that the Image of Justice, in their Courts of Judicature, is formed with six Eyes, two before, as
            many behind, and on each Side one, to signify Circumspection; with a Bag of Gold open in her right Hand, and
            a Sword sheathed in her left, to shew she is more disposed to reward than to punish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In chusing Persons* for all Employments, they have more Regard to good Morals than to great Abilities: For,
            since Government is necessary to Mankind, they believe that the common Size of human Understandings, is
            fitted to some Station or other; and that Provi-dence never intended to make the Management of publick
            Aﬀairs a Mystery, to be comprehended only by a few Persons of sublime Genius, of which there seldom are
            three born in an Age: But, they suppose Truth, Justice, Temperance, and the like, to be in every Man&rsquo;s
            Power; the Practice of which Virtues, assisted by Experience and a good Intention, would qualify any Man for
            the Service of his Country, except where a Course of Study is required. But they thought the Want of Moral
            Virtues was so far from being supplied by superior Endowments of the Mind, that Employments could never be
            put into such dangerous Hands as those of Persons so qualified; and at least, that the Mistakes committed by
            Ignorance in a virtuous Disposition, would never be of such fatal Consequence to the Publick Weal, as the
            Practices* of a Man, whose Inclinations led him to be corrupt, and had great Abilities to manage, to
            multiply, and defend his Corruptions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In like Manner, the Disbelief of a Divine Providence renders a Man uncapable of holding any publick Station:*
            For, since Kings avow themselves to be the Deputies of Providence, the <em>Lilliputians</em> think nothing
            can be more absurd than for a Prince to employ such Men as disown the Authority under which he acteth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In relating these and the following Laws, I would only be under-stood to mean the original Institutions, and
            not the most scandalous</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Corruptions into which these People are fallen by the degenerate Nature of Man. For as to that infamous
            Practice of acquiring great Employments by dancing on the Ropes, or Badges of Favour and Distinction by
            leaping over Sticks, and creeping under them; the Reader is to observe, that they were first introduced by
            the Grand-father of the Emperor now reigning; and grew to the present Height, by the gradual Increase of
            Party and Faction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ingratitude is among them a capital Crime,* as we read it to have been in some other Countries: For they
            reason thus; that whoever makes ill Returns to his Benefactor, must needs be a common Enemy to the rest of
            Mankind, from whom he hath received no Obligation; and therefore such a Man is not fit to live.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their Notions relating to the Duties of Parents and Children diﬀer extremely from ours.* For, since the
            Conjunction of Male and Female is founded upon the great Law of Nature, in order to propa-gate and continue
            the Species; the <em>Lilliputians</em> will needs have it, that Men and Women are joined together like other
            Animals, by the Motives of Concupiscence; and that their Tenderness towards their Young, proceedeth from the
            like natural Principle: For which Reason they will never allow, that a Child is under any Obligation to his
            Father for begetting him, or to his Mother for bringing him into the World;* which, considering the Miseries
            of human Life, was neither a Benefit in itself, nor intended so by his Parents, whose Thoughts in their
            Love-encounters were otherwise employed. Upon these, and the like Reasonings, their Opinion is, that Parents
            are the last of all others to be trusted with the Education of their own Children:* And therefore they have
            in every Town publick Nurseries, where all Parents, except Cottagers and Labourers, are obliged to send
            their Infants of both Sexes to be reared and educated when they come to the Age of twenty Moons; at which
            Time they are supposed to have some Rudiments of Docility. These Schools are of several kinds, suited to
            diﬀerent Qualities, and to both Sexes. They have certain Professors* well skilled in preparing Children for
            such a Condition of Life as befits the Rank of their Parents, and their own Capacities as well as
            Inclinations. I shall first say something of the Male Nurseries, and then of the Female.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Nurseries for Males of Noble or Eminent Birth, are provided with grave and learned Professors, and their
            several Deputies. The Clothes and Food of the Children are plain and simple. They are</p>

        <p>bred up in the Principles of Honour, Justice, Courage, Modesty, Clemency, Religion, and Love of their
            Country: They are always employed* in some Business, except in the Times of eating and sleeping, which are
            very short, and two Hours for Diversions, con-sisting of bodily Exercises. They are dressed by Men until
            four Years of Age, and then are obliged to dress themselves, although their Quality be ever so great; and
            the Women Attendants, who are aged proportionably to ours at fifty, perform only the most menial Oﬃces. They
            are never suﬀered to converse with Servants, but go together in small or greater Numbers to take their
            Diversions, and always in the Presence of a Professor, or one of his Deputies; whereby they avoid those
            early bad Impressions of Folly and Vice to which our Children are subject. Their Parents are suﬀered to see
            them only twice a Year; the Visit is not to last above an Hour; they are allowed to kiss the Child at
            Meeting and Parting; but a Professor, who always standeth by on those Occasions, will not suﬀer them to
            whis-per, or use any fondling Expressions, or bring any presents of Toys, Sweet-meats, and the like.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Pension from each Family for the Education and Entertain-ment of a Child, upon Failure of due Payment, is
            levyed by the Emperor&rsquo;s Oﬃcers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Nurseries for Children of ordinary Gentlemen, Merchants, Traders, and Handicrafts, are managed
            proportionably after the same Manner; only those designed for Trades, are put out Appren-tices at seven
            Years old; whereas those of Persons of Quality con-tinue in their Exercises until Fifteen, which answers to
            One and Twenty with us: But the Confinement is gradually lessened for the last three Years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the Female Nurseries, the young Girls of Quality are educated much like the Males, only they are dressed
            by orderly Servants of their own Sex, but always in the Presence of a Professor or Deputy, until they come
            to dress themselves, which is at five Years old. And if it be found that these Nurses ever presume to
            entertain the Girls with frightful or foolish Stories,* or the common Follies practised by Chamber-Maids
            among us; they are publickly whipped thrice about the City, imprisoned for a Year, and banished for Life to
            the most desolate Part of the Country. Thus the young Ladies there are as much ashamed of being Cowards and
            Fools, as the Men; and despise all personal Ornaments* beyond Decency and Cleanliness; neither</p>

        <p>did I perceive any Diﬀerence* in their Education, made by their Diﬀerence of Sex, only that the Exercises of
            the Females were not altogether so robust; and that some Rules were given them relating to domestick Life,
            and a smaller Compass of Learning was enjoyned them: For, their Maxim is, that among People of Quality, a
            Wife should be always a reasonable and agreeable Companion, because she cannot always be young.* When the
            Girls are twelve Years old, which among them is the marriageable Age, their Parents or Guardians take them
            home, with great Expressions of Gratitude to the Professors, and seldom without Tears of the young Lady and
            her Companions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the Nurseries of Females of the meaner Sort, the Children are instructed in all Kinds of Works proper for
            their Sex, and their several Degrees: Those intended for Apprentices are dismissed at seven Years old, the
            rest are kept to eleven.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The meaner Families who have Children at these Nurseries, are obliged, besides their annual Pension, which is
            as low as possible, to return to the Steward of the Nursery a small Monthly Share of their Gettings, to be a
            Portion for the Child; and therefore all Parents are limited in their Expences by the Law. For the
            <em>Lilliputians</em> think nothing can be more unjust, than that People, in Subservience to their own
            Appetites, should bring Children into the World, and leave the Burthen of supporting them on the Publick. As
            to Persons of Quality, they give Security to appropriate a certain Sum for each Child, suitable to their
            Condition; and these Funds are always managed with good Husbandry, and the most exact Justice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Cottagers and Labourers keep their Children at home, their Business being only to till and cultivate the
            Earth; and therefore their Education is of little Consequence to the Publick; but the Old and Diseased among
            them are supported by Hospitals: For begging is a Trade unknown in this Empire.</p>

        <p>And here it may perhaps divert the curious Reader, to give some Account of my Domestick,* and my Manner of
            living in this Country, during a Residence of nine Months and thirteen Days. Having a Head mechanically
            turned,* and being likewise forced by Necessity, I had made for myself a Table and Chair convenient enough,
            out of the largest Trees in the Royal Park. Two hundred Sempstresses were employed to make me Shirts, and
            Linnen for my Bed and Table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they could get; which, however, they
            were forced to quilt together in several Folds; for the thickest</p>

        <p>was some Degrees finer than Lawn. Their Linnen is usually three Inches wide, and three Foot make a Piece. The
            Sempstresses took my Measure as I lay on the Ground, one standing at my Neck, and another at my Mid-Leg,
            with a strong Cord extended, that each held by the End, while the third measured the Length of the Cord with
            a Rule of an Inch long. Then they measured my right Thumb, and desired no more; for by a mathematical
            Computation, that twice round the Thumb is once round the Wrist, and so on to the Neck and the Waist; and by
            the Help of my old Shirt, which I displayed on the Ground before them for a Pattern, they fitted me exactly.
            Three hundred Taylors were employed in the same Manner to make me Clothes; but they had another Contrivance
            for taking my Measure. I kneeled down, and they raised a Ladder from the Ground to my Neck; upon this Ladder
            one of them mounted, and let fall a Plum-Line from my Collar to the Floor, which just answered the Length of
            my Coat; but my Waist and Arms I measured myself. When my Cloaths were finished, which was done in my House,
            (for the largest of theirs would not have been able to hold them) they looked like the Patch-work made by
            the Ladies in <em>England</em>, only that mine were all of a Colour.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had three hundred Cooks to dress my Victuals, in little conveni-ent Huts built about my House, where they
            and their Families lived, and prepared me two Dishes a-piece. I took up twenty Waiters in my Hand, and
            placed them on the Table; an hundred more attended below on the Ground, some with Dishes of Meat, and some
            with Barrels of Wine, and other Liquors, slung on their Shoulders; all which the Waiters above drew up as I
            wanted, in a very ingenious Manner, by certain Cords, as we draw the Bucket up a Well in <em>Europe</em>. A
            Dish of their Meat was a good Mouthful, and a Barrel of their Liquor a reasonable Draught. Their Mutton
            yields to ours,* but their Beef is excellent. I have had a Sirloin so large, that I have been forced to make
            three Bits* of it; but this is rare. My Servants were astonished to see me eat it Bones and all, as in our
            Country we do the Leg of a Lark. Their Geese and Turkeys I usually eat at a Mouthful, and I must confess
            they far exceed ours. Of their smaller Fowl I could take up twenty or thirty at the End of my Knife.</p>

        <p>One Day his Imperial Majesty being informed of my Way of living, desired that himself, and his Royal Consort;
            with the young Princes of the Blood of both Sexes, might have the Happiness (as he</p>

        <p>was pleased to call it) of dining with me. They came accordingly, and I placed them upon Chairs of State on
            my Table, just over against me, with their Guards about them. <em>Flimnap</em> the Lord High Treas-urer
            attended there likewise, with his white Staﬀ;* and I observed he often looked on me with a sour Countenance,
            which I would not seem to regard, but eat more than usual, in Honour to my dear Country, as well as to fill
            the Court with Admiration. I have some private Reasons to believe, that this Visit from his Majesty gave
            <em>Flimnap</em> an Opportunity of doing me ill Oﬃces to his Master. That Minister had always been my secret
            Enemy, although he outwardly caressed* me more than was usual to the Moroseness of his Nature. He
            represented to the Emperor the low Condition of his Treasury; that he was forced to take up Money at great
            Discount;* that Exchequer Bills would not circulate under nine <em>per Cent</em>. below Par; that I had cost
            his Majesty above a Million and a half of <em>Sprugs</em>, (their greatest Gold Coin, about the Bigness of a
            Spangle;) and upon the whole, that it would be adviseable in the Emperor to take the first fair Occasion of
            dismissing me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am here obliged to vindicate the Reputation of an excellent Lady, who was an innocent Suﬀerer upon my
            Account. The Treasurer took a Fancy to be jealous of his Wife, from the Malice of some evil Tongues, who
            informed him that her Grace had taken a violent Aﬀection for my Person; and the Court-Scandal ran for some
            Time that she once came privately to my Lodging. This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous Falshood,
            without any Grounds, farther than that her Grace was pleased to treat me with all innocent Marks of Freedom
            and Friendship. I own she came often to my House, but always publickly, nor ever without three more in the
            Coach, who were usually her Sister, and young Daughter, and some particular Acquaintance; but this was
            common to many other Ladies of the Court. And I still appeal to my Servants round, whether they at any Time
            saw a Coach at my Door without knowing what Persons were in it. On those Occasions, when a Servant had given
            me Notice, my Custom was to go immediately to the Door; and after paying my Respects, to take up the Coach
            and two Horses very carefully in my Hands, (for if there were six Horses, the Postillion always unharnessed
            four) and place them on a Table, where I had fixed a moveable Rim quite round, of five Inches high, to
            prevent Accidents. And I have often had four Coaches and Horses at once on my Table</p>

        <p>full of Company, while I sat in my Chair leaning my Face towards them; and when I was engaged with one Sett,
            the Coachmen would gently drive the others round my Table. I have passed many an Afternoon very agreeably in
            these Conversations: But I defy the Treasurer, or his two Informers. (I will name them, and let them make
            their best of it) <em>Clustril</em> and <em>Drunlo</em>, to prove that any Person ever came to me
            <em>incognito</em>,* except the Secretary <em>Reldresal</em>, who was sent by express Command of his
            Imperial Majesty, as I have before related. I should not have dwelt so long upon this Particular, if it had
            not been a Point wherein the Reputation of a great Lady is so nearly concerned; to say nothing of my own;
            although I had the Honour to be a <em>Nardac</em>, which the Treasurer himself is not; for all the World
            knows he is only a <em>Clumglum</em>, a Title inferior by one Degree, as that of a Marquess is to a Duke in
            <em>England</em>; yet I allow he preceded me in right of his Post. These false Informations, which I
            afterwards came to the Knowledge of, by an Accident not proper to mention, made the Treasurer shew his Lady
            for some Time an ill Countenance, and me a worse: For although he were at last undeceived and reconciled to
            her, yet I lost all Credit with him; and found my Interest decline very fast with the Emperor himself, who
            was indeed too much governed by that Favourite.</p>

            <em>His Reception there.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>B e f o r e I proceed to give an Account of my leaving this Kingdom, it may be proper to inform the Reader of
            a private Intrigue which had been for two Months forming against me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had been hitherto all my Life a Stranger to Courts, for which I was unqualified by the Meanness of my
            Condition. I had indeed heard and read enough of the Dispositions of great Princes and Ministers; but never
            expected to have found such terrible Eﬀects of them in so remote a Country,* governed, as I thought, by very
            diﬀerent Maxims from those in <em>Europe.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I was just preparing to pay my Attendance on the Emperor of <em>Blefuscu</em>; a considerable Person at
            Court (to whom I had been very serviceable at a time when he lay under the highest Displeasure of his
            Imperial Majesty) came to my House very privately at Night in a close Chair, and without sending his Name,
            desired Admittance: The Chair-men were dismissed; I put the Chair, with his Lordship in it, into my
            Coat-Pocket; and giving Orders to a trusty Servant to say I was indisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the
            Door of my House, placed the Chair on the Table, according to my usual Custom, and sat down by it. After the
            common Salutations were over, observing his Lordship&rsquo;s Countenance full of Concern; and enquiring into
            the Reason, he desired I would hear him with Patience, in a Matter that highly concerned my Honour and my
            Life. His Speech was to the following Eﬀect, for I took Notes of it as soon as he left me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You are to know, said he, that several Committees of Council have been lately called in the most private
            Manner on your Account: And it is but two Days since his Majesty came to a full Resolution.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You are very sensible that <em>Skyris Bolgolam</em> (<em>Galbet</em>, or High Admiral) hath been your mortal
            Enemy almost ever since your Arrival. His original Reasons I know not; but his Hatred is much encreased

            Enmity against you is notori-ous on Account of his Lady; <em>Limtoc</em> the General, <em>Lalcon</em> the
            Chamberlain, and <em>Balmu</em><em>ﬀ</em> the grand Justiciary, have prepared Articles of Impeachment
            against you, for Treason, and other capital Crimes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own Merits and Innocence, that I was going to
            interrupt; when he intreated me to be silent; and thus proceeded.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Out of Gratitude of the Favours you have done me, I procured Information of the whole Proceedings, and a Copy
            of the Articles, wherein I venture my Head for your Service.</p>

        <p>a rt i c l e i .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whereas, by a Statute made in the Reign of his Imperial Majesty <em>Calin De</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>ar Plune</em>,
            it is enacted, That whoever shall make water within the Precincts of the Royal Palace, shall be liable to
            the Pains and Penalties of High Treason: Notwithstanding, the said <em>Quinbus Flestrin</em>, in open Breach
            of the said Law, under Colour* of extin-guishing the Fire kindled in the Apartment of his Majesty&rsquo;s
            most dear Imperial Consort, did maliciously, traitorously, and devilishly, by discharge of his Urine, put
            out the said Fire kindled in the said Apartment, lying and being within the Precincts of the said Royal
            Palace; against the Statute in that Case provided, &amp;c. against the Duty, &amp;c.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That the said <em>Quinbus Flestrin</em> having brought the Imperial Fleet of <em>Blefuscu</em> into the Royal
            Port, and being afterwards commanded by his Imperial Majesty to seize all the other Ships of the said Empire
            of <em>Blefuscu</em>, and reduce that Empire to a Province, to be governed by a Vice-Roy from hence; and to
            destroy and put to death not only all the <em>Big-Endian Exiles</em>, but likewise all the People of that
            Empire, who would not immediately forsake the <em>Big-Endian</em> Heresy: He the said <em>Flestrin</em>,

        <p>That, whereas certain Embassadors arrived from the Court of <em>Blefuscu</em> to sue for Peace in his
            Majesty&rsquo;s Court: He the said <em>Flestrin</em> did, like a false Traitor, aid, abet, comfort, and
            divert the said Embassadors; although he knew them to be Servants to a Prince who was lately an open Enemy
            to his Imperial Majesty, and in open War against his said Majesty.</p>

        <p>That the said <em>Quinbus Flestrin</em>, contrary to the Duty of a faithful Subject, is now preparing to make
            a Voyage to the Court and Empire of <em>Blefuscu</em>, for which he hath received only verbal Licence from
            his Imperial Majesty; and under Colour of the said Licence, doth falsely and traitorously intend to take the
            said Voyage, and thereby to aid, comfort, and abet the Emperor of <em>Blefuscu</em>, so late an Enemy, and
            in open War with his Imperial Majesty aforesaid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are some other Articles, but these are the most important, of which I have read you an Abstract.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the several Debates upon this Impeachment, it must be con-fessed that his Majesty gave many Marks of his
            great <em>Lenity</em>; often urging the Services you had done him, and endeavouring to extenu-ate your
            Crimes. The Treasurer and Admiral insisted that you should be put to the most painful and ignominious Death,
            by setting Fire on your House at Night; and the General was to attend with Twenty Thousand Men armed with
            poisoned Arrows, to shoot you on the Face and Hands. Some of your Servants were to have private Orders to
            strew a poisonous Juice on your Shirts* and Sheets, which would soon make you tear your own Flesh, and die
            in the utmost Torture. The General came into the same Opinion; so that for a long time there was a Majority
            against you. But his Majesty, resolving, if possible, to spare your Life, at last brought oﬀ* the
            Chamberlain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Upon this Incident, <em>Reldresal</em>, principal Secretary for private Aﬀairs, who always approved himself
            your true Friend, was</p>

        <p>commanded by the Emperor to deliver his Opinion, which he accordingly did; and therein justified the good
            Thoughts you have of him. He allowed your Crimes to be great; but that still there was room for Mercy, the
            most commendable Virtue in a Prince, and for which his Majesty was so justly celebrated. He said, the
            Friendship between you and him was so well known to the World, that perhaps the most honourable Board might
            think him partial: However, in Obedience to the Command he had received, he would freely oﬀer his
            Sentiments. That if his Majesty, in Consideration of your Ser-vices, and pursuant to his own merciful
            Disposition, would please to spare your Life, and only give order to put out both your Eyes;* he humbly
            conceived, that by this Expedient, Justice might in some measure be satisfied, and all the World would
            applaud the <em>Lenity</em> of the Emperor, as well as the fair and generous Proceedings of those who have
            the Honour to be his Counsellors. That the Loss of your Eyes would be no Impediment to your bodily
            Strength,* by which you might still be useful to his Majesty. That Blindness is an Addition to Courage, by
            concealing Dangers from us; that the Fear you had for your Eyes, was the greatest Diﬃculty in bringing over
            the Enemy&rsquo;s Fleet; and it would be suﬃcient for you to see by the Eyes of the Ministers, since the
            greatest Princes do no more.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Proposal was received with the utmost Disapprobation by the whole Board. <em>Bolgolam</em>, the Admiral,
            could not preserve his Temper; but rising up in Fury, said, he wondered how the Secretary durst presume to
            give his Opinion for preserving the Life of a Traytor: That the Services you had performed, were, by all
            Reasons of State,* the great Aggravation of your Crimes; that you, who were able to extinguish the Fire, by
            discharge of Urine in her Majesty&rsquo;s Apartment (which he mentioned with Horror) might, at another time,
            raise an Inundation by the same Means, to drown the whole Palace; and the same Strength which enabled you to
            bring over the Enemy&rsquo;s Fleet, might serve, upon the first Discontent, to carry it back: That he had
            good Reasons to think you were a <em>Big-Endian</em> in your Heart; and as Treason begins in the Heart
            before it appears in Overt-Acts; so he accused you as a Traytor on that Account, and therefore insisted you
            should be put to death.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Treasurer was of the same Opinion; he shewed to what Streights his Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue was reduced by
            the Charge of maintaining you, which would soon grow insupportable: That the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>64&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Secretary&rsquo;s Expedient of putting out your Eyes, was so far from being a Remedy against this Evil, that
            it would probably increase it; as it is manifest from the common Practice of blinding some Kind of Fowl,
            after which they fed the faster, and grew sooner fat: That his sacred Majesty, and the Council, who are your
            Judges, were in their own Consciences fully convinced of your Guilt; which was a suﬃcient Argument to
            condemn you to death, without the <em>formal Proofs</em>*</p>
        <p><em>required by the strict Letter of the Law.</em></p>
        <p>But his Imperial Majesty fully determined against capital Pun-ishment, was graciously pleased to say, that
            since the Council thought the Loss of your Eyes too easy a Censure, some other may be inflicted hereafter.
            And your Friend the Secretary humbly desiring to be heard again, in Answer to what the Treasurer had
            objected concerning the great Charge his Majesty was at in maintaining you; said, that his Excellency, who
            had the sole Disposal of the Emperor&rsquo;s Revenue, might easily provide against this Evil, by gradually
            lessening your Establishment; by which, for want of suﬃcient Food, you would grow weak and faint, and lose
            your Appetite, and con-sequently decay and consume in a few Months; neither would the Stench of your Carcass
            be then so dangerous, when it should become more than half diminished; and immediately upon your Death, five
            or six Thousand of his Majesty&rsquo;s Subjects might, in two or three Days, cut your Flesh from your Bones,
            take it away by Cart-loads, and bury it in distant Parts to prevent Infection; leaving the Skeleton as a
            Monument of Admiration to Posterity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thus by the great Friendship of the Secretary, the whole Aﬀair was compromised. It was strictly enjoined,
            that the Project of starving you by Degrees should be kept a Secret; but the Sentence of putting out your
            Eyes was entered on the Books; none dissenting except <em>Bolgolam</em> the Admiral, who being a Creature of
            the Empress, was perpetually instigated by her Majesty to insist upon your Death; she having born perpetual
            Malice against you, on Account of that infamous and illegal Method you took to extinguish the Fire in her
            Apartment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In three Days your Friend the Secretary will be directed to come to your House, and read before you the
            Articles of Impeachment; and then to signify the great <em>Lenity</em> and Favour of his Majesty and
            Coun-cil; whereby you are only condemned to the Loss of your Eyes, which his Majesty doth not question you
            will gratefully and humbly submit to; and Twenty of his Majesty&rsquo;s Surgeons will attend, in order</p>

        <p>to see the Operation well performed, by discharging very sharp pointed Arrows into the Balls of your Eyes, as
            you lie on the Ground.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I leave to your Prudence what Measures you will take; and to avoid Suspicion, I must immediately return in as
            private a Manner as I came.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His Lordship did so, and I remained alone, under many Doubts and Perplexities of Mind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a Custom introduced by this Prince and his Ministry, (very diﬀerent, as I have been assured, from the
            Practices of former Times) that after the Court had decreed any cruel Execution, either to gratify the
            Monarch&rsquo;s Resentment, or the Malice of a Favourite; the Emperor always made a Speech to his whole
            Council, expressing his <em>great Lenity and Tenderness, as Qualities known and confessed by all the
                World</em>. This Speech was immediately published through the Kingdom; nor did any thing terrify the
            People so much as those Encomiums on his Majesty&rsquo;s Mercy;* because it was observed, that the more
            these Praises were enlarged and insisted on, the more <em>inhuman</em> was the Punishment, and the
            <em>Su</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>erer more innocent</em>. Yet, as to myself, I must confess, having never been
            designed for a Courtier, either by my Birth or Education, I was so ill a Judge of Things, that I could not
            discover the <em>Lenity</em> and Favour of this Sentence; but con-ceived it (perhaps erroneously) rather to
            be rigorous than gentle. I sometimes thought of standing my Tryal; for although I could not deny the Facts
            alledged in the several Articles, yet I hoped they would admit of some Extenuations. But having in my Life
            perused many State-Tryals, which I ever observed to terminate as the Judges thought fit to direct; I durst
            not rely on so dangerous a Decision, in so critical a Juncture, and against such powerful Enemies.* Once I
            was strongly bent upon Resistance: For while I had Liberty, the whole Strength of that Empire could hardly
            subdue me, and I might easily with Stones pelt the Metropolis to Pieces: But I soon rejected that Project
            with Horror, by remembering the Oath* I had made to the Emperor, the Favours I received from him, and the
            high Title of <em>Nardac</em> he conferred upon me. Neither had I so soon learned the Gratitude of
            Courtiers, to persuade myself that his Majesty&rsquo;s <em>present</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Severities acquitted me of all past Obligations.</em></p>
        <p>At last I fixed upon a Resolution, for which it is probable I may incur some Censure, and not unjustly; for I
            confess I owe the pre-serving mine Eyes, and consequently my Liberty, to my own great</p>

        <p>Rashness and Want of Experience: Because if I had then known the Nature of Princes and Ministers, which I
            have since observed in many other Courts, and their Methods of treating Criminals less obnoxious than
            myself; I should with great Alacrity and Readiness have submitted to so <em>easy</em> a Punishment. But
            hurried on by the Precipitancy of Youth; and having his Imperial Majesty&rsquo;s Licence to pay my
            Attendance upon the Emperor of <em>Blefuscu</em>; I took this Opportunity, before the three Days were
            elapsed, to send a Letter to my Friend the Secretary, signifying my Resolution of setting out that Morning
            for <em>Blefuscu</em>, pursuant to the Leave I had got; and without waiting for an Answer, I went to that
            Side of the Island where our Fleet lay. I seized a large Man of War, tied a Cable to the Prow, and lifting
            up the Anchors, I stript myself, put my Cloaths (together with my Coverlet, which I carryed under my Arm)
            into the Vessel; and drawing it after me, between wading and swimming, arrived at the Royal Port of
            <em>Blefuscu</em>, where the People had long expected me: They lent me two Guides to direct me to the
            Capital City, which is of the same Name; I held them in my Hands until I came within two Hundred Yards of
            the Gate; and desired them to signify my Arrival to one of the Secretaries, and let him know, I there waited
            his Majesty&rsquo;s Commands. I had an Answer in about an Hour, that his Majesty, attended by the Royal
            Family, and great Oﬃcers of the Court, was coming out to receive me. I advanced a Hundred Yards; the
            Emperor, and his Train, alighted from their Horses, the Empress and Ladies from their Coaches; and I did not
            perceive they were in any Fright or Concern. I lay on the Ground to kiss his Majesty&rsquo;s and the
            Empress&rsquo;s Hand. I told his Majesty, that I was come according to my Promise, and with the Licence of
            the Emperor my Master, to have the Honour of seeing so mighty a Monarch, and to oﬀer him any Service in my
            Power, consistent with my Duty to my own Prince; not mentioning a Word of my Disgrace, because I had
            hith-erto no regular Information of it, and might suppose myself wholly ignorant of any such Design; neither
            could I reasonably conceive that the Emperor would discover the Secret while I was out of his Power:
            Wherein, however, it soon appeared I was deceived.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I shall not trouble the Reader with the particular Account of my Reception at this Court, which was suitable
            to the Generosity of so great a Prince; nor of the Diﬃculties I was in for want of a House and Bed, being
            forced to lie on the Ground, wrapt up in my Coverlet.</p>

        <p><em>The Author, by a lucky Accident,</em><em> fi</em><em>nds Means to leave</em> Blefuscu<em>; and, after
                some Di</em><em>ﬃ</em><em>culties, returns safe to his Native Country.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h r e e days after my Arrival, walking out of Curiosity to the North-East Coast of the Island; I observed,
            about half a League oﬀ, in the Sea, somewhat that looked like a Boat overturned: I pulled oﬀ my Shoes and
            Stockings, and wading two or three Hundred Yards, I found the Object to approach nearer by Force of the
            Tide; and then plainly saw it to be a real Boat, which I supposed might, by some Tempest, have been driven
            from a Ship. Where-upon I returned immediately towards the City, and desired his Imperial Majesty to lend me
            Twenty of the tallest Vessels he had left after the Loss of his Fleet, and three Thousand Seamen under the
            Command of his Vice-Admiral. This Fleet sailed round, while I went back the shortest Way to the Coast where
            I first discovered the Boat; I found the Tide had driven it still nearer; the Seamen were all provided with
            Cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a suﬃcient Strength. When the Ships came up, I stript myself, and
            waded till I came within an Hundred Yards of the Boat; after which I was forced to swim till I got up to it.
            The Seamen threw me the End of the Cord, which I fastened to a Hole in the forepart of the Boat, and the
            other End to a Man of War: But I found all my Labour to little Purpose; for being out of my Depth, I was not
            able to work. In this Necessity, I was forced to swim behind, and push the Boat forwards as often as I
            could, with one of my Hands; and the Tide favouring me, I advanced so far, that I could just hold up my Chin
            and feel the Ground. I rested two or three Minutes, and then gave the Boat another Shove, and so on till the
            Sea was no higher than my Arm-pits. And now the most laborious Part being over, I took out my other Cables
            which were stowed in one of the Ships, and fastening them first to the Boat, and then to nine of the Vessels
            which attended me; the Wind being favourable, the Seamen towed, and I shoved till we arrived within forty
            Yards of the Shore; and waiting till the Tide was out, I got dry to the Boat, and by the Assistance of two
            Thousand Men, with Ropes and</p>

        <p>68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>Engines, I made a shift to turn it on its Bottom, and found it was but little damaged.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I shall not trouble the Reader with the Diﬃculties I was under by the Help of certain Paddles, which cost me
            ten Days making, to get my Boat to the Royal Port of <em>Blefuscu</em>; where a mighty Concourse of People
            appeared upon my Arrival, full of Wonder at the Sight of so prodigious a Vessel. I told the Emperor, that my
            good Fortune had thrown this Boat in my Way, to carry me to some Place from whence I might return into my
            native Country; and begged his Majesty&rsquo;s Orders for getting Materials to fit it up; together with his
            Licence to depart; which, after some kind Expostulations, he was pleased to grant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I did very much wonder, in all this Time, not to have heard of any Express relating to me from our Emperor to
            the Court of <em>Blefuscu</em>. But I was afterwards given privately to understand, that his Imperial
            Majesty, never imagining I had the least Notice of his Designs, believed I was only gone to
            <em>Blefuscu</em> in Performance of my Promise, according to the Licence he had given me, which was well
            known at our Court; and would return in a few Days when that Ceremony was ended. But he was at last in pain
            at my long absence; and, after consulting with the Treasurer, and the rest of that Cabal; a Person of
            Quality* was dispatched with the Copy of the Articles against me. This Envoy had Instructions to represent
            to the Monarch of <em>Blefuscu</em>, the great <em>Lenity</em> of his Master, who was content to punish me
            no further than with the Loss of mine Eyes: That I had fled from Justice, and if I did not return in two
            Hours, I should be deprived of my Title of <em>Nardac</em>, and declared a Traitor. The Envoy further added;
            that in order to maintain the Peace and Amity between both Empires, his Master expected, that his Brother of
            <em>Blefuscu</em> would give Orders to have me sent back to <em>Lilliput</em>, bound Hand and Foot, to be
            punished as a Traitor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Emperor of <em>Blefuscu</em> having taken three Days to consult, returned an Answer consisting of many
            Civilities and Excuses. He said, that as for sending me bound, his Brother knew it was Impos-sible; that
            although I had deprived him of his Fleet, yet he owed great Obligations to me for many good Oﬃces I had done
            him in making the Peace. That however, both their Majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a
            prodigious Vessel on the Shore, able to carry me on the Sea, which he had given order to fit up with my own

        <p>Assistance and Direction; and he hoped in a few Weeks both Empires would be freed from so insupportable an
            Incumbrance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With this Answer the Envoy returned to <em>Lilliput</em>, and the Monarch of <em>Blefuscu</em> related to me
            all that had past; oﬀering me at the same time (but under the strictest Confidence) his gracious
            Pro-tection, if I would continue in his Service; wherein although I believed him sincere, yet I resolved
            never more to put any Con-fidence in Princes or Ministers, where I could possibly avoid it; and therefore,
            with all due Acknowledgements for his favourable Inten-tions, I humbly begged to be excused. I told him,
            that since Fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a Vessel in my Way; I was resolved to venture myself in
            the Ocean, rather than be an Occasion of Diﬀerence between two such mighty Monarchs. Neither did I find the
            Emperor at all displeased; and I discovered by a certain Accident, that he was very glad of my Resolution,
            and so were most of his Ministers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These Considerations moved me to hasten my Departure somewhat sooner than I intended; to which the Court,
            impatient to have me gone, very readily contributed. Five hundred Workmen were employed to make two Sails to
            my Boat, according to my Direc-tions, by quilting thirteen fold of their strongest Linnen together. I was at
            the Pains of making Ropes and Cables, by twisting ten, twenty or thirty of the thickest and strongest of
            theirs. A great Stone that I happened to find, after a long Search by the Sea-shore, served me for an
            Anchor. I had the Tallow of three hundred Cows for greasing my Boat, and other Uses. I was at incredible
            Pains in cutting down some of the largest Timber Trees for Oars and Masts, wherein I was, however, much
            assisted by his Majesty&rsquo;s Ship-Carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them, after I had done the rough
            Work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In about a Month, when all was prepared. I sent to receive his Majesty&rsquo;s Commands, and to take my
            leave. The Emperor and Royal Family came out of the Palace: I lay down on my Face to kiss his Hand, which he
            very graciously gave me; so did the Empress, and young Princes of the Blood. His Majesty presented me with
            fifty Purses of two hundred <em>Sprugs</em> a-piece, together with his Picture at full length, which I put
            immediately into one of my Gloves, to keep it from being hurt. The Ceremonies at my Departure were too many
            to trouble the Reader with at this time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I stored the Boat with the Carcasses of an hundred Oxen, and three hundred Sheep, with Bread and Drink
            proportionable, and as much Meat ready dressed as four hundred Cooks could provide. I took with me six Cows
            and two Bulls alive, with as many Yews and Rams, intending to carry them into my own Country, and propagate
            the Breed. And to feed them on board, I had a good Bundle of Hay, and a Bag of Corn. I would gladly have
            taken a Dozen of the Natives; but this was a thing the Emperor would by no Means permit; and besides a
            diligent Search into my Pockets, his Majesty engaged my Honour not to carry away any of his Subjects,
            although with their own Consent and Desire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able; I set sail on the Twenty-fourth Day of
            <em>September</em> 1701, at six in the Morning; and when I had gone about four Leagues to the Northward, the
            Wind being at South-East; at six in the Evening, I descryed a small Island about half a League to the North
            West. I advanced forward, and cast Anchor on the Lee-side of the Island, which seemed to be uninhabited. I
            then took some Refreshment, and went to my Rest. I slept well, and as I conjecture at least six Hours; for I
            found the Day broke in two Hours after I awaked. It was a clear Night; I eat my Breakfast before the Sun was
            up; and heaving Anchor, the Wind being favourable, I steered the same Course that I had done the Day before,
            wherein I was directed by my Pocket-Compass. My Intention was to reach, if possible, one of those Islands,
            which I had reason to believe lay to the North-East of <em>Van Diemen</em>&rsquo;s Land. I discovered
            nothing all that Day; but upon the next, about three in the After-noon, when I had by my Computation made
            Twenty-four Leagues from <em>Blefuscu</em>, I descryed a Sail steering to the South-East; my Course was due
            East. I hailed her, but could get no Answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the Wind slackened. I made
            all the Sail I could, and in half an Hour she spyed me, then hung out her Antient,* and discharged a Gun. It
            is not easy to express the joy I was in upon the unexpected Hope of once more seeing my beloved Country, and
            the dear Pledges I had left in it. The Ship slackned her Sails, and I came up with her between five and six
            in the Evening, <em>September</em> 26; but my Heart leapt within me to see her <em>English</em> Colours. I
            put my Cows and Sheep into my Coat-Pockets, and got on board with all my little Cargo of Provisions. The
            Vessel was an <em>English</em> Merchant-man, returning from <em>Japan</em> by the <em>North</em> and</p>

        <p><em>South Seas</em>;* the Captain, Mr <em>John Biddel</em> of <em>Deptford</em>, a very civil Man, and an
            excellent Sailor. We were now in the Latitude of 30 Degrees South; there were about fifty Men in the Ship;
            and here I met an old Comrade of mine, one <em>Peter Williams</em>, who gave me a good Character to the
            Captain. This Gentleman treated me with Kindness, and desired I would let him know what Place I came from
            last, and whither I was bound; which I did in few Words; but he thought I was raving, and that the Dangers I
            underwent had dis-turbed my Head; whereupon I took my black Cattle and Sheep out of my Pocket, which, after
            great Astonishment, clearly convinced him of my Veracity.* I then shewed him the Gold given me by the
            Emperor of <em>Blefuscu</em>, together with his Majesty&rsquo;s Picture at full Length, and some other
            Rarities of that Country. I gave him two Purses of two Hundred <em>Sprugs</em> each, and promised, when we
            arrived in <em>England</em>, to make him a Present of a Cow and a Sheep big with Young.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I shall not trouble the Reader with a particular Account of this Voyage, which was very prosperous for the
            most Part. We arrived in the <em>Downs</em>* on the 13th of <em>April</em> 1702. I had only one Misfortune,
            that the Rats on board carried away one of my Sheep; I found her Bones in a Hole, picked clean from the
            Flesh. The rest of my Cattle I got safe on Shore, and set them a grazing in a Bowling-Green at
            <em>Greenwich</em>, where the Fineness of the Grass made them feed very heartily, although I had always
            feared the contrary: Neither could I possibly have preserved them in so long a Voyage, if the Captain had
            not allowed me some of his best Bisket, which rubbed to Powder, and mingled with Water, was their constant
            Food. The short Time I continued in <em>England</em>, I made a considerable Profit by shewing my Cattle to
            many Persons of Quality, and others: And before I began my second Voyage, I sold them for six Hundred
            Pounds. Since my last Return, I find the Breed is considerably increased, especially the Sheep; which I hope
            will prove much to the Advantage of the Woollen Manufacture, by the Fineness of the Fleeces.*</p>

        <p>l stayed two Months with my Wife and Family; for my insatiable Desire of seeing foreign Countries* would
            suﬀer me to continue no longer. I left fifteen Hundred Pounds with my Wife, and fixed her in a good House at
            <em>Redri</em><em>ﬀ</em>. My remaining Stock I carried with me, Part in Money, and Part in Goods, in Hopes
            to improve my Fortunes. My eldest Uncle, <em>John</em>, had left me an Estate in Land, near <em>Epping</em>,

            yielded me as much more: So that I was not in any Danger of leaving my Family upon the Parish.* My Son
            <em>Johnny</em>, named so after his Uncle, was at the Grammar School, and a towardly* Child. My Daughter
            <em>Betty</em> (who is now well married, and has Children) was then at her Needle-Work. I took Leave of my
            Wife, and Boy and Girl, with Tears on both Sides; and went on board the <em>Adventure</em>,* a Merchant-Ship
            of three Hundred Tons, bound for <em>Surat</em>,* Captain <em>John Nicholas</em> of <em>Liverpool</em>,

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>H av i n g b e e n condemned by Nature and Fortune to an active and restless Life; in two Months after my
            Return, I again left my native Country, and took Shipping in the <em>Downs</em> on the 20th Day of
            <em>June</em>, 1702, in the <em>Adventure</em>, Capt. <em>John Nicholas</em>, a <em>Cornish</em> Man,
            Commander, bound for <em>Surat</em>. We had a very prosperous Gale till we arrived at the <em>Cape</em> of
            <em>Good-hope</em>,* where we landed for fresh Water; but discovering a Leak we unshipped our Goods, and
            wintered there; for the Captain falling sick of an Ague, we could not leave the <em>Cape</em> till the End
            of <em>March</em>. We then set sail, and had a good Voyage till we passed the <em>Streights of
                Madagascar</em>; but having got North-ward of that Island, and to about five Degrees South Latitude, the
            Winds, which in those Seas are observed to blow a constant equal Gale between the North and West, from the
            Beginning of <em>December</em> to the Beginning of <em>May</em>, on the 19th of <em>April</em> began to blow
            with much greater Violence, and more Westerly than usual; continuing so for twenty Days together, during
            which time we were driven a little to the East of the <em>Molucca</em> Islands, and about three Degrees
            Northward of the Line, as our Captain found by an Observation he took the 2d of <em>May</em>, at which time
            the Wind ceased, and it was a perfect Calm, whereat I was not a little rejoyced. But he being a Man well
            experienced in the Navigation of those Seas, bid us all prepare against a Storm, which accordingly happened
            the Day following: For a Southern Wind, called the Southern <em>Monsoon</em>,* began to set in.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Finding it was like to overblow,* we took in our Sprit-sail,* and stood by to hand* the Fore-sail; but
            making* foul Weather, we looked the Guns were all fast,* and handed the Missen.* The Ship lay very broad
            oﬀ,* so we thought it better spooning* before the Sea, than trying* or hulling.* We reeft the Foresail and
            set him, we hawled aft the Fore-sheet;* the Helm was hard a Weather.* The Ship wore*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>76&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>bravely. We belay&rsquo;d the Foredown-hall;* but the Sail was split, and we hawl&rsquo;d down the Yard,* and
            got the Sail into the Ship, and unbound all the things clear of it. It was a very fierce Storm; the Sea
            broke strange and dangerous.* We hawl&rsquo;d oﬀ upon the Lanniard of the Wipstaﬀ,* and helped the Man at
            Helm. We would not get down our Top-Mast, but let all stand, because She scudded before the Sea very well,*
            and we knew that the Top-Mast being aloft, the Ship was the wholesomer,* and made better way through the
            Sea, seeing we had Sea room. When the Storm was over, we set Fore-sail and Main-sail, and brought the Ship
            to.* Then we set the Missen, Maintop-Sail and the Foretop-Sail. Our Course was East North-east, the Wind was
            at South-West. We got the Star-board Tacks aboard,* we cast oﬀ our Weather-braces and Lifts;* we set in the
            Lee-braces,* and hawl&rsquo;d for-ward by the Weather-bowlings,* and hawl&rsquo;d them tight, and belayed
            them, and hawl&rsquo;d over the Missen Tack to Windward, and kept her full and by as near as she would lye.*
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During this Storm, which was followed by a strong Wind West South-west, we were carried by my Computation
            about five hundred Leagues to the East, so that the oldest Sailor on Board could not tell in what part of
            the World we were. Our Provisions held out well, our Ship was staunch, and our Crew all in good Health; but
            we lay in the utmost Distress for Water. We thought it best to hold on the same Course rather than turn more
            Northerly, which might have brought us to the North-west Parts of the great <em>Tartary</em>, and into the
            frozen Sea.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the 16<em>th</em> Day of <em>June</em>, 1703, a Boy on the Top-mast discovered Land. On the 17<em>th</em>
            we came in full View of a great Island or Contin-ent, (for we knew not whether*) on the South-side whereof
            was a small Neck of Land jutting out into the Sea, and a Creek too shallow to hold a Ship of above one
            hundred Tuns. We cast Anchor within a League of this Creek, and our Captain sent a dozen of his Men well
            armed in the Long Boat, with Vessels for Water if any could be found. I desired his leave to go with them,
            that I might see the Country, and make what Discoveries I could. When we came to Land we saw no River or
            Spring, nor any Sign of Inhabitants. Our Men therefore wandered on the Shore to find out some fresh Water
            near the Sea, and I walked alone about a Mile on the other side, where I observed the Country all barren and
            rocky. I now began to be weary, and seeing nothing to entertain my Curiosity, I returned</p>

        <p>gently down towards the Creek; and the Sea being full in my View, I saw our Men already got into the Boat,
            and rowing for Life to the Ship. I was going to hollow* after them, although it had been to little purpose,
            when I observed a huge Creature walking after them in the Sea,* as fast as he could: He waded not much
            deeper than his Knees, and took prodigious strides: But our Men had the start of him half a League, and the
            Sea thereabouts being full of sharp pointed Rocks, the Monster was not able to overtake the Boat. This I was
            afterwards told, for I durst not stay to see the Issue of that Adventure; but ran as fast as I could the Way
            I first went; and then climbed up a steep Hill, which gave me some Prospect of the Country. I found it fully
            culti-vated; but that which first surprised me was the Length of the Grass, which in those Grounds that
            seemed to be kept for Hay, was about twenty Foot high.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I fell into a high Road, for so I took it to be, although it served to the Inhabitants only as a foot Path
            through a Field of Barley. Here I walked on for sometime, but could see little on either Side, it being now
            near Harvest, and the Corn rising at least forty Foot. I was an Hour walking to the end of this Field, which
            was fenced in with a Hedge of at least one hundred and twenty Foot high, and the Trees so lofty that I could
            make no Computation of their Altitude. There was a Stile to pass from this Field into the next: It had four
            Steps, and a Stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost. It was impossible for me to climb this
            Stile, because every Step was six Foot high, and the upper Stone above twenty. I was endeavouring to find
            some Gap in the Hedge; when I discovered one of the Inhabitants in the next Field advancing towards the
            Stile, of the same Size with him whom I saw in the Sea pursuing our Boat. He appeared as Tall as an ordinary
            Spire-steeple; and took about ten Yards at every Stride,* as near as I could guess. I was struck with the
            utmost Fear and Astonishment, and ran to hide my self in the Corn, from whence I saw him at the Top of the
            Stile, looking back into the next Field on the right Hand; and heard him call in a Voice many Degrees louder
            than a speaking Trumpet; but the Noise was so High in the Air, that at first I certainly thought it was
            Thunder. Whereupon seven Monsters like himself came towards him with Reaping-Hooks in their Hands, each Hook
            about the largeness of six Scythes. These People were not so well clad as the first, whose Servants or
            Labour-ers they seemed to be. For, upon some Words he spoke, they went to</p>

        <p>reap the Corn in the Field where I lay. I kept from them at as great a Distance as I could, but was forced to
            move with extream Diﬃculty; for the Stalks of the Corn were sometimes not above a Foot distant, so that I
            could hardly squeeze my Body betwixt them. However, I made a shift to go forward till I came to a part of
            the Field where the Corn had been laid by the Rain and Wind: Here it was impossible for me to advance a
            step; for the Stalks were so interwoven that I could not creep through, and the Beards of the fallen Ears so
            strong and pointed, that they pierced through my Cloaths into my Flesh. At the same time I heard the Reapers
            not above an hundred Yards behind me. Being quite dispirited with Toil, and wholly overcome by Grief and
            Despair, I lay down between two Ridges, and heartily wished I might there end my Days. I bemoaned my
            desolate Widow, and Fatherless Children: I lamented my own Folly and Wilfulness in attempting a second
            Voyage against the Advice of all my Friends and Relations. In this terrible Agitation of Mind I could not
            forbear thinking of <em>Lilliput</em>, whose Inhabitants looked upon me as the great-est Prodigy that ever
            appeared in the World; where I was able to draw an Imperial Fleet in my Hand, and perform those other
            Actions which will be recorded for ever in the Chronicles of that Empire, while Posterity shall hardly
            believe them, although attested by Millions. I reflected what a Mortification it must prove to me to appear
            as inconsiderable in this Nation, as one single <em>Lilliputian</em> would be among us. But, this I
            conceived was to be the least of my Misfortunes: For, as human Creatures are observed to be more Savage and
            cruel in Proportion to their Bulk;* what could I expect but to be a Morsel in the Mouth of the first among
            these enormous Barbarians that should happen to seize me? Undoubtedly Philo-sophers* are in the Right when
            they tell us, that nothing is great or little otherwise than by Comparison: It might have pleased Fortune to
            let the <em>Lilliputians</em> find some Nation, where the People were as diminutive with respect to them, as
            they were to me. And who knows but that even this prodigious Race of Mortals might be equally overmatched in
            some distant Part of the World, whereof we have yet no Discovery?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Scared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these Reflections; when one of the Reapers
            approaching within ten Yards of the Ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next Step I should be
            squashed to Death under his Foot, or cut in</p>

        <p>two with his Reaping Hook. And therefore when he was again about to move, I screamed as loud as Fear could
            make me. Whereupon the huge Creature trod short, and looking round about under him for some time, at last
            espied me as I lay on the Ground. He considered a while with the Caution of one who endeavours to lay hold
            on a small dangerous Animal in such a Manner that it shall not be able either to scratch or to bite him; as
            I my self have sometimes done with a <em>Weasel</em> in <em>England</em>. At length he ventured to take me
            up behind by the middle between his Fore-finger and Thumb, and brought me within three Yards of his Eyes,
            that he might behold my Shape more perfectly. I guessed his Meaning; and my good Fortune gave me so much
            Presence of Mind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the Air about sixty Foot
            from the Ground; although he grievously pinched my Sides, for fear I should slip through his Fingers. All I
            ventured was to raise my Eyes towards the Sun, and place my Hands together in a supplicating Posture, and to
            speak some Words in a humble melancholy Tone, suitable to the Condition I then was in. For, I apprehended
            every Moment that he would dash me against the Ground, as we usually do any little hateful Animal which we
            have a Mind to Destroy. But my good Star would have it, that he appeared pleased with my Voice and Gestures,
            and began to look upon me as a Curiosity; much wondering to hear me pronounce articulate Words, although he
            could not understand them. In the mean time I was not able to forbear Groaning and shedding Tears, and
            turning my Head towards my Sides; letting him know, as well as I could, how cruelly I was hurt by the
            Pressure of his Thumb and Finger. He seemed to apprehend my Meaning; for, lifting up the Lappet* of his
            Coat, he put me gently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his Master, who was a substantial
            Farmer, and the same Person I had first seen in the Field.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Farmer having (as I supposed by their Talk) received such an Account of me as his Servant could give him,
            took a piece of a small Straw, about the Size of a walking Staﬀ, and therewith lifted up the Lappets of my
            Coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of Covering that Nature had given me. He blew my Hairs aside
            to take a better View of my Face. He called his Hinds* about him, and asked them (as I afterwards learned)
            whether they had ever seen in the Fields any little Creature that resembled me. He then placed me softly on
            the Ground upon all four; but I got immediately up, and</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>walked slowly backwards and forwards, to let those People see I had no Intent to run away. They all sate down
            in a Circle about me, the better to observe my Motions. I pulled oﬀ my Hat, and made a low Bow towards the
            Farmer. I fell on my Knees, and lifted up my Hands and Eyes, and spoke several Words as loud as I could: I
            took a Purse of Gold out of my Pocket, and humbly presented it to him. He received it on the Palm of his
            Hand, then applied it close to his Eye, to see what it was, and afterwards turned it several times with the
            Point of a Pin (which he took out of his Sleeve,) but could make nothing of it. Whereupon I made a Sign that
            he should place his Hand on the Ground: I then took the Purse, and opening it, poured all the Gold into his
            Palm. There were six <em>Spanish</em>-Pieces of four Pistoles* each, besides twenty or thirty smaller Coins.
            I saw him wet the Tip of his little Finger upon his Tongue, and take up one of my largest Pieces, and then
            another; but he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were. He made me a Sign to put them again into my
            Purse, and the Purse again into my Pocket; which after oﬀering to him several times, I thought it best to
            do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Farmer by this time was convinced I must be a rational Creature. He spoke often to me, but the Sound of
            his Voice pierced my Ears like that of a Water-Mill;* yet his Words were articulate enough. I answered as
            loud as I could in several Languages; and he often laid his Ear within two Yards of me, but all in vain, for
            we were wholly unintelligible to each other. He then sent his Servants to their Work, and taking his
            Handkerchief out of his Pocket, he doubled and spread it on his Hand, which he placed flat on the Ground
            with the Palm upwards, making me a Sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for it was not above a Foot
            in thickness. I thought it my part to obey; and for fear of falling, laid myself at full Length upon the
            Handkerchief, with the Remainder of which he lapped me up to the Head for further Security; and in this
            Manner carried me home to his House. There he called his Wife, and shewed me to her; but she screamed and
            ran back as Women in <em>England</em> do at the Sight of a Toad or a Spider. However, when she had a while
            seen my Behaviour, and how well I observed the Signs her Husband made, she was soon reconciled, and by
            Degrees grew extremely tender of me.</p>

        <p>an Husband-Man) in a Dish of about four and twenty Foot Diameter. The Company were the Farmer and his Wife,
            three Children, and an old Grandmother: When they were sat down, the Farmer placed me at some Distance from
            him on the Table, which was thirty Foot high from the Floor. I was in a terrible Fright, and kept as far as
            I could from the Edge, for fear of falling. The Wife minced a bit of Meat, then crumbled some Bread on a
            Trencher, and placed it before me. I made her a low Bow, took out my Knife and Fork, and fell to eat; which
            gave them exceeding Delight. The Mistress sent her Maid for a small Dram-cup, which held about two Gallons,
            and filled it with Drink: I took up the Vessel with much diﬃculty in both Hands, and in a most respectful
            Manner drank to her Ladyship&rsquo;s Health, expressing the Words as loud as I could in <em>English</em>;
            which made the Company laugh so heartily, that I was almost deafened with the Noise. This Liquor tasted like
            a small Cyder, and was not unpleasant. Then the Master made me a Sign to come to his Trencher side; but as I
            walked on the Table, being in great surprize* all the time, as the indulgent Reader will easily conceive and
            excuse, I happened to stumble against a Crust, and fell flat on my Face, but received no hurt. I got up
            immediately, and observing the good People to be in much Concern, I took my Hat (which I held under my Arm
            out of good Manners) and waving it over my Head, made three Huzza&rsquo;s, to shew I had got no Mischief by
            the Fall. But advancing forwards toward my Master (as I shall henceforth call him) his youngest Son who sate
            next to him, an arch* Boy of about ten Years old, took me up by the Legs, and held me so high in the Air,
            that I trembled every Limb; but his Father snatched me from him; and at the same time gave him such a Box on
            the left Ear, as would have felled an <em>European</em> Troop of Horse to the Earth; ordering him to be
            taken from the Table. But, being afraid the Boy might owe me a Spight; and well remembering how mischievous
            all Children among us naturally are to Sparrows, Rabbits, young Kittens, and Puppy-Dogs; I fell on my Knees,
            and pointing to the Boy, made my Master to understand, as well as I could, that I desired his Son might be
            pardoned. The Father complied, and the Lad took his seat again; whereupon I went to him and kissed his Hand,
            which my Master took, and made him stroak me gently with it.</p>

        <p>In the Midst of Dinner my Mistress&rsquo;s favourite Cat leapt into her Lap. I heard a Noise behind me like

        <p>Stocking-Weavers* at work; and turning my Head, I found it pro-ceeded from the Purring of this Animal, who
            seemed to be three Times larger than an Ox, as I computed by the View of her Head, and one of her Paws,
            while her Mistress was feeding and stroking her. The Fierceness of this Creature&rsquo;s Countenance
            altogether dis-composed me; although I stood at the further End of the Table, above fifty Foot oﬀ; and
            although my Mistress held her fast for fear she might give a Spring, and seize me in her Talons. But it
            happened there was no Danger; for the Cat took not the least Notice of me when my Master placed me within
            three Yards of her. And as I have been always told, and found true by Experience in my Travels, that flying,
            or discovering Fear before a fierce Animal, is a certain Way to make it pursue or attack you; so I resolved
            in this dangerous Juncture to shew no Manner of Concern. I walked with Intrepidity five or six Times before
            the very Head of the Cat, and came within half a Yard of her; whereupon she drew her self back, as if she
            were more afraid of me: I had less Apprehension concerning the Dogs, whereof three or four came into the
            Room, as it is usual in Farmers Houses; one of which was a Mastiﬀ equal in Bulk to four Elephants, and a
            Grey-hound, somewhat taller than the Mastiﬀ, but not so large.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Dinner was almost done, the Nurse came in with a Child of a Year old in her Arms; who immediately spied
            me, and began a Squall that you might have heard from <em>London-Bridge</em> to <em>Chelsea</em>; after the
            usual Oratory of Infants, to get me for a Play-thing. The Mother out of pure Indulgence took me up, and put
            me towards the Child, who presently seized me by the Middle, and got my Head in his Mouth, where I roared so
            loud that the Urchin was frighted, and let me drop; and I should infallibly have broken my Neck, if the
            Mother had not held her Apron under me. The Nurse to quiet her Babe made use of a Rattle, which was a Kind
            of hollow Vessel filled with great Stones, and fastned by a Cable to the Child&rsquo;s Waist: But all in
            vain, so that she was forced to apply the last Remedy by giving it suck. I must confess no Object ever
            disgusted me so much as the Sight of her monstrous Breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as
            to give the curious Reader an Idea of its Bulk, Shape and Colour. It stood prominent six Foot, and could not
            be less than sixteen in Circumference. The Nipple was about half the Bigness of my Head, and the Hue both of
            that and the Dug so varified with Spots, Pimples and Freckles, that nothing could appear more</p>

        <p>nauseous: For I had a near Sight of her, she sitting down the more conveniently to give Suck, and I standing
            on the Table. This made me reflect upon the fair Skins of our <em>English</em> Ladies, who appear so
            beautiful to us, only because they are of our own Size, and their Defects not to be seen but through a
            magnifying Glass,* where we find by Experiment that the smoothest and whitest Skins look rough and coarse,
            and ill coloured.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I remember when I was at <em>Lilliput</em>, the Complexions of those diminutive People appeared to me the
            fairest in the World: And talking upon this Subject with a Person of Learning there, who was an intimate
            Friend of mine; he said, that my Face appeared much fairer and smoother when he looked on me from the
            Ground, than it did upon a nearer View when I took him up in my Hand, and brought him close; which he
            confessed was at first a very shocking Sight. He said, he could discover great Holes in my Skin; that the
            Stumps of my Beard were ten Times stronger than the Bristles of a Boar; and my Complexion made up of several
            Colours altogether disagreeable: Although I must beg Leave to say for my self, that I am as fair as most of
            my Sex and Country, and very little Sunburnt by all my Travels. On the other Side, discoursing of the Ladies
            in that Emperor&rsquo;s Court, he used to tell me, one had Freckles, another too wide a Mouth, a third too
            large a Nose; nothing of which I was able to distinguish. I confess this Reflection was obvious enough;
            which, however, I could not forbear, lest the Reader might think those vast Creatures were actually
            deformed: For I must do them Justice to say they are a comely Race of People; and particularly the Features
            of my Master&rsquo;s Countenance, although he were but a Farmer, when I beheld him from the Height of sixty
            Foot, appeared very well proportioned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Dinner was done, my Master went out to his Labourers; and as I could discover by his Voice and Gesture,
            gave his Wife a strict Charge to take Care of me. I was very much tired and disposed to sleep, which my
            Mistress perceiving, she put me on her own Bed, and covered me with a clean white Handkerchief, but larger
            and coarser than the Main Sail of a Man of War.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I slept about two Hours, and dreamed I was at home with my Wife and Children, which aggravated my Sorrows
            when I awakened and found my self alone in a vast Room, between two and three Hundred Foot wide, and above
            two Hundred high; lying in a Bed twenty Yards</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>84&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>wide. My Mistress was gone about her household Aﬀairs, and had locked me in. The Bed was eight Yards from the
            Floor. Some natural Necessities required me to get down: I durst not presume to call, and if I had, it would
            have been in vain with such a Voice as mine at so great a Distance from the Room where I lay, to the Kitchen
            where the Family kept. While I was under these Circumstances, two Rats* crept up the Curtains, and ran
            Smelling backwards and forwards on the Bed: One of them came up almost to my Face; whereupon I rose in a
            Fright, and drew out my Hanger* to defend my self. These horrible Animals had the Boldness to attack me on
            both Sides, and one of them held his Fore-feet at my Collar; but I had the good fortune to rip up his Belly
            before he could do me any Mischief. He fell down at my Feet; and the other seeing the Fate of his Comrade,
            made his Escape, but not without one good Wound on the Back, which I gave him as he fled, and made the Blood
            run trickling from him. After this Exploit I walked gently to and fro on the Bed, to recover my Breath and
            Loss of Spirits. These Creatures were of the Size of a large Mastiﬀ, but infinitely more nimble and fierce;
            so that if I had taken oﬀ my Belt before I went to sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to Pieces and
            devoured. I measured the Tail of the dead Rat, and found it to be two Yards long, wanting an Inch; but it
            went against my Stomach to drag the Carcass oﬀ the Bed, where it lay still bleeding; I observed it had yet
            some Life, but with a strong Slash cross the Neck, I thoroughly dispatched it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soon after, my Mistress came into the Room, who seeing me all bloody, ran and took me up in her Hand. I
            pointed to the dead <em>Rat</em>, smiling and making other Signs to shew I was not hurt; whereat she was
            extremely rejoyced, calling the Maid to take up the dead <em>Rat</em> with a Pair of Tongs, and throw it out
            of the Window. Then she set me on a Table, where I shewed her my Hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the
            Lappet of my Coat, returned it to the Scabbard. I was pressed to do more than one Thing, which another could
            not do for me; and therefore endeavoured to make my Mistress understand that I desired to be set down on the
            Floor; which after she had done, my Bashfulness would not suﬀer me to express my self farther than by
            pointing to the Door, and bowing several Times. The good Woman with much Diﬃculty at last perceived what I
            would be at; and taking me up again in her Hand, walked into the Garden, where she set me down. I went on
            one Side about two Hundred Yards; and beckoning</p>

            sole Design in presenting this and other Accounts of my Travels to the World;* wherein I have been chiefly
            studious of Truth, without aﬀecting any Ornaments of Learning, or of Style.* But the whole Scene of this
            Voyage made so strong an Impression on my Mind, and is so deeply fixed in my Memory, that in committing it
            to Paper, I did not omit one material Circumstance: However, upon a strict Review, I blotted out several
            Passages of less Moment which were in my first Copy, for fear of being censured as tedious and trifling,

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>M y mistress had a daughter of nine Years old, a Child of towardly Parts* for her Age, very dextrous at her
            Needle, and skilful in dress-ing her Baby.* Her Mother and she contrived to fit up the Baby&rsquo;s Cradle
            for me against Night: The Cradle was put into a small Drawer of a Cabinet, and the Drawer placed upon a
            hanging Shelf for fear of the <em>Rats</em>. This was my Bed all the Time I stayed with those People,
            although made more convenient by Degrees, as I began to learn their Language, and make my Wants known. This
            young Girl was so handy, that after I had once or twice pulled oﬀ my Cloaths before her, she was able to
            dress and undress me, although I never gave her that Trouble when she would let me do either my self.* She
            made me seven Shirts, and some other Linnen of as fine Cloth as could be got, which indeed was coarser than
            Sackcloth; and these she constantly washed for me with her own Hands. She was likewise my School-Mistress to
            teach me the Language: When I pointed to any thing, she told me the Name of it in her own Tongue, so that in
            a few Days I was able to call for whatever I had a mind to. She was very good natured, and not above forty
            Foot high, being little for her Age. She gave me the Name of <em>Grildrig</em>, which the Family took up,
            and afterwards the whole Kingdom. The Word imports what the <em>Latins</em> call <em>Nanunculus</em>,* the
            <em>Italians Homunceletino</em>,* and the <em>English Mannikin</em>. To her I chiefly owe my Preservation in
            that Country: We never parted while I was there; I called her my <em>Glumdalclitch</em>,* or little Nurse:
            And I should be guilty of great Ingratitude if I omitted this honourable Mention of her Care and Aﬀection
            towards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my Power to requite as she deserves, instead of being the
            innocent but unhappy Instrument of her Disgrace, as I have too much Reason to fear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It now began to be known and talked of in the Neighbourhood, that my Master had found a strange Animal in the
            Field, about the Bigness of a <em>Splacknuck</em>, but exactly shaped in every Part like a human Creature;
            which it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed</p>

        <p>to speak in a little Language* of its own, had already learned several Words of theirs, went erect upon two
            Legs, was tame and gentle, would come when it was called, do whatever it was bid, had the finest Limbs in
            the World, and a Complexion fairer than a Nobleman&rsquo;s Daughter of three Years old. Another Farmer who
            lived hard by, and was a particular Friend of my Master, came on a Visit on Purpose to enquire into the
            Truth of this Story. I was immediately produced, and placed upon a Table; where I walked as I was commanded,
            drew my Hanger, put it up again, made my Reverence to my Master&rsquo;s Guest, asked him in his own Language
            how he did, and told him he was welcome; just as my little Nurse had instructed me. This Man, who was old
            and dim-sighted, put on his Spectacles to behold me better, at which I could not forbear laughing very
            heartily; for his Eyes appeared like the Full-Moon shining into a Chamber at two Windows. Our People, who
            discovered the Cause of my Mirth, bore me Company in Laughing; at which the old Fellow was Fool enough to be
            angry and out of Countenance. He had the Character of a great Miser; and to my Misfortune he well deserved
            it by the cursed Advice he gave my Master, to shew me as a Sight upon a Market-Day in the next Town, which
            was half an Hour&rsquo;s Riding, about two and twenty Miles from our House. I guessed there was some
            Mischief contriving, when I observed my Master and his Friend whispering long together, sometimes pointing
            at me; and my Fears made me Fancy that I overheard and understood some of their Words. But, the next Morning
            <em>Glumdalclitch</em> my little Nurse told me the whole Matter, which she had cunningly picked out from her
            Mother. The poor Girl laid me on her Bosom, and fell a weeping with Shame and Grief. She apprehended some
            Mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar Folks, who might Squeeze me to Death, or break one of my Limbs
            by taking me in their Hands. She had also observed how modest I was in my Nature, how nicely I regarded my
            Honour; and what an Indignity I should conceive it to be exposed for Money as a publick Spectacle to the
            meanest of the People. She said, her <em>Papa</em> and <em>Mamma</em> had promised that <em>Grildrig</em>
            should be hers; but now she found they meant to serve her as they did last Year, when they pretended to give
            her a Lamb; and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a Butcher. For my own Part, I may truly aﬃrm that I
            was less concerned than my Nurse. I had a strong Hope which never left me, that I should one Day recover my
            Liberty;</p>

        <p>and as to the Ignominy of being carried about for a Monster,* I considered my self to be a perfect Stranger
            in the Country; and that such a Misfortune could never be charged upon me as a Reproach if ever I should
            return to <em>England</em>; since the King of <em>Great Britain</em> himself, in my Condition, must have
            undergone the same Distress.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Master, pursuant to the Advice of his Friend, carried me in a Box* the next Market-Day to the neighbouring
            Town; and took along with him his little Daughter my Nurse upon a Pillion behind him. The Box was close* on
            every Side, with a little Door for me to go in and out, and a few Gimlet-holes to let in Air. The Girl had
            been so careful to put the Quilt of her Baby&rsquo;s Bed into it, for me to lye down on. However, I was
            terribly shaken and discomposed in this Journey, although it were but of half an Hour. For the Horse went
            about forty Foot at every Step; and trotted so high, that the Agitation was equal to the rising and falling
            of a Ship in a great Storm, but much more frequent: Our Journey was somewhat further than from
            <em>London</em> to St <em>Albans</em>.* My Master alighted at an Inn which he used to frequent; and after
            consulting a while with the Inn-keeper, and making some necessary Preparations, he hired the
            <em>Grultrud</em>, or Cryer, to give Notice through the Town, of a strange Creature to be seen at the Sign
            of the Green <em>Eagle</em>,* not so big as a <em>Splacknuck</em>, (an Animal in that Country very finely
            shaped, about six Foot long) and in every Part of the Body resembling an human Creature; could speak several
            Words, and perform a Hundred diverting Tricks.</p>
        <p>I was placed upon a Table in the largest Room of the Inn, which might be near three Hundred Foot square. My
            little Nurse stood on a low Stool close to the Table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do. My
            Master, to avoid a Croud, would suﬀer only Thirty People at a Time to see me. I walked about on the Table as
            the Girl commanded; she asked me Questions as far as she knew my Under-standing of the Language reached, and
            I answered them as loud as I could. I turned about several Times to the Company, paid my humble Respects,
            said they were welcome; and used some other Speeches I had been taught. I took up a Thimble filled with
            Liquor, which <em>Glumdalclitch</em> had given me for a Cup, and drank their Health. I drew out my Hanger,
            and flourished it after the Manner of Fencers in <em>England</em>. My Nurse gave me part of a Straw, which I
            exercised as a Pike, having learned the Art in my Youth. I was that Day shewn to</p>

        <p>twelve Sets of Company; and as often forced to go over again with the same Fopperies,* till I was half dead
            with Weariness and Vexation. For, those who had seen me, made such wonderful Reports, that the People were
            ready to break down the Doors to come in. My Master for his own Interest would not suﬀer any one to touch
            me, except my Nurse; and, to prevent Danger, Benches were set around the Table at such a Distance, as put me
            out of every Body&rsquo;s Reach. However, an unlucky* School-Boy aimed a Hazel Nut directly at my Head,
            which very narrowly missed me; otherwise, it came with so much Violence, that it would have infallibly
            knocked out my Brains; for it was almost as large as a small Pumpion:* But I had the Satisfaction to see the
            young Rogue well beaten, and turned out of the Room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Master gave publick Notice, that he would shew me again the next Market-Day: And in the mean time, he
            prepared a more con-venient Vehicle for me, which he had Reason enough to do; for I was so tired with my
            first Journey, and with entertaining Company for eight Hours together, that I could hardly stand upon my
            Legs, or speak a Word. It was at least three Days before I recovered my Strength; and that I might have no
            rest at home, all the neighbouring Gentlemen from a Hundred Miles round, hearing of my Fame, came to see me
            at my Master&rsquo;s own House. There could not be fewer than thirty Persons with their Wives and Children;
            (for the Country is very populous;) and my Master demanded the Rate of a full Room whenever he shewed me at
            Home, although it were only to a single Family. So that for some time I had but little Ease every Day of the
            Week, (except <em>Wednesday</em>, which is their Sabbath) although I were not carried to the Town.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Master finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to carry me to the most considerable Cities of
            the Kingdom. Having therefore provided himself with all things necessary for a long Journey, and settled his
            Aﬀairs at Home; he took Leave of his Wife, and upon the 17<em>th</em> of <em>August</em> 1703, about two
            Months after my Arrival, we set out for the Metropolis, situated near the Middle of that Empire, and about
            three Thousand Miles distance from our House: My Master made his Daughter <em>Glumdalclitch</em> ride behind
            him. She carried me on her Lap in a Box tied about her Waist. The Girl had lined it on all Sides with the
            softest Cloth she could get, well quilted underneath; furnished it with her Baby&rsquo;s Bed, provided me
            with Linnen and other Necessaries; and made every thing as</p>

        <p>convenient as she could. We had no other Company but a Boy of the House, who rode after us with the Luggage.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Master&rsquo;s Design was to shew me in all the Towns by the Way, and to step out of the Road for Fifty or
            an Hundred Miles, to any Village or Person of Quality&rsquo;s House where he might expect Custom. We made
            easy Journies of not above seven or eight Score Miles a Day: For <em>Glumdalclitch</em>, on Purpose to spare
            me, complained she was tired with the trotting of the Horse. She often took me out of my Box at my own
            Desire, to give me Air and shew me the Country; but always held me fast by Leading-strings. We passed over
            five or six Rivers many Degrees broader and deeper than the <em>Nile</em> or the <em>Ganges</em>; and there
            was hardly a Rivulet so small as the <em>Thames</em> at<em> London-Bridge</em>. We were ten Weeks in our
            Journey; and I was shewn in Eighteen large Towns, besides many Villages and private Families.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the 26th Day of <em>October</em>, we arrived at the Metropolis, called in their Language
            <em>Lorbrulgrud</em>, or <em>Pride of the Universe</em>. My Master took a Lodging in the principal Street of
            the City, not far from the Royal Palace; and put out Bills in the usual Form, containing an exact
            Description of my Person and Parts. He hired a large Room between three and four Hundred Foot wide. He
            provided a Table sixty Foot in Diameter, upon which I was to act my Part; and pal-lisadoed it around three
            Foot from the Edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling over. I was shewn ten Times a Day to the Wonder
            and Satisfaction of all People. I could now speak the Language toler-ably well; and perfectly understood
            every Word that was spoken to me. Besides, I had learned their Alphabet, and could make a shift to explain a
            Sentence here and there; for <em>Glumdalclitch</em> had been my Instructer while we were at home, and at
            leisure Hours during our Journey. She carried a little Book in her Pocket, not much larger than a
            <em>Sanson</em>&rsquo;s <em>Atlas</em>;* it was a common Treatise for the use of young Girls, giving a short
            Account of their Religion; out of this she taught me my Letters, and interpreted the Words.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h e frequent Labours I underwent every Day, made in a few Weeks a very considerable Change in my Health:
            The more my Master got by me, the more unsatiable he grew. I had quite lost my Stomach,* and was almost
            reduced to a Skeleton. The Farmer observed it; and concluding I soon must die, resolved to make as good a
            Hand of * me as he could. While he was thus reasoning and resolving with himself; a <em>Slardral</em>, or
            Gentleman Usher, came from Court, commanding my Master to bring me immediately thither for the Diversion of
            the Queen and her Ladies. Some of the latter had already been to see me; and reported strange Things of my
            Beauty, Behaviour, and good Sense. Her Majesty and those who attended her, were beyond Measure delighted
            with my Demeanor. I fell on my Knees, and begged the Honour of kissing her Imperial Foot;* but this Gracious
            Princess held out her little Finger towards me (after I was set on a Table) which I embraced in both my
            Arms, and put the Tip of it with the utmost Respect, to my Lip. She made me some general Questions about my
            Country and my Travels, which I answered as distinctly and in as few Words as I could. She asked, whether I
            would be content to live at Court. I bowed down to the Board of the Table, and humbly answered, that I was
            my Master&rsquo;s Slave; but if I were at my own Disposal, I should be proud to devote my Life to her
            Majesty&rsquo;s Service. She then asked my Master whether he were will-ing to sell me at a good Price. He,
            who apprehended I could not live a Month, was ready enough to part with me; and demanded a Thousand Pieces
            of Gold; which were ordered him on the Spot, each Piece being about the Bigness of eight Hundred Moydores:*
            But, allowing for the Proportion of all Things between that Country and <em>Europe</em>, and the high Price
            of Gold among them; was hardly so great a Sum as a Thousand Guineas would be in <em>England</em>. I then
            said to the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Queen; since I was now her Majesty&rsquo;s most humble Creature and Vassal, I must beg the Favour, that
            <em>Glumdalclitch</em>, who had always tended me with so much Care and Kindness, and understood to do it so
            well, might be admitted into her Service, and continue to be my Nurse and Instructor. Her Majesty agreed to
            my Petition; and easily got the Farmer&rsquo;s Consent, who was glad enough to have his Daughter preferred
            at Court: And the poor Girl herself was not able to hide her Joy. My late Master withdrew, bidding me
            farewell, and saying he had left me in a good Service; to which I replyed not a Word, only making him a
            slight Bow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Queen observed my Coldness; and when the Farmer was gone out of the Apartment, asked me the Reason. I
            made bold to tell her Majesty, that I owed no other Obligation to my late Master, than his not dashing out
            the Brains of a poor harmless Creature found by Chance in his Field; which Obligation was amply recompensed
            by the Gain he had made in shewing me through half the Kingdom, and the Price he had now sold me for. That
            the Life I had since led, was laborious enough to kill an Animal of ten Times my Strength. That my Health
            was much impaired by the continual Drudgery of enter-taining the Rabble every Hour of the Day; and that if
            my Master had not thought my Life in Danger, her Majesty perhaps would not have got so cheap a Bargain. But
            as I was out of all fear of being ill treated under the Protection of so great and good an Empress, the
            Ornament of Nature, the Darling of the World, the Delight of her Subjects, the Phoenix of the Creation; so,
            I hoped my late Master&rsquo;s Apprehensions would appear to be groundless; for I already found my Spirits
            to revive by the Influence of her most August Presence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was the Sum of my Speech, delivered with great Impropri-eties and Hesitation; the latter Part was
            altogether framed in the Style peculiar to that People, whereof I learned some Phrases from
            <em>Glumdalclitch</em>, while she was carrying me to Court.</p>
        <p>The Queen giving great Allowance for my Defectiveness in speak-ing, was however surprised at so much Wit and
            good Sense in so diminutive an Animal. She took me in her own Hand, and carried me to the King, who was then
            retired to his Cabinet. His Majesty,* a Prince of much Gravity, and austere Countenance, not well observ-ing
            my Shape at first View, asked the Queen after a cold Manner, how long it was since she grew fond of a
            <em>Splacknuck</em>; for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay upon my Breast in her Majesty&rsquo;s</p>

        <p>right Hand. But this Princess, who hath an infinite deal of Wit and Humour, set me gently on my Feet upon the
            Scrutore;* and com-manded me to give His Majesty an Account of my self, which I did in a very few Words; and
            <em>Glumdalclitch</em>, who attended at the Cabinet Door, and could not endure I should be out of her Sight,
            being admitted; confirmed all that had passed from my Arrival at her Father&rsquo;s House.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The King, although he be as learned a Person* as any in his Dominions and had been educated in the Study of
            Philosophy, and particularly Mathematicks; yet when he observed my Shape exactly, and saw me walk erect,
            before I began to speak, conceived I might be a piece of Clock-work,* (which is in that Country arrived to a
            very great Perfection) contrived by some ingenious Artist.* But, when he heard my Voice, and found what I
            delivered to be regular and rational, he could not conceal his Astonishment. He was by no means satisfied
            with the Relation I gave him of the Manner I came into his Kingdom; but thought it a Story concerted between
            <em>Glumdalclitch</em> and her Father, who had taught me a Sett of Words to make me sell at a higher Price.
            Upon this Imagination he put several other Questions to me, and still received rational Answers, no
            otherwise defective than by a Foreign Accent, and an imperfect Knowledge in the Language; with some rustick
            Phrases which I had learned at the Farmer&rsquo;s House, and did not suit the polite Style of a Court.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His Majesty sent for three great Scholars who were then in their weekly waiting* (according to the Custom in
            that Country.) These Gentlemen, after they had a while examined my Shape with much Nicety, were of diﬀerent
            Opinions concerning me. They all agreed that I could not be produced according to the regular Laws of
            Nature;* because I was not framed with a Capacity of preserving my Life, either by Swiftness, or climbing of
            Trees, or digging Holes in the Earth. They observed by my Teeth, which they viewed with great Exactness,
            that I was a carnivorous Animal; yet most Quadrupeds being an Overmatch for me; and Field-Mice, with some
            others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I should be able to support my self, unless I fed upon Snails
            and other Insects;* which they oﬀered by many learned Arguments to evince that I could not possibly do. One
            of them seemed to think that I might be an Embrio, or abortive Birth. But this Opinion was rejected by the
            other two, who observed my Limbs to be perfect and finished; and that I had</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>lived several Years, as it was manifested from my Beard; the Stumps whereof they plainly discovered through a
            Magnifying-Glass. They would not allow me to be a Dwarf, because my Littleness was beyond all Degrees of
            Comparison; for the Queen&rsquo;s favourite Dwarf, the smallest ever known in that Kingdom, was nearly
            thirty Foot high. After much Debate, they concluded unanimously that I was only</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Relplum Scalcath</em>, which is interpreted literally <em>Lusus Natur&aelig;</em>;* a Determination
            exactly agreeable to the Modern Philosophy</p>
        <p>of <em>Europe</em>: whose Professors,* disdaining the old Evasion of <em>occult Causes</em>, whereby the
            Followers of <em>Artistotle</em> endeavour in vain to disguise their Ignorance; have invented this wonderful
            Solution of all Diﬃculties, to the unspeakable Advancement of human Knowledge.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After this decisive Conclusion, I entreated to be heard a Word or two. I applied my self to the King, and
            assured His Majesty, that I came from a Country which abounded with several Millions of both Sexes, and of
            my own Stature; where the Animals, Trees, and Houses were all in Proportion; and where by Consequence I
            might be as able to defend my self, and to find Sustenance, as any of his Majesty&rsquo;s Subjects could do
            here; which I took for a full Answer to those Gentlemens Arguments. To this they only replied with a Smile
            of Contempt,* saying, that the Farmer had instructed me very well in my Lesson. The King, who had a much
            better Understanding, dis-missing his learned Men, sent for the Farmer, who by good Fortune was not yet gone
            out of Town: Having therefore first examined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young
            Girl; his Majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be true. He desired the Queen to
            order, that a particular Care should be taken of me; and was of Opinion, that <em>Glumdalclitch</em> should
            still continue in her Oﬃce of tending me, because he observed we had a great Aﬀection for each other. A
            convenient Apartment was provided for her at Court; she had a sort of Governess appointed to take care of
            her Education, a Maid to dress her, and two other Servants for menial Oﬃces; but the Care of me was wholly
            appropriated to her self. The Queen commanded her own Cabinet-maker to contrive a Box that might serve me
            for a Bed-chamber, after the Model that <em>Glumdalclitch</em> and I should agree upon. This Man was a most
            ingeni-ous Artist; and according to my Directions, in three Weeks finished for me a wooden Chamber of
            sixteen Foot square, and twelve High;</p>

        <p>with Sash Windows, a Door, and two Closets, like a <em>London</em> Bed-chamber. The Board that made the
            Cieling was to be lifted up and down by two Hinges, to put in a Bed ready furnished by her Majesty&rsquo;s
            Upholsterer; which <em>Glumdalclitch</em> took out every Day to air, made it with her own Hands, and letting
            it down at Night, locked up the Roof over me. A Nice* Workman, who was famous for little Curiosities,
            undertook to make me two Chairs, with Backs and Frames, of a Substance not unlike Ivory; and two Tables,
            with a Cabinet to put my Things in. The Room was quilted on all Sides, as well as the Floor and the Cieling,
            to prevent any Accident from the Carelessness of those who carried me; and to break the Force of a Jolt when
            I went in a Coach. I desired a Lock for my Door to prevent Rats and Mice from coming in: The Smith after
            several Attempts made the smallest that was ever seen among them; for I have known a larger at the Gate of a
            Gentleman&rsquo;s House in <em>England</em>. I made a shift to keep the Key in a Pocket of my own, fearing
            <em>Glumdalclitch</em> might lose it. The Queen likewise ordered the thinnest Silks that could be gotten, to
            make me Cloaths, not much thicker than an <em>English</em> Blanket, very cumbersome till I was accustomed to
            them. They were after the Fashion of the Kingdom, partly resembling the <em>Persian</em>, and partly the
            <em>Chinese</em>; and are a very grave and decent Habit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Queen became so fond of my Company, that she could not dine without me. I had a Table placed upon the
            same at which her Majesty eat, just at her left Elbow; and a Chair to sit on. <em>Glumdalclitch</em> stood
            upon a Stool on the Floor, near my Table, to assist and take Care of me. I had an entire set of Silver
            Dishes and Plates, and other Necessaries, which in Proportion to those of the Queen, were not much bigger
            than what I have seen in a <em>London</em> Toy-shop, for the Furniture of a Baby-house:* These my little
            Nurse kept in her Pocket in a Silver Box, and gave me at Meals as I wanted them; always cleaning them her
            self. No Person dined with the Queen but the two Princesses Royal; the elder sixteen Years old, and the
            younger at that time thirteen and a Month. Her Majesty used to put a Bit of Meat upon one of my Dishes, out
            of which I carved for my self, and her Diversion was to see me eat in Miniature. For the Queen (who had
            indeed but a weak Stomach) took up at one Mouthful, as much as a dozen <em>English</em> Farmers could eat at
            a Meal, which to me was for some time a very nauseous Sight. She would craunch* the Wing of a Lark, Bones

        <p>as large as that of a full grown Turkey; and put a Bit of Bread in her Mouth, as big as two twelve-penny
            Loaves. She drank out of a golden Cup, above a Hogshead at a Draught. Her Knives were twice as long as a
            Scythe set straight upon the Handle. The Spoons, Forks, and other Instruments were all in the same
            Proportion. I remember when <em>Glumdalclitch</em> carried me out of Curiosity to see some of the Tables at
            Court, where ten or a dozen of these enormous Knives and Forks were lifted up together; I thought I had
            never till then beheld so terrible a Sight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is the Custom, that every <em>Wednesday</em>, (which as I have before observed, was their Sabbath) the
            King and Queen, with the Royal Issue of both Sexes, dine together in the Apartment of his Majesty; to whom I
            was now become a Favourite; and at these Times my little Chair and Table were placed at his left Hand before
            one of the Salt-sellers. This Prince took a Pleasure in conversing with me; enquiring into the Manners,
            Religion, Laws, Government, and Learning of <em>Europe</em>, wherein I gave him the best Account I was able.
            His Apprehension was so clear, and his Judgment so exact, that he made very wise Reflections and
            Observations upon all I said. But, I confess, that after I had been a little too copious in talking of my
            own beloved Country; of our Trade, and Wars by Sea and Land, of our Schisms in Religion, and Parties in the
            State; the Prejudices of his Education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear taking me up in his right
            Hand, and stroaking me gently with the other; after an hearty Fit of laughing, asked me whether I were a
            <em>Whig</em> or a <em>Tory</em>.* Then turning to his first Minister, who waited behind him with a white
            Staﬀ, near as tall as the Main-mast of the Royal <em>Sovereign</em>;* he observed, how contemptible a Thing
            was human Grandeur, which could be mimicked by such diminutive Insects as I; And yet, said he, I dare
            engage, these Creatures have their Titles and Distinctions of Honour; they contrive little Nests and
            Burrows, that they call Houses and Cities;* they make a Figure in Dress and Equipage; they love, they fight,
            they dispute, they cheat, they betray. And thus he continued on, while my Colour came and went several
            Times, with Indignation to hear our noble Country, the Mistress of Arts and Arms, the Scourge of
            <em>France</em>, the Arbitress of <em>Europe</em>, the Seat of Virtue, Piety, Honour and Truth, the Pride
            and Envy of the World, contemptuously treated.</p>

        <p>Thoughts, I began to doubt whether I were injured or no. For, after having been accustomed several Months to
            the Sight and Converse of this People, and observed every Object upon which I cast my Eyes, to be of
            proportionable Magnitude; the Horror I had first conceived from their Bulk and Aspect was so far worn oﬀ,
            that if I had then beheld a Company of <em>English</em> Lords and Ladies in their Finery and Birth-day
            Cloaths,* acting their several Parts in the most courtly Manner of Strutting, and Bowing and Prating; to say
            the Truth, I should have been strongly tempted to laugh as much at them as the King and his Grandees did at
            me. Neither indeed could I forbear smiling at my self, when the Queen used to place me upon her Hand towards
            a Looking-Glass, by which both our Persons appeared before me in full View together; and there could nothing
            be more ridiculous than the Comparison: So that I really began to imagine my self dwindled many Degrees
            below my usual Size.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nothing angered and mortified me so much as the Queen&rsquo;s Dwarf,* who being of the lowest Stature that
            was ever in that Country, (for I verily think he was not full Thirty Foot high) became insolent at seeing a
            Creature so much beneath him, that he would always aﬀect to swagger and look big as he passed by me in the
            Queen&rsquo;s Antichamber, while I was standing on some Table talking with the Lords or Ladies of the Court;
            and he seldom failed of a smart Word or two upon my Littleness; against which I could only revenge my self
            by calling him <em>Brother</em>, challenging him to wrestle; and such Repartees as are usual in the Mouths
            of <em>Court Pages</em>. One Day at Dinner, this malicious little Cubb was so nettled with something I had
            said to him, that raising himself upon the Frame of her Majesty&rsquo;s Chair, he took me up by the Middle,
            as I was sitting down, not think-ing any Harm, and let me drop into a large Silver Bowl of Cream;* and then
            ran away as fast as he could. I fell over Head and Ears, and if I had not been a good Swimmer, it might have
            gone very hard with me; for <em>Glumdalclitch</em> in that Instant happened to be at the other End of the
            Room; and the Queen was in such a Fright, that she wanted Presence of Mind to assist me. But my little Nurse
            ran to my Relief; and took me out, after I had swallowed above a Quart of Cream. I was put to Bed; however I
            received no other Damage than the loss of a Suit of Cloaths, which was utterly spoiled. The Dwarf was
            soundly whipped, and as a further Punishment, forced to drink up the Bowl of Cream, into which he had thrown
            me; neither was he ever</p>

        <p>restored to Favour: For, soon after the Queen bestowed him to a Lady of high Quality; so that I saw him no
            more, to my very great Satisfaction; for I could not tell to what Extremity such a malicious Urchin might
            have carried his Resentment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had before served me a scurvy Trick, which set the Queen a laughing, although at the same time she was
            heartily vexed, and would have immediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to intercede. Her
            Majesty had taken a Marrow-bone upon her Plate; and after knocking out the Marrow, placed the Bone again in
            the Dish erect as it stood before; the Dwarf watching his Opportun-ity, while <em>Glumdalclitch</em> was
            gone to the Sideboard, mounted the Stool she stood on to take care of me at Meals; took me up in both Hands,
            and squeezing my Legs together, wedged them into the Marrow-bone above my Waist; where I stuck for some
            time, and made a very ridiculous Figure. I believe it was near a Minute before any one knew what was become
            of me; for I thought it below me to cry out. But, as Princes seldom get their Meat hot, my Legs were not
            scalded, only my Stockings and Breeches in a sad Condition. The Dwarf at my Entreaty had no other Punishment
            than a sound whipping.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was frequently raillied by the Queen upon Account of my Fearfulness; and she used to ask me whether the
            People of my Coun-try were as great Cowards as my self. The Occasion was this. The Kingdom is much pestered
            with Flies in Summer; and these odious Insects, each of them as big as a <em>Dunstable</em> Lark,* hardly
            gave me any Rest while I sat at Dinner, with their continual Humming and Buzzing about mine Ears. They would
            sometimes alight upon my Victuals, and leave their Loathsome Excrement or Spawn behind, which to me was very
            visible, although not to the Natives of that Country, whose large Opticks were not so acute as mine in
            viewing smaller Objects. Sometimes they would fix upon my Nose or Fore-head, where they stung me to the
            Quick, smelling very oﬀensively; and I could easily trace that viscous Matter, which our Naturalists tell us
            enables those Creatures to walk with their Feet upwards upon a Ceiling. I had much ado to defend my self
            against these detestable Animals, and could not forbear starting when they came on my Face. It was the
            common Practice of the Dwarf to catch a Number of these Insects in his Hand, as School-boys do among us, and
            let them out suddenly under my Nose, on Purpose to frighten me, and divert the</p>

        <p>Queen. My Remedy was to cut them in Pieces with my Knife as they flew in the Air; wherein my Dexterity was
            much admired.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I remember one Morning when <em>Glumdalclitch</em> had set me in my Box upon a Window, as she usually did in
            fair Days to give me Air, (for I durst not venture to let the Box be hung on a Nail out of the Window, as we
            do with Cages in <em>England</em>) after I had lifted up one of my Sashes, and sat down at my Table to eat a
            Piece of Sweet-Cake for my Breakfast; above twenty Wasps, allured by the Smell, came flying into the Room,
            humming louder than the Drones of as many Bagpipes. Some of them seized my Cake, and carried it piecemeal
            away; others flew about my Head and Face, confounding me with the Noise, and putting me in the utmost Terror
            of their Stings. However I had the Courage to rise and draw my Hanger, and attack them in the Air. I
            dispatched four of them, but the rest got away, and I presently shut my Window. These Insects were as large
            as Partridges; I took out their Stings, found them an Inch and a half long, and as sharp as Needles. I
            carefully preserved them all, and having since shewn them with some other Curiosities in several Parts of
            <em>Europe</em>, upon my Return to <em>England</em> I gave three of them to <em>Gresham College</em>,* and
            kept the fourth for my self.</p>

                of the Metropolis. The Author&rsquo;s Way of travelling. The chief Temple described.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I n ow intend to give the Reader a short Description of this Country, as far as I travelled in it, which was
            not above two thousand Miles round <em>Lorbrulgrud</em> the Metropolis. For, the Queen, whom I always
            attended, never went further when she accompanied the King in his Progresses; and there staid till his
            Majesty returned from viewing his Frontiers. The whole Extent of this Prince&rsquo;s Dominions reacheth
            about six thousand Miles in Length, and from three to five in Breadth. From whence I cannot but conclude,
            that our Geographers of <em>Europe</em> are in a great Error, by supposing nothing but Sea between
            <em>Japan</em> and <em>California</em>: For it was ever my Opinion, that there must be a Balance of Earth to
            counterpoise the great Continent of <em>Tartary</em>; and therefore they ought to correct their Maps and
            Charts, by join-ing this vast Tract of Land to the North-west Parts of <em>America</em>; wherein I shall be
            ready to lend them my Assistance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Kingdom is a Peninsula,* terminated to the North-east by a Ridge of Mountains thirty Miles high which are
            altogether impass-able by Reason of the Volcanoes upon the Tops. Neither do the most Learned know what sort
            of Mortals inhabit beyond those Mountains, or whether they be inhabited at all. On the three other Sides it
            is bounded by the Ocean. There is not one Sea-port in the whole Kingdom; and those Parts of the Coasts into
            which the Rivers issue, are so full of pointed Rocks, and the Sea generally so rough, that there is no
            venturing with the smallest of their Boats; so that these People are wholly excluded from any Commerce with
            the rest of the World.* But the large Rivers are full of Vessels, and abound with excellent Fish; for they
            seldom get any from the Sea, because the Sea-fish are of the same Size with those in <em>Europe</em>, and
            consequently not worth catching; whereby it is manifest, that Nature, in the Production of Plants and
            Animals of so extraordinary a Bulk, is wholly confined to this Continent; of which I leave the Reasons to be
            determined by Philosophers. However, now and then they take a</p>

        <p>Whale that happens to be dashed against the Rocks, which the common People feed on heartily. These Whales I
            have known so large that a Man could hardly carry one upon his Shoulders; and sometimes for Curiosity they
            are brought in Hampers to <em>Lorbrulgrud</em>: I saw one of them in a Dish at the King&rsquo;s Table, which
            passed for a Rarity; but I did not observe he was fond of it; for I think indeed the Bigness disgusted him,
            although I have seen one somewhat larger in <em>Greenland</em>.</p>
        <p>The Country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one Cities,* near an hundred walled Towns, and a great
            Number of Villages. To satisfy my curious Reader, it may be suﬃcient to describe <em>Lorbrulgrud</em>.* This
            City stands upon almost two equal Parts on each Side the River that passes through. It contains above eighty
            thousand Houses. It is in Length three <em>Glonglungs</em>* (which make about fifty four English Miles) and
            two and a half in Breadth, as I measured it myself in the Royal Map made by the King&rsquo;s Order, which
            was laid on the Ground on purpose for me, and extended an hundred Feet; I paced the Diameter and
            Circumference several times Bare-foot, and computing by the Scale, measured it pretty exactly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The King&rsquo;s Palace is no regular Edifice, but an Heap of Buildings about seven Miles round: The chief
            Rooms are generally two hun-dred and forty Foot high, and broad and long in Proportion. A Coach was allowed
            to <em>Glumdalclitch</em> and me, wherein her Governess frequently took her out to see the Town, or go among
            the Shops; and I was always of the Party, carried in my Box; although the Girl at my own Desire would often
            take me out, and hold me in her Hand, that I might more conveniently view the Houses and the People as we
            passed along the Streets. I reckoned our Coach to be about a Square of <em>Westminster-Hall</em>, but not
            altogether so High; however, I cannot be very exact. One Day the Governess ordered our Coachman to stop at
            several Shops; where the Beggars watching their Opportunity, crouded to the Sides of the Coach, and gave me
            the most horrible Spectacles that ever an <em>European</em> Eye beheld. There was a Woman with a Cancer in
            her Breast, swelled to a monstrous Size, full of Holes, in two or three of which I could have easily crept,
            and covered my whole Body. There was a Fellow with a Wen in his Neck, larger than five Woolpacks; and
            another with a couple of wooden Legs, each about twenty Foot high. But, the most hateful Sight of all was
            the Lice crawling on their Cloathes: I could see distinctly the Limbs</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>of these Vermin with my naked Eye, much better than those of an <em>European</em> Louse through a Microscope;
            and their Snouts with which they rooted like Swine. They were the first I had ever beheld; and I should have
            been curious enough to dissect one of them, if I had proper Instruments (which I unluckily left behind me in
            the Ship) although indeed the Sight was so nauseous, that it perfectly turned my Stomach.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beside the large Box in which I was usually carried, the Queen ordered a smaller one to be made for me, of
            about twelve Foot Square, and ten high, for the Convenience of Travelling; because the other was somewhat
            too large for <em>Glumdalclitch</em>&rsquo;s Lap, and cumber-som in the Coach; it was made by the same
            Artist, whom I directed in the whole Contrivance. This travelling Closet was an exact Square with a Window
            in the Middle of three of the Squares, and each Window was latticed with Iron Wire on the outside, to
            prevent Accidents in long Journeys. On the fourth Side, which had no Window, two strong Staples were fixed,
            through which the Person that carried me, when I had a Mind to be on Horseback, put in a Leathern Belt, and
            buckled it about his Waist. This was always the Oﬃce of some grave trusty Servant in whom I could confide,
            whether I attended the King and Queen in their Progresses, or were disposed to see the Gardens, or pay a
            Visit to some great Lady or Minister of State in the Court, when <em>Glumdalclitch</em> happened to be out
            of Order: For I soon began to be known and esteemed among the greatest Oﬃcers, I suppose more upon Account
            of their Majesty&rsquo;s Favour, than any Merit of my own. In Journeys, when I was weary of the Coach, a
            Servant on Horseback would buckle my Box, and place it on a Cushion before him; and there I had a full
            Prospect of the Country on three Sides from my three Windows. I had in this Closet a Field-Bed and a Hammock
            hung from the Ceiling, two Chairs and a Table, neatly screwed to the Floor, to prevent being tossed about by
            the Agitation of the Horse or the Coach. And having been long used to Sea-Voyages, those Motions, although
            sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whenever I had a Mind to see the Town, it was always in my Travelling-Closet; which <em>Glumdalclitch</em>
            held in her Lap in a kind of open Sedan, after the Fashion of the Country, born by four Men, and attended by
            two others in the Queen&rsquo;s Livery. The People who had often heard of me, were very curious to croud
            about the Sedan;</p>

        <p>and the Girl was complaisant enough to make the Bearers stop, and to take me in her Hand that I might be more
            conveniently seen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was very desirous to see the chief Temple, and particularly the Tower belonging to it, which is reckoned
            the highest in the Kingdom. Accordingly one Day my Nurse carried me thither, but I may truly say I came back
            disappointed; for, the Height is not above three thousand Foot, reckoning from the Ground to the highest
            Pinnacle top; which allowing for the Diﬀerence between the Size of those People, and us in <em>Europe</em>,
            is no great matter for Admiration, nor at all equal in Proportion (if I rightly remember) to
            <em>Salisbury</em> Steeple.* But, not to detract from a Nation to which during my Life I shall acknowledge
            myself extremely obliged; it must be allowed, that whatever this famous Tower wants in Height, is amply made
            up in Beauty and Strength. For the Walls are near an hundred Foot thick, built of hewn Stone, whereof each
            is about forty Foot square, and adorned on all Sides with Statues of Gods and Emperors cut in Marble larger
            than the Life, placed in their several Niches. I meas-ured a little Finger which had fallen down from one of
            these Statues, and lay unperceived among some Rubbish; and found it exactly four Foot and an Inch in Length.
            <em>Glumdalclitch</em> wrapped it up in a Hand-kerchief, and carried it home in her Pocket to keep among
            other Trinkets, of which the Girl was very fond, as Children at her Age usually are.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The King&rsquo;s Kitchen is indeed a noble Building, vaulted at Top, and about six hundred Foot high. The
            great Oven is not so wide by ten Paces as the Cupola at St <em>Paul</em> &rsquo;s:* For I measured the
            latter on purpose after my Return. But if I should describe the Kitchen-grate, the prodigious Pots and
            Kettles, the Joints of Meat turning on the Spits, with many other Particulars; perhaps I should be hardly
            believed;* at least a severe Critick would be apt to think I enlarged a little, as Travellers are often
            suspected to do. To avoid which Censure, I fear I have run too much into the other Extream; and that if this
            Treatise should happen to be translated into the Language of <em>Brobdingnag</em>, (which is the general
            Name of that Kingdom) and transmitted thither; the King and his People would have Reason to complain; that I
            had done them an Injury by a false and diminutive Representation.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>s h o u l d have lived happy enough in that Country, if my Littleness had not exposed me to several
                ridiculous and troublesome Accidents; some of which I shall venture to relate. <em>Glumdalclitch</em>
                often carried me into the Gardens of the Court in my smaller Box, and would sometimes take me out of it
                and hold me in her Hand, or set me down to walk. I remember, before the Dwarf left the Queen, he
                followed us one Day into those Gardens; and my Nurse having set me down, he and I being close together,
                near some Dwarf Apple-trees,</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>must need shew my Wit by a silly Allusion between him and the Trees, which happens to hold in their
                Language as it doth in ours. Whereupon, the malicious Rogue watching his Opportunity, when I was walking
                under one of them, shook it directly over my Head, by which a dozen Apples, each of them near as large
                as a <em>Bristol</em> Barrel, came tumbling about my Ears; one of them hit me on the Back as I chanced
                to stoop, and knocked me down flat on my Face, but I received no other Hurt; and the Dwarf was pardoned
                at my Desire, because I had given the Provocation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another Day, <em>Glumdalclitch</em> left me on a smooth Grass-plot to divert my self while she walked at some
            Distance with her Governess. In the mean time there suddenly fell such a violent Shower of Hail, that I was
            immediately by the Force of it struck to the Ground: And when I was down, the Hail-stones gave me such cruel
            Bangs all over the Body, as if I had been pelted with Tennis-Balls; however I made a Shift to creep on all
            four, and shelter my self by lying flat on my Face on the Lee-side of a Border of Lemmon Thyme; but so
            bruised from Head to Foot, that I could not go abroad in ten Days. Neither is this at all to be wondered at;
            because Nature in that Country observing the same Proportion through all her Operations, a Hail-stone is
            near Eighteen Hundred Times as large as one in <em>Europe</em>; which I can assert upon Experience, having
            been so curious to weigh and measure them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, a more dangerous Accident happened to me in the same</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>106&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>Garden, when my little Nurse, believing she had put me in a secure Place, which I often entreated her to do,
            that I might enjoy my own Thoughts; and having left my Box at home to avoid the Trouble of carrying it, went
            to another Part of the Garden with her Governess and some Ladies of her Acquaintance. While she was absent
            and out of hearing, a small white Spaniel belonging to one of the chief Gardiners, having got by Accident
            into the Garden, happened to range near the Place where I lay. The Dog following the Scent, came directly
            up, and taking me in his Mouth, ran strait to his Master, wagging his Tail, and set me gently on the Ground.
            By good Fortune he had been so well taught, that I was carried between his Teeth without the least Hurt, or
            even tearing my Cloaths. But, the poor Gardiner, who knew me well, and had a great Kindness for me, was in a
            terrible Fright. He gently took me up in both his Hands, and asked me how I did; but I was so amazed* and
            out of Breath, that I could not speak a Word. In a few Minutes I came to my self, and he carried me safe to
            my little Nurse, who by this time had returned to the Place where she left me, and was in cruel Agonies when
            I did not appear, nor answer when she called; she severely reprimanded the Gardiner on Account of his Dog.
            But, the Thing was hushed up, and never known at Court; for the Girl was afraid of the Queen&rsquo;s Anger;
            and truly as to my self, I thought it would not be for my Reputation that such a Story should go about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Accident absolutely determined <em>Glumdalclitch</em> never to trust me abroad for the future out of her
            Sight. I had been long afraid of this Resolution; and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky
            Adventures that happened in those Times when I was left by my self. Once a Kite hovering over the Garden,
            made a Stoop at me, and if I had not resolutely drawn my Hanger, and run under a thick Espalier, he would
            have certainly carried me away in his Talons. Another time, walking to the Top of a fresh Mole-hill, I fell
            to my Neck in the Hole through which that Animal had cast up the Earth; and coined some Lye not worth
            remembering, to excuse my self for spoiling my cloaths. I likewise broke my right Shin against the Shell of
            a Snail, which I happened to stumble over, as I was walking alone, and thinking on poor <em>England</em>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified, to observe in those solitary Walks, that the smaller
            Birds did not appear to be at</p>

        <p>all afraid of me; but would hop about within a Yard Distance, looking for Worms, and other Food, with as much
            Indiﬀerence and Security as if no Creature at all were near them. I remember, a Thrush had the Confidence to
            snatch out of my Hand with his Bill, a Piece of Cake that <em>Glumdalclitch</em> had just given me for my
            Breakfast. When I attempted to catch any of these Birds, they would boldly turn against me, endeavouring to
            pick my Fingers, which I durst not venture within their Reach; and then they would hop back unconcerned to
            hunt for Worms or Snails, as they did before. But, one Day I took a thick Cudgel, and threw it with all my
            Strength so luckily at a Linnet, that I knocked him down, and seizing him by the Neck with both my Hands,
            ran with him in Triumph to my Nurse. However, the Bird who had only been stunned, recovering himself, gave
            me so many Boxes with his Wings on both Sides of my Head and Body, although I held him at Arms Length, and
            was out of the Reach of his Claws, that I was twenty Times thinking to let him go. But I was soon relieved
            by one of our Servants, who wrung oﬀ the Bird&rsquo;s Neck; and I had him next Day for Dinner by the
            Queen&rsquo;s Command. This Linnet, as near as I can remember, seemed to be somewhat larger than an
            <em>English</em> Swan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Maids of Honour* often invited <em>Glumdalclitch</em> to their Apartments, and desired she would bring me
            along with her, on Purpose to have the Pleasure of seeing and touching me. They would often strip me naked
            from Top to Toe, and lay me at full Length in their Bosoms; wherewith I was much disgusted; because, to say
            the Truth, a very oﬀensive Smell came from their Skins; which I do not mention or intend to the Disadvantage
            of those excellent Ladies, for whom I have all Manner of Respect: But, I conceive, that my Sense was more
            acute in Proportion to my Littleness; and that those illus-trious Persons were no more disagreeable to their
            Lovers, or to each other, than People of the same Quality are with us in <em>England</em>. And, after all, I
            found their natural Smell was much more supportable than when they used Perfumes, under which I immediately
            swooned away. I cannot forget, that an intimate Friend of mine in <em>Lilliput</em> took the Freedom in a
            warm Day, when I had used a good deal of Exercise, to complain of a strong Smell about me; although I am as
            little faulty that way as most of my Sex: But I suppose, his Faculty of Smelling was as nice with regard to
            me, as mine was to that of this People. Upon this Point, I cannot forbear doing Justice to the Queen</p>

        <p>my Mistress, and <em>Glumdalclitch</em> my Nurse; whose Persons were as sweet as those of any Lady in
            <em>England</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That which gave me most Uneasiness among these Maids of Honour, when my Nurse carried me to visit them, was
            to see them use me without any Manner of Ceremony, like a Creature who had no Sort of Consequence. For, they
            would strip themselves to the Skin, and put on their Smocks in my Presence, while I was placed on their
            Toylet* directly before their naked Bodies; which, I am sure, to me was very far from being a tempting
            Sight, or from giving me any other Motions* than those of Horror and Disgust. Their Skins appeared so coarse
            and uneven, so variously coloured when I saw them near, with a Mole here and there as broad as a Trencher,
            and Hairs hanging from it thicker than Pack-threads; to say nothing further concerning the rest of their
            Persons. Neither did they at all scruple while I was by, to discharge what they had drunk, to the Quantity
            of at least two Hogsheads, in a Vessel that held above three Tuns.* The handsomest among these Maids of
            Honour, a pleasant* frolicsome Girl of sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her Nipples; with
            many other Tricks, wherein the Reader will excuse me for not being over particular. But, I was so much
            dis-pleased, that I entreated <em>Glumdalclitch</em> to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young Lady
            any more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One Day, a young Gentleman who was a Nephew to my Nurse&rsquo;s Governess, came and pressed them both to see
            an Execution. It was of a Man who had murdered one of that Gentleman&rsquo;s intimate Acquaintance.
            <em>Glumdalclitch</em> was prevailed on to be of the Company, very much against her Inclination, for she was
            naturally tender hearted: And, as for my self, although I abhorred such Kind of Spectacles; yet my Curiosity
            tempted me to see something that I thought must be extraordinary. The Malefactor was fixed in a Chair upon a
            Scaﬀold erected for the Purpose; and his Head cut oﬀ at one Blow with a Sword of about forty Foot long. The
            Veins and Arteries spouted up such a prodigious Quantity of Blood, and so high in the Air, that the great
            <em>Jet d&rsquo;Eau</em> at <em>Versailles</em>* was not equal for the Time it lasted; and the Head when it
            fell on the Scaﬀold Floor, gave such a Bounce, as made me start, although I were at least an
            <em>English</em> Mile distant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Queen, who often used to hear me talk of my Sea-Voyages, and took all Occasions to divert me when I was
            melancholy, asked me</p>

        <p>whether I understood how to handle a Sail or an Oar; and whether a little Exercise of Rowing might not be
            convenient for my Health. I answered, that I understood both very well. For although my proper Employment
            had been to be Surgeon or Doctor to the Ship; yet often upon a Pinch, I was forced to work like a common
            Mariner. But I could not see how this could be done in their Country, where the smallest Wherry was equal to
            a first Rate Man of War among us; and such a Boat as I could manage, would never live in any of their
            Rivers: Her Majesty said, if I would contrive a Boat, her own Joyner should make it, and she would provide a
            Place for me to sail in. The Fellow was an ingenious Workman, and by my Instructions in ten Days finished a
            Pleasure-Boat with all its Tackling, able conveniently to hold eight <em>Europeans</em>. When it was
            finished, the Queen was so delighted, that she ran with it in her Lap to the King, who ordered it to be put
            in a Cistern full of Water, with me in it, by way of Tryal; where I could not manage my two Sculls or little
            Oars for want of Room. But, the Queen had before contrived another Project. She ordered the Joyner to make a
            wooden Trough of three Hundred Foot long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which being well pitched to prevent
            leaking, was placed on the Floor along the Wall, in an outer Room of the Palace. It had a Cock near the
            Bottom, to let out the Water when it began to grow stale; and two Servants could easily fill it in half an
            Hour. Here I often used to row for my own Diversion, as well as that of the Queen and her Ladies, who
            thought themselves agreeably entertained with my Skill and Agility. Sometimes I would put up my Sail, and
            then my Business was only to steer, while the Ladies gave me a Gale with their Fans; and when they were
            weary, some of the Pages would blow my Sail forward with their Breath, while I shewed my Art steering
            Starboard or Larboard as I pleased. When I had done, <em>Glumdalclitch</em> always carried my Boat into her
            Closet, and hung it on a Nail to dry.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In this Exercise I once met an Accident which had like to have cost me my Life. For, one of the Pages having
            put my Boat into the Trough; the Governess who attended <em>Glumdalclitch</em>, very oﬃciously lifted me up
            to place me in the Boat; but I happened to slip through her Fingers, and should have infallibly fallen down
            forty Foot upon the Floor, if by the luckiest Chance in the World, I had not been stop&rsquo;d by a
            Corking-pin that stuck in the good Gentlewoman&rsquo;s Stomacher;* the Head of the Pin passed between my
            Shirt and the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Waistband of my Breeches; and thus I was held by the Middle in the Air, till <em>Glumdalclitch</em> ran to my
            Relief.</p>
        <p>Another time, one of the Servants, whose Oﬃce it was to fill my Trough every third Day with fresh Water; was
            so careless to let a huge Frog (not perceiving it) slip out of his Pail. The Frog lay concealed till I was
            put into my Boat, but then seeking a resting Place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one Side, that I
            was forced to balance it with all my Weight on the other, to prevent overturning. When the Frog got in, it
            hopped at once half the Length of the Boat, and then over my Head, backwards and for-wards, daubing my Face
            and Cloaths with its odious Slime. The Largeness of its Features made it appear the most deformed Animal
            that can be conceived. However, I desired <em>Glumdalclitch</em> to let me deal with it alone. I banged it a
            good while with one of my Sculls, and at last forced it to leap out of the Boat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, the greatest Danger I ever underwent in that Kingdom, was from a Monkey, who belonged to one of the
            Clerks of the Kitchen. <em>Glumdalclitch</em> had locked me up in her Closet, while she went some-where upon
            Business, or a Visit. The Weather being very warm, the Closet Window was left open, as well as the Windows
            and the Door of my bigger Box, in which I usually lived, because of its Largeness and Conveniency. As I sat
            quietly meditating at my Table, I heard something bounce in at the Closet Window, and skip about from one
            Side to the other; whereat, although I were much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not stirring from
            my Seat; and then I saw this frolicksome Animal, frisking and leaping up and down, till at last he came to
            my Box, which he seemed to view with great Pleasure and Curiosity, peeping in at the Door and every Window.
            I retreated to the farther Corner of my Room, or Box; but the Monkey looking in at every Side, put me into
            such a Fright, that I wanted Presence of Mind to conceal myself under the Bed, as I might easily have done.
            After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last espyed me; and reaching one of his
            Paws in at the Door, as a Cat does when she plays with a Mouse, although I often shifted Place to avoid him;
            he at length seized the Lappet of my Coat (which being made of that Country Silk, was very thick and strong)
            and dragged me out. He took me up in his right Fore-foot, and held me as a Nurse doth a Child she is going
            to suckle; just as I have seen the same Sort of Creature do with a Kitten in <em>Europe</em>: and when I
            oﬀered to struggle,</p>

        <p>he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more prudent to submit. I have good Reason to believe that he took
            me for a young one of his own Species, by his often stroaking my Face very gently with his other Paw. In
            these Diversions he was interrupted by a Noise at the Closet Door, as if some Body were opening it;
            whereupon he sud-denly leaped up to the Window at which he had come in, and thence upon the Leads and
            Gutters, walking upon three Legs, and holding me in the fourth, till he clambered up to a Roof * that was
            next to ours. I heard <em>Glumdalclitch</em> give a Shriek at the Moment he was carrying me out. The poor
            Girl was almost distracted: That Quarter of the Palace was all in an Uproar; the Servants ran for Ladders;
            the Monkey was seen by Hundreds in the Court, sitting upon the Ridge of a Building, holding me like a Baby
            in one of his Fore-Paws, and feeding me with the other, by cramming into my Mouth some Victuals he had
            squeezed out of the Bag on one side of his Chaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat many of the
            Rabble below could not forbear laughing; neither do I think they justly ought to be blamed; for without
            Question, the Sight was ridiculous enough to every Body but my self. Some of the People threw up Stones,
            hoping to drive the Monkey down; but this was strictly forbidden, or else very probably my Brains had been
            dashed out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Ladders were now applied, and mounted by several Men; which the Monkey observing, and finding himself
            almost encompassed; not being able to make Speed enough with his three Legs, let me drop on a Ridge-Tyle,
            and made his Escape. Here I sat for some time five Hundred Yards from the Ground, expecting every Moment to
            be blown down by the Wind, or to fall by my own Giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from the Ridge to
            the Eves. But an honest Lad, one of my Nurse&rsquo;s Footmen, climbed up, and putting me into his Breeches
            Pocket, brought me down safe.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was almost choaked with the filthy Stuﬀ the Monkey had crammed down my Throat; but, my dear little Nurse
            picked it out of my Mouth with a small Needle; and then I fell to vomiting, which gave me great Relief. Yet
            I was so weak and bruised in the Sides with the Squeezes given me by this odious Animal, that I was forced
            to keep my Bed a Fortnight. The King, Queen, and all the Court, sent every Day to enquire after my Health;
            and her Majesty made me several Visits during my Sickness. The Monkey was killed, and an Order made that no
            such Animal should be kept about the Palace.</p>

        <p>When I attended the King after my Recovery, to return him Thanks for his Favours, he was pleased to railly me
            a good deal upon this Adventure. He asked me what my Thoughts and Speculations were while I lay in the
            Monkey&rsquo;s Paw; how I liked the Victuals he gave me, his Manner of Feeding; and whether the fresh Air on
            the Roof had sharpened my Stomach. He desired to know what I would have done upon such an Occasion in my own
            Country. I told his Majesty, that in <em>Europe</em> we had no Monkies, except such as were brought for
            Curiosities from other Places, and so small, that I could deal with a Dozen of them together, if they
            presumed to attack me. And as for that monstrous Animal with whom I was so lately engaged, (it was indeed as
            large as an Elephant) if my Fears had suﬀered me to think so far as to make Use of my Hanger (looking
            fiercely, and clapping my Hand upon the Hilt as I spoke) when he poked his Paw into my Chamber, perhaps I
            should have given him such a Wound, as would have made him glad to withdraw it with more Haste than he put
            it in. This I delivered in a firm Tone, like a Person who was jealous lest his Courage should be called in
            Question. However, my Speech produced nothing else besides a loud Laughter; which all the Respect due to his
            Majesty from those about him, could not make them contain. This made me reflect, how vain an Attempt it is
            for a Man to endeavour doing himself Honour among those who are out of all Degree of Equality or Comparison
            with him. And yet I have seen the Moral of my own Behaviour very frequent in <em>England</em> since my
            Return; where a little contemptible Varlet, without the least Title to Birth, Person, Wit, or common Sense,
            shall presume to look with Importance, and put himself upon a Foot with the greatest Persons of the Kingdom.

        <p>I was every Day furnishing the Court with some ridiculous Story; and <em>Glumdalclitch</em>, although she
            loved me to Excess, yet was arch enough to inform the Queen, whenever I committed any Folly that she thought
            would be diverting to her Majesty. The Girl who had been out of Order, was carried by her Governess to take
            the Air about an Hour&rsquo;s Distance, or thirty Miles from Town. They alighted out of the Coach near a
            small Footpath in a Field; and <em>Glumdalclitch</em> setting down my travelling Box, I went out of it to
            walk. There was a Cow-dung* in the Path, and I must needs try my Activity by attempt-ing to leap over it. I
            took a Run, but unfortunately jumped short, and found myself just in the Middle up to my Knees. I waded
            through</p>

        <p>with some Diﬃculty, and one of the Footmen wiped me as clean as he could with his Handkerchief; for I was
            filthily bemired, and my Nurse confined me to my Box until we returned home; where the Queen was soon
            informed of what had passed, and the Footmen spread it about the Court; so that all the Mirth, for some
            Days, was at my Expence.</p>

        <p>CHAPTER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIX</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Several Contrivances of the Author to please the King and Queen. He shews his Skill in Musick. The King
                enquires into the State of</em> Europe<em>, which the Author relates to him. The King&rsquo;s
                Observations thereon.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I u s e d to attend the King&rsquo;s Levee* once or twice a Week, and had often seen him under the
            Barber&rsquo;s Hand, which indeed was at first very terrible to behold. For, the Razor was almost twice as
            long as an ordinary Scythe. His Majesty, according to the Custom of the Country, was only shaved twice a
            Week. I once prevailed on the Barber to give me some of the Suds or Lather, out of which I picked Forty or
            Fifty of the strongest Stumps of Hair. I then took a Piece of fine Wood, and cut it like the Back of a Comb,
            making several Holes in it at equal Distance with as small a Needle as I could get from
            <em>Glumdalclitch</em>. I fixed in the Stumps so artificially,* scraping and sloping them with my Knife
            toward the Points, that I made a very tolerable Comb; which was a seasonable Supply,* my own being so much
            broken in the Teeth, that it was almost useless; Neither did I know any Artist in that Country so nice and
            exact, as would undertake to make me another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And this puts me in mind of an Amusement wherein I spent many of my leisure Hours. I desired the
            Queen&rsquo;s Woman to save for me the Combings of her Majesty&rsquo;s Hair, whereof in time I got a good
            Quantity; and consulting with my Friend the Cabinet-maker, who had received general Orders to do little
            Jobbs for me; I directed him to make two Chair-frames, no larger than those I had in my Box, and then to
            bore little Holes with a fine Awl round those Parts where I designed the Backs and Seats; through these
            Holes I wove the strongest Hairs I could pick out, just after the Manner of Cane-chairs in <em>England</em>.
            When they were finished, I made a Present of them to her Majesty, who kept them in her Cabinet, and used to
            shew them for Curiosities; as indeed they were the Wonder of every one who beheld them. The Queen would have
            had me sit upon one of these Chairs, but I absolutely refused to obey her; protesting I would rather die a
            Thousand Deaths than place a dishonourable Part of my Body on those precious Hairs that once adorned her
            Majesty&rsquo;s Head.*</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of these Hairs (as I had always a Mechanical Genius*) I likewise made a neat little Purse about five Foot
            long, with her Majesty&rsquo;s Name decyphered* in Gold Letters; which I gave to <em>Glumdalclitch</em>, by
            the Queen&rsquo;s Consent. To say the Truth, it was more for Shew than Use, being not of Strength to bear
            the Weight of the larger Coins; and therefore she kept nothing in it, but some little Toys that Girls are
            fond of.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The King, who delighted in Musick, had frequent Consorts* at Court, to which I was sometimes carried, and set
            in my Box on a Table to hear them: But, the Noise was so great, that I could hardly distinguish the Tunes. I
            am confident, that all the Drums and Trumpets of a Royal Army, beating and sounding together just at your
            Ears, could not equal it. My Practice was to have my Box removed from the Places where the Performers sat,
            as far as I could; then to shut the Doors and Windows of it, and draw the Window-Curtains; after which I
            found their Musick not disagreeable.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had learned in my Youth to play a little upon the Spinet; <em>Glumdalclitch</em> kept one in her Chamber,
            and a Master attended twice a Week to teach her: I call it a Spinet, because it somewhat resembled that
            Instrument, and was play&rsquo;d upon in the same Manner. A Fancy came into my Head, that I would entertain
            the King and Queen with an <em>English</em> Tune upon this Instrument. But this appeared extremely diﬃcult:
            For, the Spinet was near sixty Feet long, each Key being almost a Foot wide; so that, with my Arms extended,
            I could not reach to above five Keys; and to press them down required a good smart stroak with my Fist,
            which would be too great a Labour, and to no purpose. The Method I contrived was this. I prepared two round
            Sticks about the Bigness of common Cudgels; they were thicker at one End than the other; and I covered the
            thicker Ends with a Piece of a Mouse&rsquo;s Skin, that by rapping on them, I might neither Damage the Tops
            of the Keys, nor interrupt the Sound. Before the Spinet, a Bench was placed, about four Foot below the Keys,
            and I was put upon the Bench. I ran sideling upon it that way and this, as fast as I could, banging the
            proper Keys with my two Sticks; and made a shift to play a Jigg to the great Satisfaction of both their
            Majesties: But, it was the most violent Exercise I ever underwent, and yet I could not strike above sixteen
            Keys, nor, consequently, play the Bass and Treble together, as other Artists do; which was a great
            Disadvantage to my Performance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The King, who as I before observed, was a Prince of excellent Understanding, would frequently order that I
            should be brought in my Box, and set upon the Table in his Closet. He would then com-mand me to bring one of
            my Chairs out of the Box, and sit down within three Yards Distance upon the Top of the Cabinet; which
            brought me almost to a Level with his Face. In this Manner I had several Conversations with him. I one Day
            took the Freedom to tell his Majesty, that the Contempt he discovered towards <em>Europe</em>, and the rest
            of the World, did not seem answerable to those excellent Qualities of the Mind, that he was Master of. That,
            Reason did not extend itself with the Bulk of the Body: On the contrary, we observed in our Country, that
            the tallest Persons were usually least provided with it. That among other Animals, Bees and Ants had the
            Reputation of more Industry, Art, and Sagacity than many of the larger Kinds. And that, as inconsiderable as
            he took me to be, I hoped I might live to do his Majesty some signal Service. The King heard me with
            Attention; and began to conceive a much better Opin-ion of me than he had ever before. He desired I would
            give him as exact an Account of the Government of <em>England</em> as I possibly could; because, as fond as
            Princes commonly are of their own Customs (for so he conjectured of other Monarchs by my former Discourses)
            he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve Imitation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Imagine with thy self, courteous Reader, how often I then wished for the Tongue of <em>Demosthenes</em> or
            <em>Cicero</em>,* that might have enabled me to celebrate the Praise of my own dear native Country in a
            Style equal to its Merits and Felicity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I began my Discourse by informing his Majesty, that our Dominions consisted of two Islands, which composed
            three mighty Kingdoms* under one Sovereign, beside our Plantations* in <em>America</em>. I dwelt long upon
            the Fertility of our Soil, and the Tem-perature of our Climate. I then spoke at large upon the Constitution
            of an <em>English</em> Parliament, partly made up of an illustrious Body called the House of Peers, Persons
            of the noblest Blood, and of the most ancient and ample Patrimonies. I described that extraordinary Care
            always taken of their Education* in Arts and Arms, to qualify them for being Counsellors born* to the King
            and Kingdom; to have a Share in the Legislature, to be Members of the highest Court of Judicature from
            whence there could be no Appeal;* and to be Champions always ready for the Defence of their Prince and
            Country</p>

        <p>by their Valour, Conduct and Fidelity. That these were the Orna-ment and Bulwark of the Kingdom; worthy
            Followers of their most renowned Ancestors, whose Honour had been the Reward of their Virtue; from which
            their Posterity were never once known to degenerate.* To these were joined several holy Persons, as part of
            that Assembly, under the Title of Bishops; whose peculiar Business it is, to take care of Religion, and of
            those who instruct the People therein. These were searched and sought out through the whole Nation, by the
            Prince and his wisest Counsellors, among such of the Priesthood, as were most deservedly distinguished by
            the Sanctity of their Lives, and the Depth of their Erudition; who were indeed the spiritual Fathers of the
            Clergy and the People.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That, the other Part of the Parliament consisted of an Assembly called the House of Commons; who were all
            principal Gentlemen, <em>freely</em> picked and culled out by the People themselves, for their great
            Abilities, and Love of their Country, to represent the Wisdom of the whole Nation. And, these two Bodies
            make up the most august Assembly in <em>Europe</em>; to whom, in Conjunction with the Prince, the whole
            Legislature is committed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I then descended to the Courts of Justice, over which the Judges, those venerable Sages and Interpreters of
            the Law, presided, for determining the disputed Rights and Properties of Men, as well as for the Punishment
            of Vice, and Protection of Innocence. I men-tioned the prudent Management of our Treasury; the Valour and
            Atchievements of our Forces by Sea and Land. I computed the Number of our People, by reckoning how many
            Millions there might be of each Religious Sect, or Political Party amongst us. I did not omit even our
            Sports and Pastimes, or any other Particular which I thought might redound to the Honour of my Country. And,
            I fin-ished all with a brief historical Account of Aﬀairs and Events in <em>England</em> for about an
            hundred Years past.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Conversation was not ended under five Audiences, each of several Hours; and the King heard the whole
            with great Attention; frequently taking Notes of what I spoke, as well as Memorandums of several Questions
            he intended to ask me.</p>
        <p>When I had put an End to these long Discourses, his Majesty in a sixth Audience consulting his Notes,
            proposed many Doubts, Queries, and Objections, upon every Article.* He asked, what Methods were used to
            cultivate the Minds and Bodies of our young</p>

        <p>Nobility; and in what kind of Business they commonly spent the first and teachable Part of their Lives. What
            Course was taken to supply that Assembly, when any noble Family became extinct. What Qualifications were
            necessary in those who were to be created new Lords: Whether the Humour of the Prince, a Sum of Money to a
            Court-Lady, or a Prime Minister; or a Design of strengthening a Party opposite to the publick Interest, ever
            happened to be Motives in those Advancements. What Share of Knowledge these Lords had in the Laws of their
            Country, and how they came by it, so as to enable them to decide the Properties of their Fellow-Subjects in
            the last Resort. Whether they were always so free from Avarice, Partialities, or Want, that a Bribe, or some
            other sinister View, could have no Place among them. Whether those holy Lords I spoke of, were always
            promoted to that Rank upon Account of their Knowledge in religious Matters, and the Sanctity of their Lives,
            had never been Compliers with the Times, while they were common Priests; or slavish prostitute Chaplains to
            some Nobleman,* whose Opinions they continued servilely to follow after they were admitted into that
            Assembly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He then desired to know, what Arts were practiced in electing those whom I called Commoners. Whether, a
            Stranger with a strong Purse might not influence the vulgar Voters to chuse him before their own Landlord,
            or the most considerable Gentleman in the Neighbourhood. How it came to pass, that People were so violently
            bent upon getting into this Assembly, which I allowed to be a great Trouble and Expence, often to the Ruin
            of their Families, without any Salary or Pension: Because this appeared such an exalted Strain of Virtue and
            publick Spirit, that his Majesty seemed to doubt it might possibly not be always sincere: And he desired to
            know, whether such zealous Gentlemen could have any Views of refunding themselves for the Charges and
            Trouble they were at, by sacrificing the publick Good to the Designs of a weak and vicious Prince, in
            Conjunction with a corrupted Ministry. He multiplied his Questions, and sifted* me thoroughly upon every
            Part of this Head; proposing numberless Enquiries and Objections, which I think it not prudent or convenient
            to repeat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Upon what I said in relation to our Courts of Justice, his Majesty desired to be satisfied in several Points:
            And this I was the better able to do, having been formerly almost ruined by a long Suit in</p>

        <p>Chancery, which was decreed for me with Costs. He asked, what Time was usually spent in determining between
            Right and Wrong; and what Degree of Expence. Whether Advocates and Orators had Liberty to plead in Causes
            manifestly known to be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive. Whether Party in Religion or Politicks were
            observed to be of any Weight in the Scale of Justice. Whether those pleading Orators were Persons educated
            in the general Knowledge of Equity; or only in provincial, national, and other local Customs. Whether they
            or their Judges had any Part in penning those Laws, which they assumed the Liberty of interpreting and
            glossing upon at their Pleasure. Whether they had ever at diﬀerent Times pleaded for and against the same
            Cause, and cited Precedents to prove contrary Opinions. Whether they were a rich or a poor Corporation.
            Whether they received any pecuniary Reward for pleading or delivering their Opinions. And particularly
            whether they were ever admitted as Members in the lower Senate.</p>

        <p>He fell next upon the Management of our Treasury; and said, he thought my Memory had failed me, because I
            computed our Taxes at about five or six Millions a Year; and when I came to mention the Issues,* he found
            they sometimes amounted to more than double; for, the Notes he had taken were very particular in this Point;
            because he hoped, as he told me, that the Knowledge of our Con-duct might be useful to him; and he could not
            be deceived in his Calculations. But, if what I told him were true, he was still at a Loss how a Kingdom
            could run out of its Estate like a private Person.* He asked me, who were our Creditors? and, where we found
            Money to pay them? He wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable* and extensive Wars; that, certainly we
            must be a quarrelsome People, or live among very bad Neighbours; and that our Generals must needs be richer
            than our Kings.* He asked, what Business we had out of our own Islands, unless upon the Score of Trade or
            Treaty, or to defend the Coasts with our Fleet. Above all, he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary
            standing Army* in the Midst of Peace, and among a free People. He said, if we were governed by our own
            Consent in the Persons of our Representatives, he could not imagine of whom we were afraid, or against whom
            we were to fight; and would hear my Opinion, whether a private Man&rsquo;s House might not better be
            defended by himself, his Children, and Family; than by half a Dozen Rascals picked up at a Venture in the
            Streets, for small</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He laughed at my odd Kind of Arithmetick* (as he was pleased to call it) in reckoning the Numbers of our
            People by a Computation drawn from the several Sects among us in Religion and Politicks. He said, he knew no
            Reason,* why those who entertain Opinions preju-dicial to the Publick, should be obliged to change, or
            should not be obliged to conceal them. And, as it was Tyranny in any Government to require the first, so it
            was Weakness not to enforce the second: For, a Man may be allowed to keep Poisons in his Closet, but not to
            vend them about as Cordials.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He observed, that among the Diversions of our Nobility and Gentry, I had mentioned Gaming.* He desired to
            know at what Age this Entertainment was usually taken up, and when it was laid down. How much of their Time
            it employed; whether it ever went so high as to aﬀect their Fortunes. Whether mean vicious People, by their
            Dexterity in that Art, might not arrive at great Riches, and some-times keep our very Nobles in Dependance,
            as well as habituate them to vile Companions; wholly take them from the Improvement of their Minds, and
            force them by the Losses they have received, to learn and practice that infamous Dexterity upon others.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was perfectly astonished with the historical Account I gave him of our Aﬀairs during the last Century;
            protesting it was only an Heap of Conspiracies, Rebellions, Murders, Massacres, Revolutions, Banishments;
            the very worst Eﬀects that Avarice, Faction, Hypocrisy, Perfidiousness, Cruelty, Rage, Madness, Hatred,
            Envy, Lust, Malice, and Ambition could produce.</p>

        <p>His Majesty in another Audience, was at the Pains to recapitulate the Sum of all I had spoken; compared the
            Questions he made, with the Answers I had given; then taking me into his Hands, and stroak-ing me gently,
            delivered himself in these Words, which I shall never forget, nor the Manner he spoke them in. My little
            Friend <em>Grildrig</em>; you have made a most admirable Panegyric upon your Country. You have clearly
            proved that Ignorance, Idleness, and Vice are the proper Ingredients for qualifying a Legislator. That Laws
            are best explained, interpreted, and applied by those whose Interest and Abilities lie in perverting,
            confounding, and eluding them. I observe among you some Lines of an Institution, which in its Original might
            have been tolerable; but these half erased, and the rest wholly blurred</p>

            towards the Procurement of any one Station among you; much less that Men are ennobled on Account of their
            Virtue, that Priests are advanced for their Piety or Learning, Soldiers for their Conduct or Valour, Judges
            for their Integrity, Senators for the Love of their Country, or Counsellors for their Wisdom. As for
            yourself (continued the King) who have spent the greatest Part of your Life in travelling; I am well
            disposed to hope you may hitherto have escaped many Vices of your Country. But, by what I have gathered from
            your own Relation, and the Answers I have with much Pains wringed and extorted from you; I cannot but
            conclude the Bulk of your Natives, to be the most perni-cious Race of little odious Vermin that Nature ever

        <p>N ot h i n g but an extreme Love of Truth could have hindered me from concealing this Part of my Story. It
            was in vain to discover my Resentments, which were always turned into Ridicule: And I was forced to rest
            with Patience, while my noble and most beloved Country was so injuriously treated. I am heartily sorry as
            any of my Readers can possibly be, that such an Occasion was given: But this Prince happened to be so
            curious and inquisitive upon every Particu-lar, that it could not consist either with Gratitude or good
            Manners to refuse giving him what Satisfaction I was able. Yet thus much I may be allowed to say in my own
            Vindication; that I artfully eluded many of his Questions, and gave to every Point a more favourable turn by
            many Degrees than the strictness of Truth would allow. For, I have always born that laudable Partiality to
            my own Country, which <em>Dionysius Halicarnassensis</em>* with so much Justice recommends to an Historian.
            I would hide the Frailties and Deformities of my Political Mother, and place her Virtues and Beauties in the
            most advanta-geous Light. This was my sincere Endeavour in those many Discourses I had with that Monarch,
            although it unfortunately failed of Success.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, great Allowances should be given to a King who lives wholly secluded from the rest of the World, and
            must therefore be altogether unacquainted with the Manners and Customs that most prevail in other Nations:
            The want of which Knowledge will ever produce many <em>Prejudices</em>,* and a certain <em>Narrowness of
                Thinking</em>; from which we and the politer Countries of <em>Europe</em> are wholly exempted. And it
            would be hard indeed, if so remote a Prince&rsquo;s Notions of Virtue and Vice were to be oﬀered as a
            Standard for all Mankind.</p>

        <p>To confirm what I have now said, and further to shew the miser-able Eﬀects of a

        <p>which will hardly obtain Belief. In hopes to ingratiate my self farther into his Majesty&rsquo;s Favour, I
            told him of an Invention discovered between three and four hundred Years ago,* to make a certain Powder;
            into an heap of which the smallest Spark of Fire falling, would kindle the whole in a Moment, although it
            were as big as a Mountain; and make it all fly up in the Air together, with a Noise and Agitation greater
            than Thunder. That, a proper Quantity of this Powder rammed into a hollow Tube of Brass or Iron, according
            to its Bigness, would drive a Ball of Iron or Lead with such Violence and Speed, as nothing was able to
            sustain its Force. That, the largest Balls thus discharged, would not only Destroy whole Ranks of an Army at
            once; but batter the strongest Walls to the Ground; sink down Ships with a thousand Men in each, to the
            Bottom of the Sea; and when linked together by a Chain, would cut through Masts and Rigging; divide Hundreds
            of Bodies in the Middle, and lay all Waste before them. That we often put this Powder into large hollow
            Balls of Iron, and discharged them by an Engine into some City we were besieging; which would rip up the
            Pavement, tear the Houses to Pieces, burst and throw Splinters on every Side, dashing out the Brains of all
            who came near. That I knew the Ingredients very well, which were Cheap, and common; I understood the Manner
            of com-pounding them, and could direct his Workmen how to make those Tubes of a Size proportionable to all
            other Things in his Majesty&rsquo;s Kingdom; and the largest need not be above a hundred Foot long; twenty
            or thirty of which Tubes, charged with the proper Quantity of Powder and Balls, would batter down the Walls
            of the strongest Town in his Dominions in a few Hours; or destroy the whole Metropolis, if ever it should
            pretend to dispute his absolute Commands. This I humbly oﬀered to his Majesty, as a small Tribute of
            Acknowledgment in return of so many Marks that I had received of his Royal Favour and Protection.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The King was struck with Horror at the Description I had given of those terrible Engines, and the Proposal I
            had made. He was amazed how so impotent and groveling an Insect as I (these were his Expressions) could
            entertain such inhuman Ideas, and in so familiar a Manner as to appear wholly unmoved at all the Scenes of
            Blood and Desolation, which I had painted as the com-mon Eﬀects of those destructive Machines; whereof he
            said, some evil Genius, Enemy to Mankind, must have been the first</p>

        <p>Contriver. As for himself, he protested that although few Things delighted him so much as new Discoveries in
            Art or in Nature; yet he would rather lose Half his Kingdom than be privy to such a Secret; which he
            commanded me, as I valued my Life, never to mention any more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A strange Eﬀect of <em>narrow Principles</em> and <em>short Views!</em> that a Prince possessed of every
            Quality which procures Veneration, Love and Esteem; of strong Parts, great Wisdom and profound Learning;
            endued with admirable Talents for Government, and almost adored by his Subjects; should from a <em>nice
                unnecessary Scruple</em>, whereof in <em>Europe</em> we can have no Conception, let slip an Opportunity
            to put into his Hands, that would have made him absolute Master of the Lives, the Liberties, and the
            Fortunes of his People. Neither do I say this with the least Intention to detract from the many Virtues of
            that excellent King; whose Character I am sensible will on this Account be very much lessened in the Opinion
            of an <em>English</em> Reader: But, I take this Defect among them to have risen from their Ignorance; they
            not having hitherto reduced <em>Politicks</em> into a <em>Science</em>,* as the more acute Wits of
            <em>Europe</em> have done. For, I remember very well, in a Discourse one Day with the King; when I happened
            to say, there were several thousand Books among us written upon the <em>Art of Government</em> ; it gave him
            (directly contrary to my Intention) a very mean Opinion of our Understandings. He professed both to
            abominate and despise all <em>Mystery, Re</em><em>fi</em><em>nement</em>, and <em>Intrigue</em>, either in a
            Prince or a Minister. He could not tell what I meant by <em>Secrets of State</em>, where an Enemy or some
            Rival Nation were not in the Case. He confined the Know-ledge of governing within very <em>narrow
                Bounds</em>; to common Sense and Reason, to Justice and Lenity, to the Speedy Determination of Civil and
            criminal Causes; with some other obvious Topicks which are not worth considering. And, he gave it for his
            Opinion;* that whoever could make two Ears of Corn, or two Blades of Grass to grow upon a Spot of Ground
            where only one grew before; would deserve better of Mankind, and do more essential Service to his Country,
            than the whole Race of Politicians put together.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Learning of this People is very defective; consisting only in Morality, History, Poetry and Mathematicks;
            wherein they must be allowed to excel. But, the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful in
            Life; to the Improvement of Agriculture and all mechan-ical Arts; so that among us it would be little
            esteemed. And as to</p>

        <p>No Law* of that Country must exceed in Words the Number of Letters in their Alphabet; which consists only of
            two and twenty. But indeed, few of them extend even to that Length. They are expressed in the most plain and
            simple Terms, wherein those People are not Mercurial enough to discover above one Interpretation. And, to
            write a Comment upon any Law, is a capital Crime. As to the Decision of civil Causes, or Proceedings against
            Criminals, their Precedents are so few, that they have little Reason to boast of any extraordinary Skill in
            either.</p>

        <p>They have had the Art of Printing,* as well as the <em>Chinese</em>, Time out of Mind. But their Libraries
            are not very large;* for that of the King&rsquo;s which is reckoned the largest, doth not amount to above a
            thousand Volumes; placed in a Gallery of twelve hundred Foot long; from which I had Liberty to borrow what
            Books I pleased. The Queen&rsquo;s Joyner had contrived in one of <em>Glumdalclitch</em>&rsquo;s Rooms a
            Kind of wooden Machine five and twenty Foot high, formed like a standing Ladder; the steps were each fifty
            Foot long: It was indeed a moveable Pair of Stairs, the lowest End placed at ten Foot Distance from the Wall
            of the Chamber. The Book I had a Mind to read was put up leaning against the Wall. I first mounted to the
            upper Step of the Ladder, and turning my Face towards the Book, began at the Top of the Page, and so walking
            to the Right and Left about eight or ten Paces according to the Length of the Lines, till I had gotten a
            little below the Level of mine Eyes; and then descending gradually till I came to the Bottom: After which I
            mounted again, and began the other Page in the same Manner, and so turned over the Leaf, which I could
            easily do with both my Hands, for it was as thick and stiﬀ as Paste-board, and in the largest Folio&rsquo;s
            not above eighteen or twenty Foot long.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their Stile* is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not Florid; for they avoid nothing more than multiplying
            unnecessary Words, or using various Expressions. I have perused many of their Books, espe-cially those in
            History and Morality. Among the latter I was much diverted with a little old Treatise, which always lay in
            <em>Glumdalclitch</em>&rsquo;s Bedchamber, and belonged to her Governess, a grave elderly Gentlewoman, who
            dealt in Writings of Morality and Devotion. The Book treats of the Weakness of Human kind; and is in little

        <p>except among the Women and the Vulgar. However, I was curious to see what an Author of that Country could say
            upon such a Subject. This Writer went through all the usual Topicks of <em>European</em> Moralists; shewing
            how diminutive, contemptible, and helpless an Animal was Man in his own Nature; how unable to defend himself
            from the Inclemencies of the Air, or the Fury of wild Beasts: How much he was excelled by one Creature in
            Strength, by another in Speed, by a third in Foresight, by a fourth in Industry. He added, that Nature was
            degenerated* in these latter declining Ages of the World, and could now produce only small abortive Births
            in Comparison of those in ancient Times. He said, it was very reasonable to think, not only that the Species
            of Men were originally much larger, but also that there must have been Giants in former Ages; which, as it
            is asserted by History and Tradition, so it has been confirmed by huge Bones and Sculls casually dug up* in
            several Parts of the Kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled Race of Man in our Days. He argued, that the
            very Laws of Nature absolutely required we should have been made in the Beginning, of a Size more large and
            robust, not so liable to Destruction from every little Accident of a Tile falling* from an House, or a Stone
            cast from the Hand of a Boy, or of being drowned in a little Brook. From this Way of Reasoning the Author
            drew several moral Applications useful in the Conduct of Life, but needless here to repeat. For my own Part,
            I could not avoid reflecting how universally this Talent was spread of drawing Lectures in Morality, or
            indeed rather Matter of Discontent and repining, from the Quarrels we raise with Nature. And, I believe upon
            a strict Enquiry, those Quarrels might be shewn as ill-grounded among us, as they are among that People.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As to their military Aﬀairs; they boast that the King&rsquo;s Army consists of a hundred and seventy six
            thousand Foot, and thirty two thousand Horse: If that may be called an Army which is made up of Tradesmen*
            in the several Cities, and Farmers in the Coun-try, whose Commanders are only the Nobility and Gentry,
            without Pay or Reward. They are indeed perfect enough in their Exercises; and under very good Discipline,
            wherein I saw no great Merit: For, how should it be otherwise, where every Farmer is under the Command of
            his own Landlord, and every Citizen under that of the principal Men in his own City, chosen after the Manner
            of <em>Venice</em>* by <em>Ballot</em>?</p>

        <p>I have often seen the Militia of <em>Lorbrulgrud</em> drawn out to Exercise in a great Field near the City,
            of twenty Miles Square. They were in all not above twenty five thousand Foot, and six thousand Horse; but it
            was impossible for me to compute their Number, considering the Space of Ground they took up. A
            <em>Cavalier</em> mounted on a large Steed might be about Ninety Foot high. I have seen this whole Body of
            Horse upon a Word of Command draw their Swords at once, and brandish them in the Air. Imagination can Figure
            nothing so Grand,* so surprising and so astonishing. It looked as if ten thousand Flashes of Lightning were
            darting at the same time from every Quarter of the Sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was curious to know how this Prince, to whose Dominions there is no Access from any other Country, came to
            think of Armies, or to teach his People the Practice of military Discipline. But I was soon informed, both
            by Conversation, and Reading their Histories. For, in the Course of many Ages they have been troubled with
            the same Disease,* to which the whole Race of Mankind is Subject; the Nobility often contending for Power,
            the People for Liberty, and the King for absolute Dominion. All which, however happily tempered by the Laws
            of that Kingdom, have been sometimes violated by each of the three Parties; and have once or more occasioned
            Civil Wars, the last whereof was happily put an End to by this Prince&rsquo;s Grandfather by a general
            Composition;* and the Militia then settled with common Consent has been ever since kept in the strictest
            Duty.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I h a d always a strong Impulse that I should some time recover my Liberty, although it were impossible to
            conjecture by what Means, or to form any Project with the least Hope of succeeding. The Ship in which I
            sailed was the first ever known to be driven within Sight of that Coast; and the King had given strict
            Orders, that if at any Time another appeared, it should be taken ashore, and with all its Crew and
            Passengers brought in a Tumbril to <em>Lorbrulgrud</em>. He was strongly bent to get me a Woman of my own
            Size, by whom I might propagate the Breed: But I think I should rather have died than undergone the Disgrace
            of leaving a Posterity to be kept in Cages like tame Canary Birds,* and perhaps in time sold about the
            Kingdom to Persons of Quality for Curiosities. I was indeed treated with much Kindness; I was the Favourite
            of a great King and Queen, and the Delight of the whole Court; but it was upon such a Foot as ill became the
            Dignity of human Kind. I could never forget those domestick Pledges I had left behind me. I wanted to be
            among People with whom I could converse upon even* Terms; and walk about the Streets and Fields without Fear
            of being trod to Death like a Frog or a young Puppy. But, my Deliverance came sooner than I expected, and in
            a Manner not very common: The whole Story and Circumstances of which I shall faithfully relate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had now been two Years in this Country; and, about the Beginning of the third, <em>Glumdalclitch</em> and I
            attended the King and Queen in a Progress to the South Coast of the Kingdom. I was carried as usual in my
            Travelling-Box, which, as I have already described, was a very convenient Closet of twelve Foot wide. And I
            had ordered a Hammock to be fixed by silken Ropes from the four Corners at the Top; to break the Jolts, when
            a Servant carried me before him on Horseback, as I sometimes desired; and would often sleep in my Hammock
            while we were upon the Road. On the Roof of my Closet, set not directly over the Middle of the</p>

        <p>Hammock, I ordered the Joyner to cut out a Hole of a Foot square to give me Air in hot Weather as I slept;
            which Hole I shut at pleasure with a Board that drew backwards and forwards through a Groove.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When we came to our Journey&rsquo;s End, the King thought proper to pass a few Days at a Palace he has near
            <em>Flan</em><em>fl</em><em>asnic</em>, a City within eighteen <em>English</em> Miles of the Sea-side.
            <em>Glumdalclitch</em> and I were much fatigued: I had gotten a small Cold; but the poor Girl was so ill as
            to be confined to her Chamber. I longed to see the Ocean, which must be the only scene of my Escape, if ever
            it should happen. I pretended to be worse than I really was; and desired leave to take the fresh Air of the
            Sea, with a Page whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with me. I shall never forget
            with what Unwillingness <em>Glumdalclitch</em> consented; nor the strict Charge she gave the Page to be
            careful of me; bursting at the same time into a Flood of Tears, as if she had some Foreboding of what was to
            happen. The Boy took me out in my Box about Half an Hour&rsquo;s Walk from the Palace, towards the Rocks on
            the Sea-shore. I ordered him to set me down; and lifting up one of my Sashes, cast many a wistful
            melan-choly Look towards the Sea.* I found myself not very well; and told the Page that I had a Mind to take
            a Nap in my Hammock, which I hoped would do me good. I got in, and the Boy shut the Window close down, to
            keep out the Cold. I soon fell asleep: And all I can conjecture is, that while I slept, the Page thinking no
            Danger could happen, went among the Rocks to look for Birds Eggs; having before observed him from my Window
            searching about, and picking up one or two in the Clefts. Be that as it will; I found myself suddenly awaked
            with a violent Pull upon the Ring which was fastened at the Top of my Box, for the Conveniency of Carriage.
            I felt my Box raised very high in the Air, and then born forward with prodigious Speed. The first Jolt had
            like to have shaken me out of my Hammock; but afterwards the Motion was easy enough. I called out several
            times as loud as I could raise my Voice, but all to no purpose. I looked towards my Windows, and could see
            nothing but the Clouds and Sky. I heard a Noise just over my Head like the clapping of Wings; and then began
            to perceive the woful Condition I was in; that some Eagle* had got the Ring of my Box in his Beak, with an
            Intent to let it fall on a Rock, like a Tortoise* in a Shell, and then pick out my Body and devour it. For

        <p>him to discover his Quarry at a great Distance, though better concealed than I could be within a two Inch
            Board.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a little time I observed the Noise and flutter of Wings to encrease very fast; and my Box was tossed up
            and down like a Sign-post on a windy Day. I heard several Bangs or Buﬀets, as I thought, given to the Eagle
            (for such I am certain it must have been that held the Ring of my Box in his Beak) and then all on a sudden
            felt my self falling perpendicularly down for above a Minute; but with such incredible Swiftness that I
            almost lost my Breath. My Fall was stopped by a terrible Squash,* that sounded louder to mine Ears than the
            Cataract of <em>Niagara</em>; after which I was quite in the Dark for another Minute, and then my Box began
            to rise so high that I could see Light from the Tops of my Windows. I now perceived that I was fallen into
            the Sea.* My Box, by the Weight of my Body, the Goods that were in, and the broad Plates of Iron fixed for
            Strength at the four Corners of the Top and Bottom, floated five Foot deep in Water. I did then, and do now
            suppose, that the Eagle which flew away with my Box was pursued by two or three others, and forced to let me
            drop while he was defending himself against the Rest, who hoped to share in the Prey. The Plates of Iron
            fastned at the Bottom of the Box, (for those were the strongest) preserved the Balance while it fell; and
            hindred it from being broken on the Surface of the Water. Every Joint of it was well grooved, and the Door
            did not move on Hinges, but up and down like a Sash; which kept my Closet so tight that very little Water
            came in. I got with much Diﬃculty out of my Hammock, having first ventured to draw back the Slip board on
            the Roof already mentioned, contrived on purpose to let in Air; for want of which I found myself almost
            stifled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How often did I then wish my self with my dear <em>Glumdalclitch</em>, from whom one single Hour had so far
            divided me! And I may say with Truth, that in the midst of my own Misfortune, I could not forbear lamenting
            my poor Nurse, the Grief she would suﬀer for my Loss, the Displeasure of the Queen, and the Ruin of her
            Fortune. Perhaps many Travellers have not been under greater Diﬃculties and Distress than I was at this
            Juncture; expecting every Moment to see my Box dashed in Pieces, or at least overset by the first violent
            Blast, or a rising Wave. A Breach in one single Pane of Glass would have been immediate Death: Nor could any
            thing have preserved the Windows but the strong Lattice Wires placed on the outside against</p>

        <p>Accidents in Travelling. I saw the Water ooze in at several Crannies, although the Leaks were not
            considerable; and I endeavoured to stop them as well as I could. I was not able to lift up the Roof of my
            Closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done, and sat on the Top of it, where I might at least
            preserve myself from being shut up, as I may call it, in the Hold. Or, if I escaped these Dangers for a Day
            or two, what could I expect but a miserable Death of Cold and Hunger! I was four Hours under these
            Circumstances, expecting and indeed wishing every Moment to be my last.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have already told the Reader, that there were two strong Staples fixed upon that Side of my Box which had
            no Window, and into which the Servant, who used to carry me on Horseback, would put a Leathern Belt, and
            buckle it about his Waist. Being in this discon-solate State, I heard, or at least thought I heard some kind
            of grating Noise on that Side of my Box where the Staples were fixed; and soon after I began to fancy that
            the Box was pulled, or towed along in the Sea; for I now and then felt a sort of tugging, which made the
            Waves rise near the Tops of my Windows, leaving me almost in the Dark. This gave me some faint Hopes of
            Relief, although I were not able to imagine how it could be brought about. I ventured to unscrew one of my
            Chairs, which were always fastned to the Floor; and having made a hard shift to screw it down again directly
            under the Slipping-board that I had lately opened; I mounted on the Chair, and putting my Mouth as near as I
            could to the Hole, I called for Help in a loud Voice, and in all the Languages I understood. I then fastned
            my Handkerchief to a Stick I usually carried, and thrusting it up the Hole, waved it several times in the
            Air; that if any Boat or Ship were near, the Seamen might conjecture some unhappy Mortal to be shut up in
            the Box.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I found no Eﬀect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my Closet to be moved along; and in the Space of
            an Hour, or better,* that Side of the Box where the Staples were, and had no Window, struck against
            something that was hard. I apprehended it to be a Rock, and found my self tossed more than ever. I plainly
            heard a Noise upon the Cover of my Closet, like that of a Cable, and the grating of it as it passed through
            the Ring. I then found my self hoisted up by Degrees at least three Foot higher than I was before.
            Whereupon, I again thrust up my Stick and Handkerchief, calling for Help till I was almost hoarse. In return
            to which, I heard a great</p>

        <p>Shout repeated three times, giving me such Transports of Joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel
            them. I now heard a trampling over my Head; and somebody calling through the Hole with a loud Voice in the
            <em>English</em> Tongue: <em>If there be any Body below, let them speak</em>. I answered, I was an
            <em>Englishman</em>, drawn by ill Fortune into the greatest Calamity that ever any Creature underwent; and
            begged, by all that was moving,* to be delivered out of the Dungeon I was in. The Voice replied, I was safe,
            for my Box was fastned to their Ship; and the Carpenter should immediately come, and saw an Hole in the
            Cover, large enough to pull me out. I answered, that was needless, and would take up too much Time; for
            there was no more to be done, but let one of the Crew put his Finger into the Ring, and take the Box out of
            the Sea into the Ship, and so into the Captain&rsquo;s Cabbin. Some of them upon hearing me talk so wildly,
            thought I was mad; others laughed; for indeed it never came into my Head, that I was now among People of my
            own Stature and Strength. The Carpenter came, and in a few Minutes sawed a Passage about four Foot square;
            then let down a small Ladder, upon which I mounted, and from thence was taken into the Ship in a very weak
            Condition.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sailors were all in Amazement, and asked me a thousand Questions, which I had no Inclination to answer. I
            was equally con-founded at the Sight of so many Pigmies; for such I took them to be, after having so long
            accustomed mine Eyes to the monstrous Objects I had left. But the Captain, Mr <em>Thomas Wilcocks</em>, an
            honest worthy <em>Shropshire</em> Man, observing I was ready to faint, took me into his Cabbin, gave me a
            Cordial to comfort me, and made me <em>turn in</em> upon his own Bed; advising me to take a little Rest, of
            which I had great need. Before I went to sleep I gave him to understand, that I had some valuable Furniture
            in my Box too good to be lost; a fine Hammock, an handsome Field-Bed, two Chairs, a Table, and a Cabinet:
            That my Closet was hung on all Sides, or rather quilted, with Silk and Cotton: That if he would let one of
            the Crew bring my Closet into his Cabbin, I would open it there before him, and shew him my Goods. The
            Captain hearing me utter these Absurdities, concluded I was raving: However, (I suppose to pacify me) he
            prom-ised to give Order as I desired; and going upon Deck, sent some of his Men down into my Closet, from
            whence (as I afterwards found) they drew up all my Goods, and stripped oﬀ the Quilting; but the Chairs,
            Cabinet, and Bed-sted being screwed to the Floor, were</p>

        <p>much damaged by the Ignorance of the Seamen, who tore them up by Force. Then they knocked oﬀ some of the
            Boards for the Use of the Ship; and when they had got all they had a Mind for, let the Hulk drop into the
            Sea, which by Reason of many Breaches made in the Bottom and Sides, sunk <em>to rights</em>.* And indeed I
            was glad not to have been a Spectator of the Havock they made; because I am confident it would have sensibly
            touched me, by bringing former Passages* into my Mind, which I had rather forget.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I slept some Hours, but perpetually disturbed with Dreams of the Place I had left, and the Dangers I had
            escaped. However, upon waking I found myself much recovered. It was now about eight a Clock at Night, and
            the Captain ordered Supper immediately, think-ing I had already fasted too long. He entertained me with
            great Kindness, observing me not to look wildly, or talk inconsistently; and when we were left alone,
            desired I would give him a Relation of my Travels, and by what Accident I came to be set adrift in that
            mon-strous wooden Chest. He said, that about twelve a Clock at Noon, as he was looking through his Glass, he
            spied it at a Distance, and thought it was a Sail, which he had a Mind to make;* being not much out of his
            Course, in hopes of buying some Biscuit, his own begin-ning to fall short. That, upon coming nearer, and
            finding his Error, he sent out his Long-boat to discover what I was; that his Men came back in a Fright,
            swearing they had seen a swimming House. That he laughed at their Folly, and went himself in the Boat,
            ordering his Men to take a strong Cable along with them. That the Weather being calm, he rowed round me
            several times, observed my Windows, and the Wire Lattices that defended them. That he discovered two Staples
            upon one Side, which was all of Boards, without any Passage for Light. He then commanded his Men to row up
            to that Side; and fastning a Cable to one of the Staples, ordered his Men to tow my Chest (as he called it)
            towards the Ship. When it was there, he gave Directions to fasten another Cable to the Ring fixed in the
            Cover, and to raise up my Chest with Pullies, which all the Sailors were not able to do above two or three
            Foot. He said, they saw my Stick and Handkerchief thrust out of the Hole, and concluded, that some unhappy
            Men must be shut up in the Cavity. I asked whether he or the Crew had seen any prodigious Birds in the Air
            about the Time he first discovered me: To which he answered, that discoursing this Matter with the Sailors
            while I was asleep, one of them said he had</p>

        <p><em>observed</em> three Eagles flying towards the North: but remarked nothing of their being larger than the
            usual Size; which I suppose must be imputed to the great Height they were at: And he could not guess the
            Reason of my Question. I then asked the Captain how far he reckoned we might be from Land; he said, by the
            best Computation he could make, we were at least a hundred Leagues. I assured him, that he must be mistaken
            by almost half; for I had not left the Country from whence I came, above two Hours before I dropt into the
            Sea. Whereupon he began again to think that my Brain was disturbed, of which he gave me a Hint, and advised
            me to go to Bed in a Cabin he had provided. I assured him I was well refreshed with his good Entertainment
            and Company, and as much in my Senses as ever I was in my Life. He then grew serious, and desired to ask me
            freely whether I were not troubled in Mind by the Consciousness of some enormous Crime, for which I was
            punished at the Command of some Prince, by exposing me in that Chest; as great Criminals in other Countries
            have been forced to Sea in a leaky Vessel without Provisions: For, although he should be sorry to have taken
            so ill a Man into his Ship, yet he would engage his Word to set me safe on Shore in the first Port where we
            arrived. He added, that his Suspicions were much increased by some very absurd Speeches I had delivered at
            first to the Sailors, and afterwards to himself, in relation to my Closet or Chest, as well as by my odd
            Looks and Behaviour while I was at Supper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I begged his Patience to hear me tell my Story; which I faithfully did from the last Time I left
            <em>England</em>, to the Moment he first dis-covered me. And, as Truth always forceth its Way into rational
            Minds; so, this honest worthy Gentleman, who had some Tincture of Learning, and very good Sense, was
            immediately convinced of my Candor and Veracity. But, further to confirm all I had said, I entreated him to
            give Order that my Cabinet should be brought, of which I had the Key in my Pocket, (for he had already
            informed me of how the Seamen disposed of my Closet) I opened it in his Presence, and shewed him the small
            Collection of Rarities I made in the Coun-try from whence I had been so strangely delivered. There was a
            Comb I had contrived out of the Stumps of the King&rsquo;s Beard; and another of the same Materials, but
            fixed into a paring of her Majesty&rsquo;s Thumb-nail, which served for the Back. There was a Collection of
            Needles and Pins from a Foot to half a Yard long. Four</p>

        <p>Wasp-Stings, like Joyners Tacks: Some Combings of the Queen&rsquo;s Hair: A Gold Ring which one Day she made
            me a Present of in a most obliging Manner, taking it from her little Finger, and throwing it over my Head
            like a Collar. I desired the Captain would please to accept this Ring in Return of his Civilities; which he
            absolutely refused. I shewed him a Corn that I had cut oﬀ with my own Hand from a Maid of Honour&rsquo;s
            Toe; it was about the Bigness of a <em>Kentish</em> Pippin, and grown so hard, that when I returned to
            <em>England</em>, I got it hollowed into a Cup and set in Silver. Lastly, I desired him to see the Breeches
            I had then on, which were made of a Mouse&rsquo;s Skin.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I could force nothing on him but a Footman&rsquo;s Tooth, which I observed him to examine with great
            Curiosity, and found he had a Fancy for it. He received it with abundance of Thanks, more than such a Trifle
            could deserve. It was drawn by an unskilful Surgeon in a Mistake from one of <em>Glumdalclitch</em>&rsquo;s
            Men, who was aﬄicted with the Tooth-ach; but it was as sound as any in his Head. I got it cleaned, and put
            it into my Cabinet. It was about a Foot long, and four Inches in Diameter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Captain was very well satisfied with this plain Relation I had given him; and said, he hoped when we
            returned to <em>England</em>, I would oblige the World by putting it in Paper, and making it publick. My
            Answer was, that I thought we were already over-stocked with Books of Travels: That nothing could now pass
            which was not extraordin-ary; wherein I doubted, some Authors less consulted Truth than their own Vanity or
            Interest, or the Diversion of ignorant Readers. That my Story could contain little besides common Events,
            without those ornamental Descriptions of strange Plants, Trees, Birds, and other Animals; or the barbarous
            Customs and Idolatry of savage People, with which most Writers abound. However, I thanked him for his good
            Opinion, and promised to take the matter into my Thoughts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He said, he wondered at one Thing very much; which was, to hear me speak so loud; asking me whether the King
            or Queen of that Country were thick of Hearing. I told him it was what I had been used to for above two
            Years past; and that I admired as much at the Voices of him and his Men, who seemed to me only to whisper,
            and yet I could hear them well enough. But, when I spoke in that Country, it was like a Man talking in the
            Street to another looking out from the Top of a Steeple, unless when I was placed on a Table,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>136&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>or held in any person&rsquo;s Hand. I told him, I had likewise observed another Thing; that when I first got
            into the Ship, and the Sailors stood all about me, I thought they were the most little contemptible
            Creatures I had ever beheld. For, indeed, while I was in that Prince&rsquo;s Country, I could never endure
            to look in a Glass after mine Eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious Objects; because the Com-parison
            gave me so despicable a Conceit of my self. The Captain said, that while we were at Supper, he observed me
            to look at every thing with a Sort of Wonder; and that I often seemed hardly able to contain my Laughter;
            which he knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some Disorder in my Brain. I answered, it was very
            true; and I wondered how I could forbear, when I saw his Dishes of the Size of a Silver Three-pence, a Leg
            of Pork hardly a Mouthful, a Cup not so big as a Nutshell: And so I went on, describing the rest of his
            Household-stuﬀ and Provisions after the same Manner. For although the Queen had ordered a little Equipage of
            all Things necessary for me while I was in her Service; yet my Ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on
            every Side of me; and I winked at my own Littleness, as People do at their own Faults. The Captain
            understood my Raillery very well, and merrily replied with the old <em>English</em> proverb, that he
            doubted, mine Eyes were bigger than my Belly; for he did not observe my Stomach so good, although I had
            fasted all Day: And continuing in his Mirth, protested he would have gladly given a Hundred Pounds to have
            seen my Closet in the Eagle&rsquo;s Bill, and afterwards in its Fall from so great a Height into the Sea;
            which would certainly have been a most astonishing Object, worthy to have the Description of it transmitted
            to future Ages: And the Comparison of <em>Phaeton</em>* was so obvious, that he could not forbear applying
            it, although I did not much admire the Conceit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Captain having been at <em>Tonquin</em>,* was in his Return to <em>England</em> driven North Eastward to
            the Latitude of 44 Degrees, and of Longitude 143. But meeting a Trade Wind two Days after I came on board
            him, we sailed Southward a long Time, and coasting <em>New-Holland</em>,* kept our Course West-south-west,
            and then South-south-west till we doubled the <em>Cape of Good Hope</em>. Our Voyage was very prosperous,
            but I shall not trouble the Reader with a Journal of it. The Captain called in at one or two Ports, and sent
            in his Long-boat for Provisions and fresh Water; but I never went out of the Ship till we came into the
            <em>Downs</em>, which was on the 3d Day of <em>June</em> 1706,</p>

        <p>about nine Months after my Escape. I oﬀered to leave my Goods in Security for Payment of my Freight; but the
            Captain protested he would not receive one Farthing. We took kind Leave of each other; and I made him
            promise he would come to see me at my House in <em>Redri</em><em>ﬀ</em>. I hired a Horse and Guide for five
            Shillings, which I bor-rowed of the Captain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As I was on the Road; observing the Littleness of the Houses, the Trees, the Cattle and the People, I began
            to think my self in <em>Lilliput</em>. I was afraid of trampling on every Traveller I met; and often called
            aloud to have them stand out of the Way; so that I had like to have gotten one or two broken heads for my
            Impertinence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I came to my own House, for which I was forced to enquire, one of the Servants opening the Door, I bent
            down to go in (like a Goose under a Gate) for fear of striking my Head. My Wife ran out to embrace me, but I
            stooped lower than her Knees, thinking she could otherwise never be able to reach my Mouth. My Daughter
            kneeled to ask my Blessing, but I could not see her till she arose; having been so long used to stand with
            my Head and Eyes erect to above Sixty Foot; and then I went to take her up with one Hand, by the Waist. I
            looked down upon the Servants, and one or two Friends who were in the House, as if they had been Pigmies,
            and I a Giant. I told my wife, she had been too thrifty, for I found she had starved herself and her
            Daughter to nothing. In short, I behaved myself so unaccountably, that they were all of the Captain&rsquo;s
            Opinion when he first saw me; and concluded I had lost my Wits. This I mention as an Instance of the great
            Power of Habit and Prejudice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a little Time I and my Family and Friends came to a right Understanding: But my Wife protested I should
            never go to Sea any more; although my evil Destiny so ordered, that she had not Power to hinder me; as the
            Reader may know hereafter. In the mean Time, I here conclude the second Part of my unfortunate Voyages.</p>

                Arrival at an Island. He is received into</em> Laputa.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I h a d not been at home above ten Days, when Captain <em>William Robinson</em>, a <em>Cornish</em> Man,
            Commander of the <em>Hopewell</em>,* a stout Ship of three Hundred Tuns, came to my House. I had formerly
            been Surgeon of another Ship where he was Master, and a fourth Part Owner, in a Voyage to the
            <em>Levant</em>. He had always treated me more like a Brother than an inferior Oﬃcer; and hearing of my
            Arrival made me a Visit, as I apprehended only out of Friendship, for nothing passed more than what is usual
            after long Absence. But repeating his Visits often, expressing his Joy to find me in good Health, asking
            whether I were now settled for Life, adding that he intended a Voyage to the <em>East-Indies</em>, in two
            Months, at last he plainly invited me, although with some Apologies, to be Surgeon of the Ship. That I
            should have another Surgeon under me besides our two Mates; that my Sallary should be double to the usual
            Pay; and that having experienced my Knowledge in Sea-Aﬀairs to be at least equal to his, he would enter into
            any Engagement to follow my Advice, as much as if I had Share in the Command.</p>
        <p>He said so many other obliging things, and I knew him to be so honest a Man, that I could not reject his
            Proposal; the Thirst I had of seeing the World,* notwithstanding my past Misfortunes, con-tinuing as violent
            as ever. The only Diﬃculty that remained, was to persuade my Wife, whose Consent however I at last obtained,
            by the Prospect of Advantage she proposed* to her Children.</p>
        <p>We set out the 5th Day of <em>August</em>, 1706, and arrived at Fort St <em>George</em>,* the 11th of
            <em>April</em> 1707. We stayed there three Weeks to refresh our Crew, many of whom were sick. From thence we
            went to <em>Tonquin</em>, where the Captain resolved to continue some time; because many of the Goods he
            intended to buy were not ready, nor could he expect to be dispatched in several Months. Therefore in hopes
            to defray some of the Charges he must be at, he bought a Sloop, loaded it with several Sorts of Goods,
            wherewith the <em>Tonquinese</em> usually trade to the neighbouring Islands; and putting Fourteen Men on</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>142&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Board, whereof three were of the Country, he appointed me Master of the Sloop, and gave me Power to traﬃck,
            while he transacted his aﬀairs at <em>Tonquin</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We had not sailed above three Days, when a great Storm arising, we were driven five Days to the
            North-North-East, and then to the East; after which we had fair Weather, but still with a pretty strong Gale
            from the West. Upon the tenth Day we were chased by two Pyrates, who soon overtook us; for my Sloop was so
            deep loaden, that she sailed very slow; neither were we in a Condition to defend our selves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We were boarded about the same Time by both the Pyrates, who entered furiously at the Head of their Men; but
            finding us all pros-trate upon our Faces, (for so I gave Order,) they pinioned us with strong Ropes, and
            setting a Guard upon us, went to search the Sloop.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I observed among them a <em>Dutchman</em>, who seemed to be of some Authority, although he were not Commander
            of either Ship. He knew us by our Countenances to be <em>Englishmen</em>, and jabbering to us in his own
            Language, swore we should be tyed Back to Back,* and thrown into the Sea. I spoke <em>Dutch</em> tolerably
            well; I told him who we were, and begged him in Consideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of
            neighbouring Countries, in strict Alliance,* that he would move the Captains to take some pity on us. This
            inflamed his Rage; he repeated his Threatnings, and turning to his Companions, spoke with great Vehemence,
            in the <em>Japanese</em> Language, as I suppose; often using the Word <em>Christianos</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The largest of the two Pyrate Ships was commanded by a <em>Japanese</em> Captain, who spoke a little
            <em>Dutch</em>, but very imperfectly. He came up to me, and after several Questions, which I answered in
            great Humility, he said we should not die. I made the Captain a very low Bow, and then turning to the
            <em>Dutchman</em>, said, I was sorry to find more Mercy in a Heathen, than in a Brother Christian. But I had
            soon Reason to repent those foolish Words; for that malicious Reprobate, having often endeavoured in vain to
            persuade both the Captains that I might be thrown into the Sea, (which they would not yield to after the
            Promise made me, that I should not die) however prevailed so far as to have a Punishment inflicted on me,
            worse in all human Appearance than Death it self. My Men were sent by an equal Division into both the
            Pyrate-Ships, and my Sloop new</p>

        <p>manned. As to my self, it was determined that I should be set a-drift, in a small Canoe, with Paddles and a
            Sail, and four Days Provisions; which last the <em>Japanese</em> Captain was so kind to double out of his
            own Stores, and would permit no Man to search me. I got down into the Canoe, while the <em>Dutchman</em>
            standing upon the Deck, loaded me with all the Curses and injurious Terms his Language could aﬀord.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About an Hour before we saw the Pyrates, I had taken an Observation, and found we were in the Latitude of 46
            N. and of Longitude 183.* When I was at some Distance from the Pyrates, I discovered by my Pocket-Glass
            several Islands to the South-East. I set up my Sail, the Wind being fair, with a Design to reach the nearest
            of those Islands, which I made a Shift to do in about three Hours. It was all rocky; however I got many
            Birds Eggs; and striking Fire, I kindled some Heath and dry Sea Weed, by which I roasted my Eggs. I eat no
            other Supper, being resolved to spare my Provisions as much as I could. I passed the Night under the Shelter
            of a Rock, strowing some Heath under me, and slept pretty well.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next Day I sailed to another Island, and thence to a third and fourth, sometimes using my Sail, and
            sometimes my Paddles. But not to trouble the Reader with a particular Account of my Distresses; let it
            suﬃce, that on the 5th Day, I arrived at the last Island in my Sight, which lay South-South-East to the
            former.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This island was at a greater Distance than I expected, and I did not reach it in less than five Hours. I
            encompassed it almost round before I could find a convenient Place to land in, which was a small Creek,
            about three Times the Wideness of my Canoe. I found the Island to be all rocky, only a little intermingled
            with Tufts of Grass, and sweet smelling Herbs. I took out my small Provisions, and after having refreshed
            myself, I secured the Remainder in a Cave, whereof there were great Numbers. I gathered Plenty of Eggs upon
            the Rocks, and got a Quantity of dry Seaweed, and parched Grass, which I designed to kindle the next Day,
            and roast my Eggs as well as I could. (For I had about me my Flint, Steel, Match, and Burning-glass.) I lay
            all Night in the Cave where I had lodged my Provisions. My Bed was the same dry Grass and Sea-weed which I
            intended for Fewel. I slept very little; for the Disquiets of my Mind prevailed over my Wearyness, and kept
            me awake. I considered how impossible it was to preserve my Life, in so desolate a Place, and how miserable
            my End must be. Yet I found my self so listless and desponding, that</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had not the Heart to rise; and before I could get Spirits enough to creep out of my Cave, the Day was far
            advanced. I walked a while among the Rocks, the Sky was perfectly clear, and the Sun so hot, that I was
            forced to turn my Face from it: When all on a Sudden it became obscured, as I thought, in a Manner very
            diﬀerent from what happens by the Interposition of a Cloud. I turned back, and perceived a vast Opake Body*
            between me and the Sun, moving for-wards towards the Island: It seemed to be about two Miles high, and hid
            the Sun six or seven Minutes, but I did not observe the Air to be much colder, or the Sky more darkened,
            than if I had stood under the Shade of a Mountain. As it approached nearer over the Place where I was, it
            appeared to be a firm Substance, the Bottom flat, smooth, and shining very bright* from the Reflexion of the
            Sea below. I stood upon a Height about two Hundred Yards from the Shoar, and saw this vast Body descending
            almost to a Parallel with me, at less than an <em>English</em> Mile Distance. I took out my
            Pocket-Perspective, and could plainly discover Numbers of People moving up and down the Sides of it, which
            appeared to be sloping, but what those People were doing, I was not able to distinguish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The natural Love of Life gave me some inward Motions of Joy; and I was ready to entertain a Hope, that this
            Adventure might some Way or other help to deliver me from the desolate Place and Condition I was in. But, at
            the same Time, the Reader can hardly conceive my Astonishment, to behold an Island in the Air, inhabited by
            Men, who were able (as it should seem) to raise, or sink, or put it into a progres-sive Motion, as they
            pleased.* But not being, at that Time, in a Disposition to philosophise upon this Ph&aelig;nomenon, I rather
            chose to observe what Course the Island would take; because it seemed for a while to stand still. Yet soon
            after it advanced nearer, and I could see the Sides of it, encompassed with several Gradations of Galleries
            and Stairs, at certain Intervals, to descend from one to the other. In the lowest Gallery, I beheld some
            People fishing with long Angling Rods, and others looking on. I waved my Cap (for my Hat was long since worn
            out,) and my Handkerchief towards the Island; and upon its nearer Approach, I called and shouted with the
            utmost Strength of my Voice; and then looking circumspectly, I beheld a Crowd gathered to that Side which
            was most in my View. I found by their pointing towards me and to each other, that they plainly discovered
            me, although they made no Return to my Shouting: But I could see</p>

        <p>four or five Men running in great Haste up the Stairs to the Top of the Island, who then disappeared. I
            happened rightly to conjecture, that these were sent for Orders to some Person in Authority upon this
            Occasion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Number of People increased; and in less than Half an Hour, the Island was moved and raised in such a
            Manner, that the lowest Gallery appeared in a Parallel of less than an Hundred Yards Distance from the
            Height where I stood. I then put my self into the most supplicating Postures, and spoke in the humblest
            Accent, but received no Answer. Those who stood nearest over-against me, seemed to be Persons of
            Distinction, as I supposed by their Habit. They conferred earnestly with each other, looking often upon me.
            At length one of them called out in a clear, polite,* smooth Dialect, not unlike in Sound to the
            <em>Italian</em>;* and therefore I returned an Answer in that Language, hoping at least that the Cadence
            might be more agreeable to his Ears. Although neither of us understood the other, yet my Meaning was easily
            known, for the People saw the Distress I was in.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They made Signs for me to come down from the Rock, and go towards the Shoar, which I accordingly did; and the
            flying Island being raised to a convenient Height, the Verge directly over me, a Chain was let down from the
            lowest Gallery, with a Seat fastned to the Bottom, to which I fixed my self, and was drawn up by Pullies.

                Disquietudes. An Account of the Women.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A t my alighting I was surrounded by a Crowd of People, but those who stood nearest seemed to be of better
            Quality. They beheld me with all the Marks and Circumstances of Wonder; neither indeed was I much in their
            Debt,* having never till then seen a Race of Mortals so singular* in their Shapes, Habits, and Countenances.
            Their Heads were all reclined either to the Right or the Left; one of their Eyes turned inward, and the
            other directly up to the Zenith. Their outward Garments were adorned with the Figures of Suns, Moons, and
            Stars, interwoven with those of Fiddles, Flutes, Harps, Trumpets, Guittars, Harpsichords, and many more
            Instruments of Musick, unknown to us in <em>Europe</em>. I observed here and there many in the Habit of
            Servants, with a blown Bladder fastned like a Flail to the End of a short Stick, which they carried in their
            Hands. In each Bladder was a small Quantity of dried Pease, or little Pebbles (as I was afterwards
            informed). With these Bladders they now and then flapped the Mouths and Ears of those who stood near them,
            of which Practice I could not then conceive the Meaning. It seems, the Minds of these People are so taken up
            with intense Speculations, that they neither can speak, nor attend to the Discourses of others, without
            being roused by some external Taction* upon the Organs of Speech and Hearing; for which Reason, those
            Persons who are able to aﬀord it, always keep a <em>Flapper</em>, (the Original is <em>Climenole</em>) in
            their Family, as one of their Domesticks; nor ever walk abroad or make Visits without him. And the Business
            of this Oﬃcer is, when two or more Persons are in Company, gently to strike with his Bladder the Mouth of
            him who is to speak, and the Right Ear of him or them to whom the Speaker addresseth himself. This
            <em>Flapper</em> is likewise employed diligently to attend his Master in his Walks, and upon Occasion to
            give him a soft Flap on his Eyes; because he is always so wrapped up* in Cogitation, that he is in manifest
            Danger of falling down every Precipice, and bouncing his Head against every Post; and in</p>

        <p>the Streets, of jostling others, or being jostled himself into the Kennel.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was necessary to give the Reader this Information, without which he would be at the same Loss with me, to
            understand the Proceedings of these People, as they conducted me up the Stairs, to the Top of the Island,
            and from thence to the Royal Palace. While we were ascending, they forgot several Times what they were
            about, and left me to my self, till their Memories were again rouzed by their <em>Flappers</em>; for they
            appeared altogether unmoved by the Sight of my foreign Habit and Countenance, and by the Shouts of the
            Vulgar, whose Thoughts and Minds were more disengaged.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At last we entered the Palace, and proceeded into the Chamber of Presence; where I saw the King seated on his
            Throne, attended on each Side by Persons of prime Quality. Before the Throne, was a large Table filled with
            Globes and Spheres, and Mathematical Instruments* of all Kinds. His Majesty took not the least Notice of us,
            although our Entrance were not without suﬃcient Noise, by the Concourse of all Persons belonging to the
            Court. But, he was then deep in a Problem, and we attended at least an Hour, before he could solve it. There
            stood by him on each Side, a young Page, with Flaps in their Hands; and when they saw he was at Leisure, one
            of them gently struck his Mouth, and the other his Right Ear; at which he started like one awakened on the
            sudden, and looking towards me, and the Company I was in, recollected the Occasion of our coming, whereof he
            had been informed before. He spoke some Words; whereupon immediately a young Man with a Flap came up to my
            Side, and flapt me gently on the Right Ear; but I made Signs as well as I could, that I had no Occasion for
            such an Instrument; which as I afterwards found, gave his Majesty and the whole Court a very mean Opinion of
            my Understanding. The King, as far as I could con-jecture, asked me several Questions, and I addressed my
            self to him in all the Languages I had. When it was found, that I could neither understand nor be
            understood, I was conducted by his Order to an Apartment in his Palace, (this Prince being distinguished
            above all his Predecessors for his Hospitality to Strangers,*) where two Servants were appointed to attend
            me. My Dinner was brought, and four Persons of Quality, whom I remembered to have seen very near the
            King&rsquo;s Person, did me the Honour to dine with me. We had two Courses, of three Dishes each. In the
            first Course, there was a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>148&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>Shoulder of Mutton, cut into an &AElig;quilateral Triangle; a Piece of Beef into a Rhomboides; and a Pudding
            into a Cycloid. The second Course was two Ducks, trussed up into the Form of Fiddles; Sausages and Puddings
            resembling Flutes and Haut-boys, and a Breast of Veal in the Shape of a Harp. The Servants cut our Bread
            into Cones, Cylinders, Parallelograms, and several other Mathematical Figures.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While we were at Dinner, I made bold to ask the Names of several Things in their Language; and those noble
            Persons, by the Assist-ance of their <em>Flappers</em>, delighted to give me Answers, hoping to raise my
            Admiration of their great Abilities, if I could be brought to converse with them. I was soon able to call
            for Bread, and Drink, or whatever else I wanted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After Dinner my Company withdrew, and a Person was sent to me by the King&rsquo;s Order, attended by a
            <em>Flapper</em>. He brought with him Pen, Ink, and Paper, and three or four Books; giving me to understand
            by Signs, that he was sent to teach me the Language. We sat together four Hours, in which Time I wrote down
            a great Number of Words in Columns, with the Translations over against them. I likewise made a Shift to
            learn several short Sentences. For my Tutor would order one of my Servants to fetch something, to turn
            about, to make a Bow, to sit, or stand, or walk, and the like. Then I took down the Sentence in Writing. He
            shewed me also in one of his Books, the Figures of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Zodiack, the Tropics, and
            Polar Circles, together with the Denominations of many Figures of Planes and Solids. He gave me the Names
            and Descriptions of all the Musical Instruments, and the general Terms of Art in playing on each of them.
            After he had left me, I placed all my Words with their Interpret-ations in alphabetical Order. And thus in a
            few Days, by the Help of a very faithful Memory, I got some Insight into their Language.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Word, which I interpret the <em>Flying</em> or <em>Floating Island</em>,* is in the Original
            <em>Laputa</em>, whereof I could never learn the true Etymology.* <em>Lap</em> in the old obsolete Language
            signifies <em>High</em>, and <em>Untuh</em>, a <em>Governor</em>, from which they say by Corruption was
            derived<em> Laputa</em> from <em>Lapuntuh</em>. But I do not approve of this Derivation, which seems to be a
            little strained. I ventured to oﬀer to the Learned among them a Conjecture of my own, that <em>Laputa</em>
            was <em>quasi Lap outed</em>; <em>Lap</em> signifying properly the dancing of the Sun Beams in the Sea; and
            <em>outed</em> a Wing, which however I shall not obtrude, but submit to the judicious Reader.</p>

        <p>Those to whom the King had entrusted me, observing how ill I was clad, ordered a Taylor to come next Morning,
            and take my Measure for a Suit of Cloths. This Operator did his Oﬃce after a diﬀerent Manner from those of
            his Trade in <em>Europe</em>. He first took my Altitude by a Quadrant, and then with a Rule and Compasses,
            described the Dimensions and Out-Lines of my whole Body; all which he entered upon Paper, and in six Days
            brought my Cloths very ill made, and quite out of Shape, by happening to mistake a Figure* in the
            Calculation. But my Comfort was, that I observed such Accidents very frequent, and little regarded.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During my Confinement for want of Cloaths, and by an Indisposition that held me some Days longer, I much
            enlarged my Dictionary; and when I went next to Court, was able to understand many Things the King spoke,
            and to return him some Kind of Answers. His Majesty had given Orders, that the Island should move North-East
            and by East, to the vertical Point over <em>Lagado</em>, the Metropolis of the whole Kingdom, below upon the
            firm Earth. It was about Ninety Leagues distant, and our Voyage lasted four Days and an Half. I was not in
            the least sensible of the progressive Motion made in the Air by the Island. On the second Morning, about
            Eleven o&rsquo;Clock, the King himself in Person, attended by his Nobility, Courtiers, and Oﬃcers, having
            prepared all their Musical Instru-ments,* played on them for three Hours without Intermission; so that I was
            quite stunned with the Noise; neither could I possibly guess the Meaning, till my Tutor informed me. He
            said, that the People of their Island had their Ears adapted to hear the Musick of the Spheres,* which
            always played at certain Periods; and the Court was now prepared to bear their Part in whatever Instrument
            they most Excelled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In our Journey towards <em>Lagado</em>, the Capital City, his Majesty ordered that the Island should stop
            over certain Towns and Villages, from whence he might receive the Petitions of his Subjects. And to this
            Purpose, several Packthreads were let down* with small Weights at the Bottom. On these Packthreads the
            People strung their Petitions, which mounted up directly like the Scraps of Paper fastned by School-boys at
            the End of the String that holds their Kite. Some-times we received Wine and Victuals from below, which were
            drawn up by Pullies.</p>

        <p>The Knowledge I had in Mathematicks gave me great Assistance</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>in acquiring their Phraseology, which depended much upon that Science and Musick; and in the latter I was not
            unskilled. Their Ideas are perpetually conversant in Lines and Figures. If they would, for Example, praise
            the Beauty of a Woman, or any other Animal, they describe it by Rhombs, Circles, Parallelograms, Ellipses,
            and other Geometrical Terms; or else by Words of Art drawn from Musick, needless here to repeat. I observed
            in the King&rsquo;s Kitchen all Sorts of Mathematical and Musical Instruments, after the Figures of which
            they cut up the Joynts that were served to his Majesty&rsquo;s Table.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their Houses are very ill built, the Walls bevil without one right Angle in any Apartment; and this Defect
            ariseth from the Contempt they bear to practical Geometry; which they despise as vulgar and mechanick, those
            Instructions they give being too refined for the Intellectuals* of their Workmen; which occasions perpetual
            Mistakes. And although they are dexterous enough upon a Piece of Paper in the Management of the Rule, the
            Pencil, and the Divider, yet in the common Actions and Behaviour of Life, I have not seen a more clumsy,
            awkward, and unhandy People, nor so slow and perplexed in their Conceptions upon all other Subjects, except
            those of Mathematicks and Musick. They are very bad Reasoners, and vehemently given to Opposition, unless
            when they happen to be of the right Opinion, which is seldom their Case. Imagination, Fancy, and Invention,
            they are wholly Strangers to, nor have any Words in their Language by which those Ideas can be expressed;
            the whole Compass of their Thoughts and Mind, being shut up within the two forementioned Sciences.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Most of them, and especially those who deal in the Astronomical Part, have great Faith in judicial
            Astrology,* although they are ashamed to own it publickly. But, what I chiefly admired, and thought
            altogether unaccountable, was the strong Disposition I observed in them towards News and Politicks,*
            perpetually enquiring into publick Aﬀairs, giving their Judgments in Matters of State; and passionately
            disputing every Inch of a Party Opinion. I have indeed observed the same Disposition among most of the
            Mathematicians* I have known in <em>Europe</em>; although I could never discover the least Analogy between
            the two Sciences; unless those People suppose, that because the smallest Circle hath as many Degrees as the
            largest, therefore the Regulation and Management of the World require no more Abilities than the handling
            and turning of a Globe. But, I</p>

        <p>rather take this Quality to spring from a very common Infirmity of human Nature, inclining us to be more
            curious and conceited* in Matters where we have least Concern, and for which we are least adapted either by
            Study or Nature.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These People are under continual Disquietudes, never enjoying a Minute&rsquo;s Peace of Mind; and their
            Disturbances proceed from Causes which very little aﬀect the rest of Mortals. Their Apprehen-sions arise
            from several Changes they dread in the Celestial Bodies. For Instance; that the Earth by the continual
            Approaches of the Sun towards it, must in Course of Time be absorbed or swallowed up.* That the Face of the
            Sun will by Degrees be encrusted with its own Eﬄuvia,* and give no more Light to the World. That, the Earth
            very narrowly escaped a Brush from the Tail of the last Comet,* which would have infallibly reduced it to
            Ashes; and that the next, which they have calculated for One and Thirty years hence, will probably destroy
            us.* For, if in its Perihelion* it should approach within a certain Degree of the Sun, (as by their
            Calculations they have Reason to dread) it will conceive a Degree of Heat ten Thousand Times more intense
            than that of red hot glowing Iron; and in its Absence from the Sun, carry a blazing Tail Ten Hundred
            Thousand and Fourteen Miles long; through which if the Earth should pass at the distance of one Hundred
            Thousand Miles from the <em>Nucleus</em>, or main Body of the Comet, it must in its Passage be set on Fire,
            and reduced to Ashes. That the Sun daily spending its Rays without any Nutriment to supply them, will at
            last be wholly consumed and annihilated;* which must be attended with the Destruction of this Earth, and of

        <p>They are so perpetually alarmed with the Apprehensions of these and the like impending Dangers, that they can
            neither sleep quietly in their Beds, nor have any Relish for the common Pleasures or Amusements of Life.
            When they meet an Acquaintance in the Morning, the first Question is about the Sun&rsquo;s Health; how he
            looked at his Setting and Rising, and what Hopes they have to avoid the Stroak of the approaching Comet.
            This Conversation they are apt to run into with the same Temper that Boys discover, in delight-ing to hear
            terrible Stories of Sprites and Hobgoblins, which they greedily listen to, and dare not go to Bed for fear.

            from the Continent below, attending at Court, either upon Aﬀairs of the several Towns and Corporations, or
            their own particular Occasions; but are much despised, because they want the same Endowments.* Among these
            the Ladies chuse their Gallants: But the Vexation is, that they act with too much Ease and Security; for the
            Husband is always so rapt in Speculation, that the Mistress and Lover may proceed to the greatest
            Familiarities before his Face, if he be but provided with Paper and Implements,* and without his

        <p>The Wives and Daughters lament their Confinement to the Island, although I think it the most delicious Spot
            of Ground in the World; and although they live here in the greatest Plenty and Magnificence, and are allowed
            to do whatever they please: They long to see the World, and take the Diversions of the Metropolis, which
            they are not allowed to do without a particular Licence from the King; and this is not easy to be obtained,
            because the People of Quality have found by frequent Experience, how hard it is to persuade their Women to
            return from below. I was told, that a great Court Lady, who had several Children, is married to the prime
            Minister,* the richest Subject in the Kingdom, a very graceful Person, extremely fond of her, and lives in
            the finest Palace of the Island; went down to <em>Lagado</em>, on the Pretence of Health, there hid her self
            for several Months, till the King sent a Warrant to search for her; and she was found in an obscure
            Eating-House all in Rags, having pawned her Cloths to maintain an old deformed Footman, who beat her every
            Day, and in whose Company she was taken much against her Will. And although her Husband received her with
            all possible Kindness, and without the least Reproach; she soon after contrived to steal down again with all
            her Jewels, to the same Gallant, and hath not been heard of since.</p>

                to grant, and ordered my Tutor to attend me. I chiefly wanted to know to what Cause in Art or in Nature,
                it owed its several Motions; whereof I will now give a philosophical Account to the Reader.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The flying or floating Island is exactly circular; its Diameter* 7837 Yards, or about four Miles and a Half,
            and consequently contains ten Thousand Acres. It is three Hundred Yards thick. The Bottom, or under Surface,
            which appears to those who view it from below, is one even regular Plate of Adamant, shooting up to the
            Height of about two Hundred Yards. Above it lye the several Minerals in their usual Order; and over all is a
            Coat of rich Mould ten or twelve Foot deep. The Declivity of the upper Surface, from the Circumference to
            the Center, is the natural Cause why all the Dews and Rains which fall upon the Island, are conveyed in
            small Rivulets toward the Middle, where they are emptyed into four large Basons, each of about Half a Mile
            in Circuit, and two Hundred Yards distant from the Center. From these Basons the Water is continually
            exhaled by the Sun in the Day-time, which eﬀectually prevents their overflowing. Besides, as it is in the
            Power of the Monarch to raise the Island above the Region of Clouds and Vapours, he can prevent the falling
            of Dews and Rains whenever he pleases. For the highest Clouds cannot rise above two Miles, as Naturalists
            agree,* at least they were never known to do so in that Country.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At the Center of the Island there is a Chasm about fifty Yards in Diameter, from whence the Astronomers
            descend into a large Dome, which is therefore called <em>Flandona Gagnole</em>, or the <em>Astronomers
                Cave</em>;* situated at the Depth of an Hundred Yards beneath the upper Surface of the Adamant. In this
            Cave are Twenty Lamps continually burning, which from the Reflection of the Adamant cast a strong Light into
            every Part. The Place is stored with great Variety of</p>

        <p>Sextants, Quadrants, Telescopes, Astrolabes, and other Astronomical Instruments. But the greatest Curiosity,
            upon which the Fate of the Island depends, is a Load-stone* of a prodigious Size, in Shape resembling a
            Weaver&rsquo;s Shuttle.* It is in Length six Yards, and in the thickest Part at least three Yards over. This
            Magnet is sustained by a very strong Axle of Adamant, passing through its Middle, upon which it plays, and
            is poized so exactly that the weakest Hand can turn it. It is hooped round with a hollow Cylinder of
            Adamant, four Foot deep, as many thick, and twelve Yards in Diameter, placed horizontally, and supported by
            Eight Adamantine feet, each Six Yards high. In the Middle of the Concave Side there is a Groove Twelve
            Inches deep, in which the Extremities of the Axle are lodged, and turned round as there is Occasion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Stone cannot be moved from its Place by any Force, because the Hoop and its Feet are one continued Piece
            with that Body of Adamant which constitutes the Bottom of the Island.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By Means of this Load-stone, the Island is made to rise and fall, and move from one Place to another. For,
            with respect to that Part of the Earth over which the Monarch presides, the Stone is endued at one of its
            Sides with an attractive Power, and at the other with a repulsive. Upon placing the Magnet erect with its
            attracting End towards the Earth, the Island descends; but when the repelling Extremity points downwards,
            the Island mounts directly upwards. When the Position of the Stone is oblique, the Motion of the Island is
            so too. For in this Magnet the Forces always act in Lines parallel to its Direction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By this oblique Motion the Island is conveyed to diﬀerent Parts of the Monarch&rsquo;s Dominions. To explain
            the Manner of its Progress, let <em>A B</em> represent a Line drawn cross the Dominions of
            <em>Balnibarbi</em>; let the Line <em>c d</em> represent the Load-stone, of which let <em>d</em> be the
            repelling End, and <em>c</em> the attracting End, the Island being over <em>C</em>; let the Stone be placed
            in the Position <em>c d</em>, with its repelling End down-wards; then the Island will be driven upwards
            obliquely towards <em>D</em>. When it is arrived at <em>D</em>, let the Stone be turned upon its Axle, till
            its attracting End points towards <em>E</em>, and then the Island will be carried obliquely towards
            <em>E</em>; where if the Stone be again turned upon its Axle till it stands in the Position <em>E F</em>,
            with its repelling Point down-wards, the Island will rise obliquely towards <em>F</em>, where by directing
            the attracting End towards <em>G</em>, the Island may be carried to <em>G</em>, and</p>

        <p>from <em>G</em> to <em>H</em>, by turning the Stone, so as to make its repelling Extremity point directly
            downwards. And thus by changing the Situation of the Stone as often as there is Occasion, the Island is made
            to rise and fall by Turns in an oblique Direction; and by those alternate Risings and Fallings (the
            Obliquity being not Considerable) is conveyed from one Part of the Dominions to the other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But it must be observed, that this Island cannot move beyond the Extent of the Dominions below; nor can it
            rise above the Height of four Miles. For which the Astronomers (who have written large Systems concerning
            the Stone) assign the following Reason: That the Magnetick Virtue does not extend beyond the Distance of
            four Miles, and that the Mineral which acts upon the Stone in the Bowels of the Earth, and in the Sea about
            six Leagues distant from the Shoar, is not diﬀused through the whole Globe, but terminated with the Limits
            of the King&rsquo;s Dominions: And it was easy from the great Advantage of such a superior Situation, for a
            Prince to bring under his Obedience whatever Country lay within the Attraction of that Magnet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the Stone is put parallel to the Plane of the Horizon, the Island standeth still; for in that Case, the
            Extremities of it being at equal Distance from the Earth, act with equal Force, the one in drawing
            downwards, the other in pushing upwards; and consequently no Motion can ensue.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Load-stone is under the Care of certain Astronomers, who from Time to Time give it such Positions as the
            Monarch directs. They spend the greatest Part of their Lives in observing the celestial Bodies, which they
            do by the Assistance of Glasses, far excelling ours in Goodness. For, although their largest Telescopes do
            not exceed three Feet, they magnify much more than those of a Hundred with us, and shew the Stars with
            greater Clearness.* This Advantage hath enabled them to extend their Discoveries much far-ther than our
            Astronomers in <em>Europe</em>. They have made a Catalogue of ten Thousand fixed Stars,* whereas the largest
            of ours do not contain above one third Part of that Number. They have likewise discovered two lesser Stars,
            or <em>Satellites</em>,* which revolve about <em>Mars</em>; whereof the innermost is distant from the Center
            of the primary Planet exactly three of his Diameters, and the outermost five; the former revolves in the
            Space of ten Hours, and the latter in</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>158&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>Twenty-one and a Half; so that the Squares of their periodical Times, are very near in the same Proportion
            with the Cubes of their Distance from the Center of <em>Mars</em>; which evidently shews them to be governed
            by the same Law of Gravitation, that influences the other heavenly Bodies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They have observed Ninety-three diﬀerent Comets,* and settled their Periods with great Exactness. If this be
            true, (and they aﬃrm it with great Confidence) it is much to be wished that their Observations were made
            publick; whereby the Theory of Comets, which at present is very lame and defective, might be brought to the
            same Perfection with other Parts of Astronomy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The King would be the most absolute Prince in the Universe, if he could but prevail on a Ministry to join
            with him; but these having their Estates* below on the Continent, and considering that the Oﬃce of a
            Favourite hath a very uncertain Tenure, would never consent to the enslaving their Country.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If any Town should engage in Rebellion or Mutiny, fall into violent Factions, or refuse to pay the usual
            Tribute; the King hath two Methods of reducing them to Obedience. The first and the mildest Course by
            keeping the Island hovering over such a Town, and the lands about it; whereby he can deprive them of the
            Benefit of the Sun* and the Rain, and consequently aﬄict the Inhabitants with Dearth and Diseases. And if
            the Crime deserve it, they are at the same time pelted from above with great Stones, against which they have
            no Defence, but by creeping into Cellars or Caves, while the Roofs of their Houses are beaten to Pieces. But
            if they still continue obstinate, or oﬀer to raise Insurrections; he proceeds to the last Remedy, by letting
            the Island drop directly upon their Heads, which makes a universal Destruction both of Houses and Men.
            However, this is an Extremity to which the Prince is seldom driven, neither indeed is he willing, to put it
            in Execution; nor dare his Ministers advise him to an Action, which as it would render them odious to the
            People, so it would be a great Damage to their own Estates that lie all below; for the Island is the
            King&rsquo;s Demesn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But there is still indeed a more weighty Reason, why the Kings of this Country have been always averse from
            executing so terrible an Action, unless upon the utmost Necessity. For if the Town intended to be destroyed
            should have in it any tall Rocks, as it generally falls out in the larger Cities; a Situation probably
            chosen at first with a</p>

        <p>View to prevent such a Catastrophe: Or if it abound in high Spires or Pillars of Stone, a sudden Fall might
            endanger the Bottom or under Surface of the Island, which although it consists as I have said, of one entire
            Adamant two hundred Yards thick, might happen to crack by too great a Choque, or burst by approaching too
            near the Fires from the Houses below; as the Backs both of Iron and Stone will often do in our Chimneys. Of
            all this the People are well apprized, and understand how far to carry their Obstinacy, where their Liberty
            or Property is concerned. And the King, when he is highest provoked, and most determined to press a City to
            Rubbish, orders the Island to descend with great Gentleness, out of a Pretence of Tenderness to his People,
            but indeed for fear of breaking the Adamantine Bottom; in which Case it is the Opinion of all their
            Philosophers, that the Load-stone could no longer hold it up, and the whole Mass would fall to the Ground.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>[About three years* before my Arrival among them, while the King was in his Progress over his Dominions,
            there happened an extra-ordinary Accident which had like to have put a Period to the Fate of that Monarchy,
            at least as it is now instituted. Lindalino* the second City in the Kingdom was the first his Majesty
            visited in his Progress. Three Days after his Departure, the Inhabitants who had often com-plained of great
            Oppressions, shut the Town Gates, seized on the Governor, and with incredible Speed and Labour erected four
            large Towers, one at every Corner of the City (which is an exact Square) equal in Heigth to a strong pointed
            Rock that stands directly in the Center of the City. Upon the Top of each Tower, as well as upon the Rock,
            they fixed a great Loadstone, and in case their Design should fail, they had provided a vast Quantity of the
            most combustible Fewel, hoping to burst therewith the adamantine Bottom of the Island, if the Loadstone
            Project should miscarry.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was eight Months before the King had perfect Notice that the Lindalinians were in Rebellion. He then
            commanded that the Island should be wafted over the City. The People were unanimous, and had laid in Store
            of Provisions, and a great River runs through the middle of the Town. The King hovered over them several
            Days to deprive them of the Sun and the Rain. He ordered many Pack-threads to be let down, yet not a Person
            oﬀered to send up a Petition, but instead thereof, very bold Demands, the Redress of all their Greivances,
            great Immunitys,* the Choice of their own Governor,*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and other the like Exorbitances. Upon which his Majesty commanded all the Inhabitants of the Island to cast
            great Stones from the lower Gallery into the Town; but the Citizens had provided against this Mischief by
            conveying their Persons and Eﬀects into the four Towers, and other strong Buildings, and Vaults under
            Ground.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The King being now determined to reduce this proud People, ordered that the Island should descend gently
            within fourty Yards of the Top of the Towers and Rock. This was accordingly done; but the Oﬃcers employed in
            that Work found the Descent much speedier than usual, and by turning the Loadstone could not without great
            Diﬃculty keep it in a firm Position, but found the Island inclining to fall. They sent the King immediate
            Intelligence of this astonishing Event, and begged his Majesty&rsquo;s Permission to raise the Island
            higher; the King consented, a general Council was called, and the Oﬃcers of the Loadstone ordered to attend.
            One of the oldest and expertest among them obtained Leave to try an Experiment. He took a strong Line of an
            hundred Yards, and the Island being raised over the Town above the attracting Power they had felt, He
            fastened a Piece of Adamant to the End of his Line which had in it a Mixture of Iron mineral, of the same
            Nature with that whereof the Bottom or lower Surface of the Island is composed, and from the lower Gallery
            let it down slowly towards the Top of the Towers. The Adamant was not descended four Yards, before the Oﬃcer
            felt it drawn so strongly downwards, that he could hardly pull it back. He then threw down several small
            Pieces of Adamant, and observed that they were all violently attracted by the Top of the Tower. The same
            Experiment was made on the other three Towers, and on the Rock with the same Eﬀect.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Incident broke entirely the King&rsquo;s Measures and (to dwell no longer on other Circumstances) he was
            forced to give the Town their own Conditions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was assured by a great Minister, that if the Island had descended so near the Town, as not to be able to
            raise it self, the Citizens were determined to fix it for ever, to kill the King and all his Servants, and
            entirely change the Government.]*</p>

        <p>By a fundamental Law of this Realm, neither the King nor either of his two elder Sons, are permitted to leave
            the Island; nor the Queen till she is past Child-bearing.*</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A lt h o u g h I cannot say that I was ill treated in this Island, yet I must confess I thought myself too
            much neglected, not without some Degree of Contempt. For neither Prince nor People appeared to be curious in
            any Part of Knowledge, except Mathematicks and Musick, wherein I was far their inferior, and upon that
            Account very little regarded.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the other Side, after having seen all the Curiosities of the Island, I was very desirous to leave it,
            being heartily weary of those People.* They were indeed excellent in two Sciences for which I have great
            Esteem, and wherein I am not unversed; but at the same time so abstracted and involved in Speculation, that
            I never met with such disagreeable Companions. I conversed only with Women, Tradesmen, <em>Flappers</em>,
            and Court-Pages, during two Months of my Abode there; by which at last I rendered myself extremely
            contempt-ible; yet these were the only People from whom I could ever receive a reasonable Answer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had obtained by hard Study a good Degree of Knowledge in their Language: I was weary of being confined to
            an Island where I received so little Countenance;* and resolved to leave it with the first Opportunity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a great Lord at Court, nearly related to the King, and for that Reason alone used with respect. He
            was universally reck-oned the most ignorant and stupid Person among them. He had performed many eminent
            Services for the Crown, had great natural and acquired Parts, adorned with Integrity and Honour; but so ill
            an Ear for Musick, that his Detractors reported he had been often known to beat Time in the wrong Place;
            neither could his Tutors without extreme Diﬃculty teach him to demonstrate the most easy Proposition in the
            Mathematicks. He was pleased to shew me many Marks of Favour, often did me the Honour of a Visit, desired to
            be informed in the Aﬀairs of <em>Europe</em>, the Laws and Customs, the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>162&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Manners and Learning of the several Countries where I had trav-elled. He listened to me with great Attention,
            and made very wise Observations on all I spoke. He had two <em>Flappers</em> attending him for State, but
            never made use of them except at Court, and in Visits of Ceremony, and would always command them to withdraw
            when we were alone together.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I intreated this illustrious Person to intercede in my Behalf with his Majesty for Leave to depart; which he
            accordingly did, as he was pleased to tell me, with Regret: For, indeed he had made me several Oﬀers very
            advantageous, which however I refused with Expressions of the highest Acknowledgment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the 16th Day of <em>February</em>, I took Leave of his Majesty and the Court. The King made me a Present
            to the Value of about two Hundred Pounds <em>English</em>; and my Protector his Kinsman as much more,
            together with a Letter of Recommendation to a friend of his in <em>Lagado</em>, the Metropolis. The Island
            being then hovering over a Mountain about two Miles from it, I was let down from the lowest Gallery, in the
            same Manner as I had been taken up.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Continent, as far as it is subject to the Monarch of the <em>Flying Island</em>, passeth under the
            general Name of <em>Balnibarbi</em>; and the Metropolis, as I said before, is called <em>Lagado</em>. I felt
            some little Satisfaction in finding myself on firm Ground. I walked to the City without any Concern, being
            clad like one of the Natives, and suﬃciently instructed to converse with them. I soon found out the
            Person&rsquo;s House to whom I was recommended; presented my Letter from his Friend the Grandee in the
            Island, and was received with much Kindness. This great Lord, whose Name was <em>Munodi</em>,* ordered me an
            Apartment in his own House, where I continued during my Stay, and was entertained in a most hospitable
            Manner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next Morning after my Arrival, he took me in his Chariot to see the Town, which is about half the Bigness
            of <em>London</em>; but the Houses very strangely built, and most of them out of Repair. The People in the
            Streets walked fast, looked wild, their Eyes fixed, and were generally in Rags. We passed through one of the
            Town Gates, and went about three Miles into the Country, where I saw many Labourers working with several
            Sorts of Tools in the Ground, but was not able to conjecture what they were about; neither did I observe any
            Expectation either of Corn or Grass, although the Soil appeared to be excellent. I could not forbear
            admiring at these odd</p>

        <p>Appearances both in Town and Country; and I made bold to desire my Conductor, that he would be pleased to
            explain to me what could be meant by so many busy Heads, Hands and Faces, both in the Streets and the
            Fields, because I did not discover any good Eﬀects they produced; but on the contrary, I never knew a Soil
            so unhappily cultivated, Houses so ill contrived and so ruinous, or a People whose Countenances and Habit
            expressed so much Misery and Want.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Lord <em>Munodi</em> was a Person of the first Rank, and had been some Years Governor of
            <em>Lagado</em>; but by a Cabal of Ministers was discharged for Insuﬃciency.* However the King treated him
            with Tenderness, as a well-meaning Man, but of a low contemptible Understanding.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I gave that free Censure of the Country and its Inhabitants, he made no further Answer than by telling
            me, that I had not been long enough among them to form a Judgment; and that the diﬀerent Nations of the
            World had diﬀerent Customs; with other common Topicks to the same Purpose. But when we returned to his
            Palace, he asked me how I liked the Building, what Absurdities I observed, and what Quarrel I had with the
            Dress or Looks of his Domesticks. This he might safely do; because every Thing about him was magnificent,
            regular, and polite.* I answered that his Excellency&rsquo;s Prudence, Quality, and Fortune, had exempted
            him from those Defects which Folly and Beggary had produced in others. He said if I would go with him to his
            Country House, about Twenty Miles distant, where his Estate lay, there would be more Leisure for this Kind
            of Conver-sation. I told his Excellency, that I was entirely at his Disposal; and accordingly we set out
            next Morning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During our Journey, he made me observe the several Methods used by Farmers in managing their Lands; which to
            me were wholly unaccountable: For except in some very few Places I could not discover one Ear of Corn, or
            Blade of Grass. But, in three Hours travelling, the Scene was wholly altered; we came into a most beautiful
            Country; Farmers Houses at small Distances, neatly built, the Fields enclosed, containing Vineyards,
            Corngrounds and Meadows. Neither do I remember to have seen a more delightful Prospect. His Excellency
            observed my Countenance to clear up; he told me with a Sigh, that there his Estate began, and would
            con-tinue the same till we should come to his House. That his</p>

            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Countrymen ridiculed and despised him for managing his Aﬀairs no better, and for setting so ill an Example to
            the Kingdom; which however was followed by very few, such as were old, and wilful, and weak like himself.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We came at length to the House, which was indeed a noble Structure, built according to the best Rules of
            ancient Architecture. The Fountains, Gardens, Walks, Avenues, and Groves were all disposed with exact
            Judgment and Taste. I gave due Praises to every Thing I saw, whereof his Excellency took not the least
            Notice till after Supper; when, there being no third Companion, he told me with a very melancholy Air, that
            he doubted he must throw down his Houses in Town and Country, to rebuild them after the present Mode;
            destroy all his Plantations, and cast others into such a Form as modern Usage required; and give the same
            Directions to all his Tenants, unless he would submit to incur the Censure of Pride, Singularity,
            Aﬀectation, Ignorance, Caprice; and perhaps increase his Majesty&rsquo;s Displeasure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That the Admiration I appeared to be under, would cease or diminish when he had informed me of some
            Particulars, which probably I never heard of at Court, the People there being too much taken up in their own
            Speculations, to have Regard to what passed here below.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sum of his Discourse was to this Eﬀect. That about Forty Years ago* certain Persons went up to
            <em>Laputa</em>, either upon Business or Diversion; and after five Months Continuance, came back with a very
            little Smattering in Mathematicks, but full of Volatile Spirits acquired in that Airy Region. That these
            Persons upon their Return, began to dislike the Management of every Thing below; and fell into Schemes of
            putting all Arts, Sciences, Languages, and Mechanicks upon a new Foot. To this End they procured a Royal
            Patent for erecting an Academy of PROJECTORS* in <em>Lagado</em>: and the Humour prevailed so strongly among
            the People, that there is not a Town of any Consequence in the Kingdom without such an Academy. In these
            Colleges, the Professors contrive new Rules and Methods of Agriculture and Building, and new Instruments and
            Tools for all Trades and Manufactures, whereby, as they undertake, one Man shall do the Work of Ten; a
            Palace may be built in a Week, of Materials so durable as to last for ever without repairing. All the Fruits
            of the Earth shall come to Maturity at whatever Season we</p>

        <p>think fit to chuse,* and increase an Hundred Fold more than they do at present; with innumerable other happy
            Proposals. The only Inconvenience is, that none of these Projects are yet brought to Perfection; and in the
            mean time, the whole Country lies miserably waste, the Houses in Ruins, and the People without Food or
            Cloaths. By all which, instead of being discouraged, they are Fifty Times more violently bent upon
            prosecuting their Schemes, driven equally on by Hope and Despair: That, as for himself, being not of an
            enterprizing Spirit, he was content to go on in the old Forms; to live in the Houses his Ancestors had
            built, and act as they did in every Part of Life without Innovation. That, some few other Persons of Quality
            and Gentry had done the same; but were looked on with an Eye of Contempt and ill Will, as Enemies to Art,
            ignorant, and ill Commonwealthsmen,* preferring their own Ease and Sloth before the general Improvement of
            their Country.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His Lordship added, that he would not by any further Particulars prevent the Pleasure I should certainly take
            in viewing the grand Academy, whither he was resolved I should go. He only desired me to observe a ruined
            Building* upon the Side of a Mountain about three Miles distant, of which he gave me this Account. That he
            had a very convenient Mill within Half a Mile of his House, turned by a Current from a large River, and
            suﬃcient for his own Family as well as a great Number of his Tenants. That, about seven Years ago, a Club of
            those Projectors came to him with Proposals to destroy this Mill, and build another on the Side of that
            Mountain, on the long Ridge whereof a long Canal must be cut for a Repository of Water, to be conveyed up by
            Pipes and Engines to supply the Mill: Because the Wind and Air upon a Height agitated the Water, and thereby
            made it fitter for Motion: And because the Water descending down a Decliv-ity would turn the Mill with half
            the Current of a River whose Course is more upon a Level. He said, that being then not very well with the
            Court, and pressed by many of his Friends, he complyed with the Proposal; and after employing an Hundred Men
            for two Years, the Work miscarryed, the Projectors went oﬀ, laying the blame intirely upon him; railing at
            him ever since, and putting others upon the same Experiment, with equal Assurance of Success, as well as
            equal Disappointment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a few Days we came back to Town; and his Excellency, considering the bad Character he had in the Academy,
            would not go</p>

        <p>with me himself, but recommended me to a Friend of his to bear me Company thither. My Lord was pleased to
            represent me as a great Admirer of Projects, and a Person of much Curiosity and easy Belief; which indeed
            was not without Truth, for I had my self been a Sort of Projector in my younger Days.*</p>

            <em>described. The Arts wherein the Professors employ themselves.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h i s Academy is not an entire single Building, but a Continuation of several Houses* on both Sides of a
            Street; which growing waste,* was purchased and applyed to that Use.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was received very kindly by the Warden, and went for many Days to the Academy. Every Room hath in it one or
            more Projectors; and I believe I could not be in fewer than five Hundred Rooms.*</p>
        <p>The first Man I saw was of a meagre Aspect, with sooty Hands and Face, his Hair and Beard long, ragged and
            singed in several Places. His Clothes, Shirt, and Skin were all of the same Colour. He had been Eight Years
            upon a Project for extracting Sun-Beams out of Cucumbers,* which were to be put into Vials hermetically
            sealed, and let out to warm the Air in raw inclement Summers. He told me, he did not doubt in Eight Years
            more, he should be able to supply the Governors Gardens with Sun-shine at a reasonable Rate; but he
            complained that his stock was low, and intreated me to give him something as an Encouragement to Ingenuity,
            especially since this had been a very dear Season for Cucumbers. I made him a small Present, for my Lord had
            furnished me with Money on purpose, because he knew their Practice of begging from all who go to see them.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I went into another Chamber, but was ready to hasten back, being almost overcome with a horrible Stink.* My
            Conductor pressed me forward, conjuring me in a Whisper to give no Oﬀence, which would be highly resented;
            and therefore I durst not so much as stop my Nose. The Projector of this Cell was the most ancient Student
            of the Academy. His Face and Beard were of a pale Yellow; his Hands and Clothes dawbed over with Filth. When
            I was presented to him, he gave me a close Embrace, (a Compliment I could well have excused.) His Employment
            from his first coming into the Academy, was an Operation to reduce human Excrement to its original Food, by
            separating the several Parts, removing the Tincture</p>

        <p>168&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>which it receives from the Gall, making the Odour exhale, and scumming oﬀ the Saliva. He had a weekly
            Allowance from the Society, of a Vessel filled with human Ordure, about the Bigness of a <em>Bristol</em>
            Barrel.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I saw another at work to calcine Ice into Gunpowder; who likewise shewed me a Treatise he had written
            concerning the Malleability of Fire,* which he intended to publish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a most ingenious Architect who had contrived a new Method for building Houses, by beginning at the
            Roof, and work-ing downwards to the Foundation; which he justified to me by the like Practice of those two
            prudent Insects the Bee and the Spider.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a Man born blind,* who had several Apprentices in his own Condition: Their Employment was to mix
            Colours for Painters, which their Master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling. It was indeed
            my Misfortune to find them at that Time not very perfect in their Lessons; and the Professor himself
            happened to be generally mistaken: This Artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole Fraternity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In another Apartment I was highly pleased with a Projector, who had found a Device of plowing the Ground with
            Hogs,* to save the Charges of Plows, Cattle, and Labour. The Method is this: In an Acre of Ground you bury
            at six Inches Distance and eight deep, a Quantity of Acorns, Dates, Chestnuts, and other Maste* or
            Veget-ables whereof these Animals are fondest; then you drive six Hundred or more of them into the Field,
            where in a few Days they will root up the whole Ground in search of their Food, and make it fit for sowing,
            at the same time manuring it with their Dung. It is true, upon Experiment they found the Charge and Trouble
            very great, and they had little or no Crop. However, it is not doubted that this Invention may be capable of
            great Improvement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I went into another Room, where the Walls and Ceiling were all hung round with Cobwebs, except a narrow
            Passage for the Artist* to go in and out. At my Entrance he called aloud to me not to disturb his Webs. He
            lamented the fatal Mistake the World had been so long in of using Silk-Worms, while we had such plenty of
            domestick Insects, who infinitely excelled the former, because they understood how to weave as well as spin.
            And he proposed farther, that by employing Spiders, the Charge of dying Silks would be wholly</p>

        <p>saved; whereof I was fully convinced when he shewed me a vast Number of Flies most beautifully coloured,
            wherewith he fed his Spiders; assuring us, that the Webs would take a Tincture from them; and as he had them
            of all Hues, he hoped to fit every Body&rsquo;s Fancy, as soon as he could find proper Food for the Flies,
            of certain Gums, Oyls, and other glutinous Matter, to give a Strength and Consistence to the Threads.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was an Astronomer who had undertaken to place a Sun-Dial* upon the great Weather-Cock on the
            Town-House,* by adjusting the annual and diurnal Motions of the Earth and Sun, so as to answer and coincide
            with all accidental Turnings of the Wind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was complaining of a small Fit of the Cholick;* upon which my Conductor led me into a Room, where a great
            Physician resided, who was famous for curing that Disease by contrary Operations from the same Instrument.
            He had a large Pair of Bellows,* with a long slender Muzzle of Ivory. This he conveyed eight Inches up the
            Anus, and drawing in the Wind, he aﬃrmed he could make the Guts as lank as a dried Bladder. But when the
            Disease was more stubborn and violent, he let in the Muzzle while the Bellows were full of Wind, which he
            discharged into the Body of the Patient; then with-drew the Instrument to replenish it, clapping his Thumb
            strongly against the Orifice of the Fundament; and this being repeated three or four Times, the adventitious
            Wind would rush out, bringing the noxious along with it (like Water put into a Pump) and the Patient
            recovers. I saw him try both Experiments upon a Dog,* but could not discern any Eﬀect from the former. After
            the latter, the Animal was ready to burst, and made so violent a Discharge, as was very oﬀen-sive to me and
            my Companions. The Dog died on the Spot, and we left the Doctor endeavouring to recover him by the same
            Operation.</p>

        <p>I had hitherto seen only one Side of the Academy, the other being appropriated to the Advancers of
            speculative Learning; of whom I shall say something when I have mentioned one illustrious Person more, who
            is called among them <em>the universal Artist</em>.* He told us, he had been Thirty Years employing his
            Thoughts for the Improve-ment of human Life. He had two large Rooms full of wonderful Curiosities, and Fifty
            Men at work. Some were condensing Air into a dry tangible Substance, by extracting the Nitre, and letting

        <p>aqueous or fluid Particles percolate: Others softening Marbles for Pillows and Pin-cushions; others
            petrifying the Hoofs of a living Horse to preserve them from foundering. The Artist himself was at that Time
            busy upon two great designs: The first, to sow Land with Chaﬀ,* wherein he aﬃrmed the true seminal Virtue*
            to be contained, as he demonstrated by several Experiments which I was not skilful enough to comprehend. The
            other was, by a certain Composition of Gums, Minerals, and Vegetables outwardly applied, to prevent the
            Growth of Wool upon two young Lambs; and he hoped in a reasonable Time to propagate the Breed of naked
            Sheep* all over the Kingdom.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We crossed a Walk to the other Part of the Academy, where, as I have already said, the Projectors in
            speculative Learning resided.</p>
        <p>The first Professor I saw was in a very large Room, with Forty Pupils about him. After Salutation, observing
            me to look earnestly upon a Frame,* which took up the greatest Part of both the Length and Breadth of the
            Room; he said, perhaps I might wonder to see him employed in a Project for improving speculative Knowledge
            by practical and mechanical Operations. But the World would soon be sensible of its Usefulness; and he
            flattered himself, that a more noble exalted Thought never sprang in any other Man&rsquo;s Head. Every one
            knew how laborious the usual Method is of attaining to Arts and Sciences; whereas by his Contrivance, the
            most ignorant Person* at a reasonable Charge, and with a little bodily Labour, may write Books in
            Philosophy, Poetry, Politicks, Law, Mathematicks and Theology, without the least Assistance from Genius or
            Study. He then led me to the Frame, about the Sides whereof all his Pupils stood in Ranks. It was Twenty
            Foot square, placed in the Middle of the Room. The Superficies was composed of several Bits of Wood, about
            the Bigness of a Dye, but some larger than others. They were all linked together by slender Wires. These
            Bits of Wood were covered on every Square with Paper pasted on them; and on these Papers were written all
            the Words of their Language in their several Moods, Tenses, and Declensions, but without any Order. The
            Professor then desired me to observe, for he was going to set his Engine at work. The Pupils at his Command
            took each of them hold of an Iron Handle, whereof there were Forty Fixed round the Edges of the Frame; and
            giving them a sudden Turn, the whole Disposition of the Words was entirely changed. He then commanded Six
            and Thirty of the Lads to read the several Lines softly as they appeared upon the Frame; and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>172&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>where they found three or four Words together that might make Part of a Sentence, they dictated to the four
            remaining Boys who were Scribes. This Work was repeated three or four Times, and at every Turn the Engine
            was so contrived, that the Words shifted into new Places, as the square Bits of Wood moved upside down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Six Hours a-Day the young Students were employed in this Labour; and the Professor shewed me several Volumes
            in large Folio already collected, of broken Sentences, which he intended to piece together; and out of those
            rich Materials to give the World a complete Body of all Arts and Sciences, which however might be still
            improved, and much expedited, if the Publick would raise a Fund for making and employing five Hundred such
            Frames in <em>Lagado</em>, and oblige the Managers to contribute in common their several Collections.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He assured me, that this Invention had employed all his Thoughts from his Youth; that he had emptyed the
            whole Vocabulary into his frame, and made the strictest Computation of the general Proportion there is in
            Books between the Numbers of Particles, Nouns, and Verbs, and other Parts of Speech.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I made my humblest Acknowledgments to this illustrious Person for his great Communicativeness; and promised
            if ever I had the good Fortune to return to my native Country, that I would do him Justice, as the sole
            Inventor of this wonderful Machine; the Form and Contrivance of which I desired Leave to delineate upon
            Paper as in the Figure here annexed. I told him, although it were the Custom of our Learned in
            <em>Europe</em> to steal Inventions from each other,* who had thereby at least this Advantage, that it
            became a Controversy which was the right Owner; yet I would take such Caution, that he should have the
            Honour entire without a Rival.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We next went to the School of Languages,* where three Professors sat in Consultation upon improving that of
            their own Country.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first Project was to shorten Discourse* by cutting Polysyllables into one, and leaving out Verbs and
            Participles; because in Reality all things imaginable are but Nouns.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The other, was a Scheme for entirely abolishing all Words whatsoever: And this was urged as a great Advantage
            in Point of Health as well as Brevity. For, it is plain, that every Word we speak is in some Degree a
            Diminution of our Lungs* by Corrosion; and con-sequently contributes to the shortning of our Lives. An
            Expedient</p>

        <p>was therefore oﬀered, that since Words are only Names for <em>Things</em>,* it would be more convenient for
            all Men to carry about them, such <em>Things</em> as were necessary to express the particular Business they
            are to discourse on. And this Invention would certainly have taken Place, to the great Ease as well as
            Health of the Subject, if the Women in Conjunction with the Vulgar and Illiterate, had not threatened to
            raise a Rebellion, unless they might be allowed the Liberty to speak with their Tongues, after the Manner of
            their Forefathers: Such constant irreconcilable Enemies to Science are the common People.* However, many of
            the most Learned and Wise adhere to the new Scheme of expressing themselves by <em>Things</em>; which hath
            only this Inconvenience attending it; that if a Man&rsquo;s Business be very great, and of various Kinds, he
            must be obliged in Proportion to carry a greater Bundle of <em>Things</em> upon his Back, unless he can
            aﬀord one or two strong Servants to attend him. I have often beheld two of those Sages almost sinking under
            the Weight of their Packs, like Pedlars among us; who, when they met in the Streets, would lay down their
            Loads, open their Sacks, and hold Conversation for an Hour together; then put up their Implements, help each
            other to resume their Burthens, and take their Leave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, for short Conversations a Man may carry Implements in his Pockets and under his Arms, enough to supply
            him, and in his House he cannot be at a Loss; therefore the Room where Company meet who practice this Art,
            is full of all <em>Things</em> ready at Hand, requisite to furnish Matter for this Kind of artificial
            Converse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another great Advantage proposed by this Invention, was, that it would serve as an universal Language* to be
            understood in all civil-ized Nations, whose Goods and Utensils are generally of the same Kind, or nearly
            resembling, so that their Uses might easily be comprehended. And thus, Embassadors would be qualified to
            treat with foreign Princes or Ministers of State, to whose Tongues they were utter Strangers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was at the Mathematical School, where the Master taught his Pupils after a Method scarce imaginable to us
            in <em>Europe</em>. The Proposition and Demonstration were fairly written on a thin Wafer, with Ink composed
            of a Cephalick Tincture.* This the Student was to swallow upon a fasting Stomach, and for three Days
            following eat nothing but Bread and Water. As the Wafer digested, the Tincture mounted to his Brain, bearing
            the Proposition along with it. But the</p>

        <p>Success has not hitherto been answerable, partly by some Error in the <em>Quantum</em>* or Composition, and
            partly by the Perverseness of Lads; to whom this Bolus* is so nauseous, that they generally steal aside, and
            discharge it upwards before it can operate; neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an
            Abstinence as the Prescription requires.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>A further Account of the Academy. The Author proposeth some Improvements, which are honourably
                received.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I n the School of political Projectors I was but ill entertained; the Professors appearing in my Judgment
            wholly out of their Senses;* which is a Scene that never fails to make me melancholy. These unhappy People
            were proposing Schemes for persuading Monarchs to chuse Favourites upon the Score of their Wisdom, Capacity
            and Virtue; of teaching Ministers to consult the publick Good; of rewarding Merit, great Abilities, and
            eminent Services; of instructing Princes to know their true Interest, by placing it on the same Foun-dation
            with that of their People: Of chusing for Employments Persons qualified to exercise them; with many other
            wild impossible Chim&aelig;ras, that never entered before into the Heart of Man to conceive; and confirmed
            in me the old Observation, that there is nothing so extravagant and irrational which some Philosophers have
            not maintained for Truth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, however I shall so far do Justice to this Part of the Academy, as to acknowledge that all of them were
            not so visionary. There was a most ingenious Doctor who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole Nature
            and System of Government. This illustrious Person had very usefully employed his Studies in finding out
            eﬀectual Rem-edies for all Diseases and Corruptions, to which the several Kinds of publick Administration
            are subject by the Vices or Infirmities of those who govern, as well as by the Licentiousness of those who
            are to obey. For Instance: Whereas all Writers and Reasoners have agreed, that there is a strict universal
            Resemblance between the natural and the political Body; can there be anything more evident, than that the
            Health of both must be preserved, and the Diseases cured by the same Prescriptions? It is allowed, that
            Senates and great Councils are often troubled with redundant, ebullient,* and other peccant Humours;* with
            many Diseases of the Head, and more of the Heart; with strong Convulsions, with grievous Contractions of the
            Nerves and Sinews in both Hands, but especially the Right:* With Spleen, Flatus,* Vertigoes, and Deliriums;
            with scrophulous Tumours</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>176&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>full of f&oelig;tid purulent Matter; with sower frothy Ructations;* with Canine Appetites* and Crudeness of
            Digestion;* besides many others needless to mention. This Doctor therefore proposed, that upon the meeting
            of a Senate, certain Physicians should attend at the three first Days of their sitting, and at the Close of
            each Day&rsquo;s Debate, feel the Pulses of every Senator; after which having maturely considered, and
            consulted upon the Nature of the several Maladies, and the Methods of Cure; they should on the fourth Day
            return to the Senate-House, attended by their Apothecaries stored with proper Medicines; and before the
            Members sat, administer to each of them Lenitives, Aperitives, Abstersives, Corrosives, Restringents,
            Palliatives, Laxatives, Cephalalgicks, Ictericks, Apophlegmaticks, Acousticks, as their several Cases
            required,* and according as these Medicines should operate, repeat, alter, or omit them at the next Meeting.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This Project could not be of any great Expence to the Publick; and might, in my poor Opinion, be of much Use
            for the Dispatch of Business in those Countries where Senates have any Share in the legislative Power; beget
            Unanimity, shorten Debates, open a few Mouths which are now closed, and close many more which are now open;
            curb the Petulancy of the Young, and correct the Positiveness of the Old; rouze the Stupid, and damp the
            Pert.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Again; Because it is a general Complaint that the Favourites of Princes are troubled with short and weak
            Memories; the same Doctor proposed, that whoever attended a first Minister, after having told his Business
            with the utmost Brevity, and in the plainest Words; should at his Departure give the said Minister a Tweak
            by the Nose, or a Kick in the Belly, or tread on his Corns, or lug him thrice by both Ears, or run a Pin
            into his Breech, or pinch his Arm black and blue; to prevent Forgetfulness: And at every Levee Day repeat
            the same Operation, till the Business were done or absolutely refused.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He likewise directed, that every Senator in the great Council of a Nation, after he had delivered his
            Opinion, and argued in the Defence of it, should be obliged to give his Vote directly contrary; because if
            that were done, the Result would infallibly terminate in the Good of the Publick.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Parties in a State are violent, he oﬀered a wonderful Contrivance to reconcile them. The Method is this.

        <p>Hundred Leaders of each Party; you dispose them into Couples of such whose Heads are nearest of a Size; then
            let two nice Operators saw oﬀ the <em>Occiput</em> of each Couple at the same Time, in such a Manner that
            the Brain may be equally divided. Let the <em>Occiputs</em> thus cut oﬀ be interchanged, applying each to
            the Head of his opposite Party-man. It seems indeed to be a Work that requireth some Exactness; but the
            Professor assured us, that if it were dexterously performed, the Cure would be infallible. For he argued
            thus; that the two half Brains being left to debate the Matter between themselves within the Space of one
            Scull, would soon come to a good Under-standing, and produce that Moderation as well as Regularity of
            Thinking, so much to be wished for in the Heads of those, who imagine they came into the World only to watch
            and govern its Motion: And as to the Diﬀerence of Brains in Quantity or Quality, among those who are
            Directors in Faction; the Doctor assured us from his own Knowledge, that it was a perfect Trifle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I heard a very warm Debate between two Professors, about the most commodious and eﬀectual Ways and Means of
            raising Money without grieving the Subject. The first aﬃrmed, the justest Method would be to lay a certain
            Tax upon Vices and Folly; and the sum fixed upon every Man, to be rated after the fairest Manner by a Jury
            of his Neighbours. The second was of an Opinion dir-ectly contrary; to tax those Qualities of Body and Mind
            for which Men chiefly value themselves; the Rate to be more or less accord-ing to the Degrees of excelling;
            the Decision whereof should be left entirely to their own Breast. The highest Tax was upon Men, who are the
            greatest Favourites of the other Sex; and the Assess-ments according to the Number and Natures of the
            Favours they have received; for which they are allowed to be their own Vouchers. Wit, Valour, and Politeness
            were likewise proposed to be largely taxed, and collected in the same Manner, by every Person giving his own
            Word for the Quantum of what he possessed. But, as to Honour, Justice, Wisdom and Learning, they should not
            be taxed at all; because they are Qualifications of so singular a Kind, that no Man will either allow them
            in his Neighbour, or value them in himself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Women were proposed to be taxed according to their Beauty and Skill in Dressing; wherein they had the

        <p>To keep Senators in the Interest of the Crown, it was proposed that the Members should raﬄe for Employments;
            every Man first taking an Oath, and giving Security that he would vote for the Court, whether he won or no;
            after which the Losers had in their Turn the Liberty of raising upon the next Vacancy. Thus, Hope and
            Expect-ation would be kept alive; none would complain of broken Promises, but impute their Disappointments
            wholly to Fortune, whose Shoulders are broader and stronger than those of a ministry.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another Professor shewed me a large Paper of Instructions for discovering Plots and Conspiracies against the
            Government. He advised great Statesmen to examine into the Dyet of all suspected Persons; their Times of
            eating; upon which Side they lay in Bed; with which Hand they wiped their Posteriors; to take a strict View
            of their Excrements,* and from the Colour, the Odour, the Taste, the Consistence, the Crudeness, or Maturity
            of Digestion, form a Judgment of their Thoughts and Designs: Because Men are never so serious, thoughtful,
            and intent, as when they are at Stool; which he found by frequent Experiment: for in such Conjunctures,*
            when he used merely as a Trial to consider which was the best Way of murdering the King, his Ordure would
            have a Tincture of Green; but quite diﬀerent when he thought only of raising an Insurrection, or burning the
            Metropolis.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The whole Discourse was written with great Acuteness, containing many Observations both curious and useful
            for Politicians, but as I conceived not altogether compleat. This I ventured to tell the Author, and oﬀered
            if he pleased to supply him with some Add-itions. He received my Proposition with more Compliance than is
            usual among Writers, especially those of the Projecting Species; professing he would be glad to receive
            farther Information.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I told him, that in the Kingdom of <em>Tribnia</em>,* by the Natives called <em>Langden</em>,* where I had
            sojourned, the Bulk of the People consisted wholly of Discoverers, Witnesses, Informers, Accusers,
            Prosecutors, Evidences,* Swearers; together with their several subservient and subaltern Instruments; all
            under the Colours, the Conduct, and pay of Ministers and their Deputies. The Plots in that Kingdom* are
            usually the Workmanship of those Persons who desire to raise their own Characters of profound Politicians;

        <p>crazy Administration; to stifle or divert general Discontents; to fill their Coﬀers with Forfeitures;* and
            raise or sink the Opinion of publick Credit,* as either shall best answer their private Advantage. It is
            first agreed and settled among them, what suspected Persons shall be accused of a Plot: Then, eﬀectual Care
            is taken to secure all their Letters and other Papers, and put the Owners in Chains. These Papers are
            delivered to a Set of Artists very dextrous in finding out the mysterious Meanings of Words, Syllables and
            Letters. For Instance, they can decypher a Close-stool to signify a Privy-Council; a Flock of Geese, a
            Senate; a lame Dog,* an Invader;* the Plague, a standing Army;* a Buzard,* a Minister; the Gout, a High
            Priest;* a Gibbet, a Secretary of State; a Chamber pot, a Committee of Grandees; a Sieve,* a Court Lady; a
            Broom, a Revolution; a Mouse-trap, an Employment;* a bottomless Pit, the Treasury; a Sink, a C
            &mdash;&mdash; t;* a Cap and Bells, a Favourite; a broken Reed, a Court of Justice; an empty Tun, a General;
            a running Sore, the Administration.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When this Method fails, they have two others more eﬀectual; which the Learned among them call Acrosticks, and
            Anagrams. <em>First</em>, they can decypher all initial Letters into political Meanings: Thus, <em>N</em>,
            shall signify a Plot; <em>B</em>, a Regiment of Horse: <em>L</em>, a Fleet at Sea; Or, <em>secondly</em>, by
            transposing the Letters of the Alphabet, in any suspected Paper, they can lay open the deepest Designs of a
            dis-contented Party. So for Example, if I should say in a Letter to a Friend, <em>Our Brother</em> Tom
            <em>has just got the Piles</em>;* a Man of Skill in this Art would discover how the same Letters which
            compose that Sen-tence, may be analysed into the following words; <em>Resist, <strong>&mdash;</strong> a
                Plot</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>The Tour.</em>* And&nbsp; this&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; Anagrammatick</p>

        <p>The Professor made me great Acknowledgments for commun-icating these Observations, and promised to make
            honourable mention of me in his Treatise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I saw nothing in this Country that could invite me to a longer Continuance; and began to think of returning

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h e Continent of which this Kingdom is a part, extends itself, as I have Reason to believe, Eastward to
            that unknown Tract of <em>America</em>, Westward to <em>California</em>, and North to the Pacifick Ocean,
            which is not above an hundred and fifty Miles from <em>Lagado</em>; where there is a good Port and much
            Commerce with the great Island of <em>Luggnagg</em>, situated to the North-West* about 29 Degrees North
            Latitude, and 140 Longitude. The Island of <em>Luggnagg</em> stands South Eastward of <em>Japan</em>, about
            an hundred leagues distant. There is a strict Alliance between the <em>Japanese</em> Emperor and the King of
            <em>Luggnagg</em>, which aﬀords frequent Opportunities of sailing from one Island to the other. I determined
            therefore to direct my Course this Way, in order to my Return to <em>Europe</em>. I hired two Mules with a
            Guide to shew me the Way, and carry my small Baggage. I took leave of my noble Protector, who had shewn me
            so much Favour and made me a generous Present at my Departure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Journey was without any Accident or Adventure worth relating. When I arrived at the Port of
            <em>Maldonada</em>, (for so it is called) there was no Ship in the Harbour bound for <em>Luggnagg</em>, nor
            like to be in some Time. The Town is about as large as <em>Portsmouth</em>. I soon fell into some
            Acquaintance, and was very hospitably received. A Gentleman of Distinction said to me, that since the Ships
            bound for <em>Luggnagg</em> could not be ready in less than a Month, it might be no disagreeable Amusement
            for me to take a Trip to the little Island of <em>Glubbdubdrib</em>, about five Leagues to the South-West.
            He oﬀered himself and a Friend to accompany me, and that I should be provided with a small convenient Barque
            for the Voyage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>GLUBBDUBDRIB</em>,* as nearly as I can interpret the Word, signifies the Island of <em>Sorcerers</em> or
            <em>Magicians</em>. It is about one-third as large as the Isle of <em>Wight</em>, and extreamly fruitful: It
            is governed by the Head of a certain Tribe, who are all Magicians. This Tribe marries only among each other;

        <p>Prince or Governor. He hath a noble Palace, and a Park of about three thousand Acres, surrounded by a Wall of
            hewn Stone twenty Foot high. In this Park are several small Inclosures for Cattle, Corn and Gardening.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Governor and his Family are served and attended by Domesticks of a Kind somewhat unusual. By his Skill in
            Necromancy, he hath Power of calling whom he pleaseth from the Dead, and commanding their Service for
            twenty-four Hours, but no longer; nor can he call the same Persons up again in less than three Months,
            except upon very extraordinary Occasions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When we arrived at the Island, which was about Eleven in the Morning, one of the Gentlemen who accompanied
            me, went to the Governor, and desired Admittance for a Stranger, who came on purpose to have the Honour of
            attending on his Highness. This was immediately granted, and we all three entered the Gate of the Palace
            between two Rows of Guards, armed and dressed after a very antick* Manner, and something in their
            Countenances that made my Flesh creep with a Horror I cannot express. We passed through several Apartments,
            between Servants of the same Sort, ranked on each Side as before, till we came to the Chamber of Presence,
            where after three profound Obeysances, and a few general Questions, we were permitted to sit on three Stools
            near the lowest Step of his High-ness&rsquo;s Throne. He understood the Language of <em>Balnibarbi</em>,
            although it were diﬀerent from that of his Island. He desired me to give him some Account of my Travels; and
            to let me see that I should be treated without Ceremony, he dismissed all his Attendants with a Turn of his
            Finger, at which to my great Astonishment they van-ished in an Instant, like Visions in a Dream, when we
            awake on a sudden. I could not recover myself in some Time, till the Governor assured me that I should
            receive no Hurt; and observing my two Companions to be under no Concern, who had been often enter-tained in
            the same Manner, I began to take Courage; and related to his Highness a short History of my several
            Adventures, yet not with-out some Hesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the Place where I had seen
            those domestick Spectres. I had the Honour to dine with the Governor, where a new Set of Ghosts served up
            the Meat, and waited at Table. I new observed myself to be less terrified than I had been in the Morning. I
            stayed till Sun-set, but humbly desired his Highness to excuse me for not accepting his Invitation of
            lodging</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>182&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>in the Palace. My two Friends and I lay at a private House in the Town adjoining, which is the Capital of
            this little Island; and the next Morning we returned to pay our Duty to the Governor, as he was pleased to
            command us.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After this Manner we continued in the Island for ten Days, most Part of every Day with the Governor, and at
            Night in our Lodging. I soon grew so familiarized to the Sight of Spirits, that the third or fourth Time
            they gave me no Emotion at all; or if I had any Apprehensions left, my Curiosity prevailed over them. For
            his Highness the Governor ordered me to call up whatever Persons I would chuse to name,* and in whatever
            Numbers among all the Dead from the Beginning of the World to the present Time, and command them to answer
            any Questions I should think fit to ask; with this Condition, that my Questions must be confined within the
            Compass of the Times they lived in. And one Thing I might depend upon, that they would certainly tell me
            Truth, for Lying was a Talent of no Use in the lower World.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I made my humble Acknowledgments to his Highness for so great a Favour. We were in a Chamber, from whence
            there was a fair Prospect into the Park. And because my first Inclination was to be entertained with Scenes
            of Pomp and Magnificence. I desired to see <em>Alexander</em> the Great, at the Head of his Army just after
            the Battle of Arbela; which upon a Motion of the Governor&rsquo;s Finger immediately appeared in a large
            Field under the Window, where we stood. <em>Alexander</em> was called up into the Room; It was with great
            Diﬃculty that I understood his <em>Greek</em>, and had but little of my own. He assured me upon his Honour
            that he was not poisoned, but dyed of a Fever by excessive Drinking.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Next I saw <em>Hannibal</em> passing the <em>Alps</em>, who told me he had not a Drop of Vinegar* in his
            Camp.</p>
        <p>I saw <em>C&aelig;sar</em> and <em>Pompey</em> at the Head of their Troops, just ready to engage.* I saw the
            former in his last great Triumph.* I desired that the Senate of <em>Rome</em> might appear before me in one
            large Chamber, and a modern Representative, in Counterview, in another. The first seemed to be an Assembly
            of Heroes and Demy-Gods; the other a Knot of Pedlars, Pickpockets, Highwaymen and Bullies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Governor at my Request gave the Sign for <em>C&aelig;sar</em> and <em>Brutus</em> to advance towards us.
            I was struck with a profound Veneration at the Sight of <em>Brutus</em>;* and could easily discover the most
            consummate</p>

        <p>Virtue, the greatest Intrepidity, and Firmness of Mind, the truest Love of his Country, and general
            Benevolence for Mankind in every Lineament of his Countenance. I observed with much Pleasure that these two
            Persons were in good Intelligence* with each other; and <em>C&aelig;sar</em> freely confessed to me, that
            the greatest Actions of his own Life were not equal by many Degrees to the Glory of taking it away. I had
            the Honour to have much Conversation with <em>Brutus</em>; and was told that his Ancestor <em>Junius</em>,*
            <em>Socrates</em>,* <em>Epaminondas</em>,* <em>Cato the Younger</em>,* <em>Sir Thomas More</em>,* and
            himself, were perpetually together: A<em> Sextumvirate</em> to which all the Ages of the World cannot add a

            I chiefly fed mine Eyes with beholding the Destroyers of Tyrants and Usurpers, and the Restorers of Liberty
            to oppressed and injured Nations. But it is impossible to express the Satisfaction I received in my own
            Mind, after such a Manner as to make it a suitable Entertainment to the Reader.</p>

        <p><em>A further Account of</em> Glubbdubdrib<em>. Antient and Modern History corrected.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>H av i n g a Desire to see those Antients, who were most renowned for Wit and Learning, I set apart one Day
            on purpose. I proposed that <em>Homer</em>* and <em>Aristotle</em> might appear at the Head of all their
            Commentators; but these were so numerous that some Hundreds were forced to attend in the Court and outward
            Rooms of the Palace. I knew and could distinguish those two Heroes at first Sight, not only from the Croud,
            but from each other. <em>Homer</em> was the taller and comelier Person of the two, walked very erect for one
            of his Age, and his Eyes were the most quick and piercing* I ever beheld. <em>Aristotle</em> stooped much,
            and made use of a Staﬀ. His Visage was meager, his Hair lank and thin, and his Voice hollow. I soon
            discovered that both of them were perfect Strangers to the rest of the Company, and had never seen or heard
            of them before. And I had a Whisper from a Ghost, who shall be nameless, that these Commentators always kept
            in the most distant Quarters from their Principals in the lower World, through a Consciousness of Shame and
            Guilt, because they had so horribly misrepresented the Meaning of those Authors to Posterity. I introduced
            <em>Didymus</em>* and <em>Eustathius</em>* to <em>Homer</em>, and prevailed on him to treat them better than
            perhaps they deserved; for he soon found they wanted a Genius to enter into the Spirit of a Poet.* But
            <em>Aristotle</em> was out of all Patience* with the Account I gave him of <em>Scotus</em>* and
            <em>Ramus</em>,* as I presented them to him; and he asked them whether the rest of the Tribe were as great
            Dunces as themselves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I then desired the Governor to call up <em>Descartes</em>* and <em>Gassendi</em>,* with whom I prevailed to
            explain their Systems to <em>Aristotle</em>. This great Philosopher freely acknowledged his own Mistakes in
            Natural Philosophy, because he proceeded in many things upon Conjecture, as all Men must do; and he found,
            that <em>Gassendi</em>, who had made the Doctrine of <em>Epicurus</em> as palatable as he could, and the
            <em>Vortices</em> of <em>Descartes</em>, were equally exploded. He predicted the same fate to<em>
                Attraction</em>,* whereof the present Learned are such zealous Asserters. He said that new Systems of
            Nature were but new Fashions, which</p>

            flourish but a short Period of Time, and be out of Vogue when that was determined.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I spent five Days in conversing with many others of the antient Learned. I saw most of the first
            <em>Roman</em> Emperors. I prevailed on the Governor to call up <em>Eliogabalus</em>&rsquo;s* Cooks to dress
            us a Dinner; but they could not shew us much of their Skill, for want of Materials. A <em>Helot</em>* of
            <em>Agesilaus</em>* made us a Dish of <em>Spartan</em> Broth,* but I was not able to get down a second
            <em>Spoonful</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The two Gentlemen who conducted me to the Island were pressed by their private Aﬀairs to return in three
            Days, which I employed in seeing some of the modern Dead, who had made the greatest Figure for two or three
            Hundred Years past in our own and other Countries of <em>Europe</em>; and having been always a great Admirer
            of old illustrious Families,* I desired the Governor would call up a Dozen or two of Kings with their
            Ancestors in order, for eight or nine Generations. But my Disappointment was grevious and unexpected. For,
            instead of a long Train with Royal Diadems, I saw in one Family two Fiddlers, three spruce Courtiers, and an
            <em>Italian</em> Prelate. In another, a Barber, an Abbot, and two Cardinals. I have too great a Veneration
            for crowned Heads to dwell any longer on so nice a Subject: But as to Counts, Marquesses, Dukes, Earls, and
            the like, I was not so scrupulous. And I confess it was not without some Pleasure that I found myself able
            to trace the particu-lar Features, by which certain Families are distinguished up to their Originals. I
            could plainly discover from whence one family derives a long Chin; why a second hath abounded with Knaves
            for two Generations, and Fools for two more; why a third happened to be crack-brained, and a fourth to be
            Sharpers. Whence it came, what <em>Polydore Virgil</em>* says of a certain great House, <em>Nec Vir fortis,
                nec F&oelig;mina Casta</em>.* How Cruelty, Falsehood, and Cowardice grew to be Characteristicks by which
            certain Families are distinguished as much as by their Coat of Arms. Who first brought the <em>Pox</em>*
            into a noble House, which has lineally descended in scrophulous Tumours to their Posterity. Neither could I
            wonder at all this, when I saw such an Interruption of Lineages by Pages, Lacqueys, Valets, Coachmen,
            Gamesters, Fidlers, Players, Captains, and Pick-pockets.</p>

        <p>I was chiefly disgusted with modern History. For having strictly examined all the Persons of greatest Name in
            the Courts of Princes for an Hundred Years past, I found how the World had been misled by prostitute
            Writers, to ascribe the greatest Exploits in War to Cowards, the wisest Counsel to Fools, Sincerity to
            Flatterers, <em>Roman</em> Virtue to Betrayers of their Country, Piety to Atheists, Chastity to Sodomites,
            Truth to Informers. How many innocent and excellent Persons had been condemned to Death or Banishment, by
            the prac-tising of great Ministers upon the Corruption of Judges, and the Malice of Factions. How many
            Villains had been exalted to the high-est Places of Trust, Power, Dignity, and Profit: How great a Share in
            the Motions and Events of Courts, Councils, and Senates might be challenged by Bawds, Whores, Pimps,
            Parasites, and Buﬀoons: How low an Opinion I had of human Wisdom and Integrity, when I was truly informed of
            the Springs and Motives of great Enterprizes and Revolutions in the World, and of the contemptible
            Accidents* to which they owed their Success.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here I discovered the Roguery and Ignorance of those who pretend to write <em>Anecdotes</em>, or secret
            History;* who send so many Kings to their Graves with a Cup of Poison; will repeat the Discourse between a
            Prince and chief Minister, where no Witness was by; unlock the Thoughts and Cabinets of Embassadors and
            Secretaries of State; and have the perpetual Misfortune to be mis-taken. Here I discovered the true Causes
            of many great Events that have surprized the World: How a Whore can govern the Back-stairs, the Back-stairs
            a Council, and the Council a Senate. A General confessed in my Presence, that he got a Victory purely by the
            Force of Cowardice and ill Conduct: And an Admiral,* that for want of proper Intelligence, he beat the Enemy
            to whom he intended to betray the Fleet. Three Kings protested to me, that in their whole Reigns they never
            did once prefer any Person of Merit, unless by Mistake or Treachery of some Minister in whom they confided:
            Neither would they do it if they were to live again; and they shewed with great Strength of Reason that the
            Royal Throne could not be supported without Corruption; because that positive, confident, restive Temper,
            which Virtue infused into Man, was a perpetual Clog to publick Business.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had the Curiosity to enquire in a particular Manner, by what Method great Numbers had procured to
            themselves high Titles of</p>

        <p>Honour, and prodigious Estates; and I confined my Enquiry to a very modern Period: However, without grating
            upon present Times, because I would be sure to give no Oﬀence even to Foreigners, (for I hope the Reader
            need not be told that I do not in the least intend my own Country in what I say upon this Occasion) a great
            Number of Persons concerned were called up, and upon a very slight Examin-ation, discovered such a Scene of
            Infamy, that I cannot reflect upon it without some Seriousness. Perjury, Oppression, Subornation, Fraud,
            Panderism, and the like <em>In</em><em>fi</em><em>rmities</em> were amongst the most excusable Arts they had
            to mention; and for these I gave, as it was reasonable, due Allowance. But when some confessed they owed
            their Greatness and Wealth to Sodomy or Incest; others to the pros-tituting of their own Wives and
            Daughters; others to the betraying their Country or their Prince; some to poisoning, more to the per-verting
            of Justice in order to destroy the Innocent: I hope I may be pardoned if these Discoveries inclined me
            little to abate of that profound Veneration which I am naturally apt to pay to Persons of high Rank, who
            ought to be treated with the utmost Respect due to their sublime Dignity, by us their Inferiors.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had often read of some great Services done to Princes and States, and desired to see the Persons by whom
            those Services were per-formed. Upon Enquiry I was told, that their Names were to be found on no Record,
            except a few of them whom History hath represented as the vilest Rogues and Traitors. As to the rest, I had
            never once heard of them. They all appeared with dejected Looks, and in the meanest Habit; most of them
            telling me they died in Poverty and Disgrace, and the rest on a Scaﬀold or a Gibbet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Among the rest there was one Person whose Case appeared a little singular. He had a Youth about Eighteen
            Years old standing by his Side. He told me, he had for many Years been Commander of a Ship; and in the Sea
            Fight of <em>Actium</em>,* had the good Fortune to break through the Enemy&rsquo;s great Line of Battle,
            sink three of their Capital Ships, and take a fourth, which was the sole Cause of <em>Antony&rsquo;s</em>
            Flight,* and of the Victory that ensued: That the Youth standing by him, his only Son, was killed in the
            Action. He added, that upon the Confidence of some Merit, the War being at an End, he went to <em>Rome</em>,
            and solicited at the Court of <em>Augustus</em>* to be preferred to a greater Ship, whose Commander had been
            killed; but without any regard to his Pretensions, it was given to a Boy who had never seen</p>

        <p>the Sea, the son of a <em>Libertina</em>,* who waited on one of the Emperor&rsquo;s Mistresses. Returning
            back to his own Vessel, he was charged with Neglect of Duty, and the Ship given to a favourite Page of
            <em>Publicola</em>* the Vice-Admiral; whereupon he retired to a poor Farm, at a great Distance from
            <em>Rome</em>, and there ended his Life. I was so curious to know the Truth of this Story, that I desired
            <em>Agrippa</em>* might be called, who was Admiral in that Fight. He appeared, and confirmed the whole
            Account, but with much more Advantage to the Captain, whose Modesty had extenuated or concealed a great Part
            of his Merit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was surprized to find Corruption grown so high and so quick in that Empire, by the Force of Luxury so
            lately introduced; which made me less wonder at many parallel Cases in other Countries, where Vices of all
            Kinds have reigned so much longer, and where the whole Praise as well as Pillage hath been engrossed by the
            chief Commander,* who perhaps had the least Title to either.</p>
        <p>As every Person called up made exactly the same Appearance he had done in the World, it gave me melancholy
            Reflections to observe how much the Race of human Kind was degenerate among us, within these Hundred Years
            past. How the Pox under all its Consequences and Denominations had altered every Lineament of an
            <em>English</em> Countenance: shortened the Size of Bodies, unbraced the Nerves, relaxed the Sinews and
            Muscles, introduced a sallow Complexion, and rendered the Flesh loose and <em>rancid</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I descended so low as to desire that some <em>English</em> Yeomen of the old Stamp,* might be summoned to
            appear; once so famous for the Simplicity of their Manners, Dyet and Dress; for Justice in their Dealings;
            for their true Spirit of Liberty; for their Valour and Love of their Country. Neither could I be wholly
            unmoved after compar-ing the Living with the Dead, when I considered how all these pure native Virtues were
            prostituted for a Piece of Money by their Grand-children; who in selling their Votes, and managing at
            Elections* have acquired every Vice and Corruption that can possibly be learned in a Court.</p>

                great Lenity to his Subjects.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h e day of our Departure being come, I took leave of his Highness the Governor of <em>Glubbdubdrib</em>,
            and returned with my two com-panions to <em>Maldonada</em>, where after a Fortnight&rsquo;s waiting, a Ship
            was ready to sail for <em>Luggnagg</em>. The two Gentlemen and some others were so generous and kind as to
            furnish me with Provisions, and see me on Board. I was a Month in this Voyage. We had one violent Storm, and
            were under a Necessity of steering Westward to get into the Trade-Wind, which holds for above sixty Leagues.
            On the 21st of <em>April</em>, 1708, we sailed into the River of <em>Clumegnig</em>, which is a Sea-port
            Town, at the South-East Point of <em>Luggnagg</em>. We cast Anchor within a League of the Town, and made a
            Signal for a Pilot. Two of them came on Board in less than half an Hour, by whom we were guided between
            certain Shoals and Rocks, which are very dangerous in the Passage, to a large Basin, where a Fleet may ride
            in Safety within a Cable&rsquo;s Length of the Town-Wall.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some of our Sailors, whether out of Treachery or Inadvertence, had informed the Pilots that I was a Stranger
            and a great Traveller, whereof these gave Notice to a Custom-House Oﬃcer, by whom I was examined very
            strictly upon my landing. This Oﬃcer spoke to me in the Language of <em>Balnibarbi</em>, which by the Force
            of much Commerce is generally understood in that Town, especially by Seamen, and those employed in the
            Customs. I gave him a short Account of some Particulars, and made my Story as plausible and consistent as I
            could; but I thought it necessary to disguise my Coun-try, and call myself an <em>Hollander</em>; because my
            Intentions were for Japan, and I knew the <em>Dutch</em> were the only <em>Europeans</em> permitted to enter
            into that Kingdom.* I therefore told the Oﬃcer, that having been shipwrecked on the Coast of
            <em>Balnibarbi</em>, and cast on a Rock, I was received up into <em>Laputa</em>, or the flying Island (of
            which he had often heard) and was now endeavouring to get to <em>Japan</em>, from whence I might find a
            Convenience of returning to my own</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>190&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>Country. The Oﬃcer said, I must be confined till he could receive Orders from Court, for which he would write
            immediately, and hoped to receive an Answer in a Fortnight. I was carried to a con-venient Lodging, with a
            Centry placed at the Door; however I had the Liberty of a large Garden, and was treated with Humanity
            enough, being maintained all the Time at the King&rsquo;s Charge. I was visited by several Persons, chiefly
            out of Curiosity, because it was reported that I came from Countries very remote, of which they had never
            heard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I hired a young Man who came in the same Ship to be an Interpreter; he was a Native of <em>Luggnagg</em>, but
            had lived some Years at <em>Maldonada</em>, and was a perfect Master of both Languages. By his Assistance I
            was able to hold a Conversation with those who came to visit me; but this consisted only of their Questions
            and my Answers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Dispatch came from Court about the Time we expected. It contained a Warrant for conducting me and my
            Retinue to <em>Traldragdubb</em> or <em>Trildrogdrib</em>, (for it is pronounced both Ways as near as I can
            remember) by a Party of Ten Horse. All my Retinue was that poor Lad for an Interpreter, whom I persuaded
            into my Service. And at my humble Request we had each of us a Mule to ride on. A Messenger was dispatched
            half a Day&rsquo;s Journey before us, to give the King Notice of my Approach, and to desire that his Majesty
            would please appoint a Day and Hour, when it would be his gracious Pleas-ure that I might have the Honour to
            <em>lick the Dust</em>* <em>before his Footstool.</em> This is the Court Style, and I found it to be more
            than Matter of Form: For upon my Admittance two Days after my Arrival, I was commanded to crawl on my Belly,
            and lick the Floor as I advanced; but on account of my being a Stranger, Care was taken to have it so clean
            that the Dust was not oﬀensive. However, this was a peculiar Grace, not allowed to any but Persons of the
            highest Rank, when they desire an Admittance: Nay, sometimes the Floor is strewed with Dust on purpose, when
            the Person to be admitted happens to have powerful Enemies at Court: And I have seen a great Lord with his
            Mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper Distance from the Throne, he was not able to speak a
            Word. Neither is there any Remedy, because it is capital for those who receive an Audience to spit or wipe
            their Mouths in his Majesty&rsquo;s Presence. There is indeed another Custom, which I cannot altogether
            approve of. When the King hath a Mind to put any of his Nobles to Death in a gentle</p>

        <p>indulgent Manner; he commands to have the Floor strowed with a certain brown Powder, of a deadly Composition,
            which being licked up infallibly kills him in twenty-four Hours. But in Justice to this Prince&rsquo;s great
            Clemency, and the Care he has of his Subjects Lives, (wherein it were much to be wished that the Monarchs of
            <em>Europe</em> would imitate him) it must be mentioned for his Honour, that strict Orders are given to have
            the infected Parts of the Floor well washed after every such Execution; which if his Domesticks neglect,
            they are in Danger of incurring his Royal Displeasure. I my self heard him give Directions, that one of his
            Pages should be whipt, whose Turn it was to give Notice about washing the Floor after an Execu-tion, but
            maliciously had omitted it; by which Neglect a young Lord of great Hopes coming to an Audience, was
            unfortunately poisoned, although the King at that Time had no Design against his Life. But this good Prince
            was so gracious, as to forgive the poor Page his Whipping, upon Promise that he would do so no more, without
            special Orders.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To return from this Digression; when I had crept within four Yards of the Throne, I raised my self gently
            upon my Knees, and then striking my Forehead seven Times against the Ground, I pronounced the following
            Words, as they had been taught me the Night before, <em>Ickpling Glo</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>throbb Squutserumm
                blhiop Mlashnalt Zwin tnodbalkgu</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>h Slhiophad Gurdlubh Asht.</em> This is the
            Compli-ment established by the Laws of the Land for all Persons admitted to the King&rsquo;s Presence. It
            may be rendered into <em>English</em> thus: <em>May your c&oelig;lestial Majesty out-live the Sun, eleven
                Moons and an half.</em> To this the King returned some Answer, which although I could not under-stand,
            yet I replied as I had been directed: <em>Fluft drin Yalerick Dwuldum prastrad mirplush</em>, which properly
            signifies, <em>My Tongue is in the Mouth of my Friend</em>; and by this Expression was meant that I desired
            leave to bring my Interpreter; whereupon the young Man already mentioned was accordingly introduced; by
            whose Interven-tion I answered as many Questions as his Majesty could put in above an Hour. I spoke in the
            <em>Balnibarbian</em> Tongue, and my Interpreter delivered my Meaning in that of <em>Luggnagg</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The King was much delighted with my Company, and ordered his <em>Bli</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>marklub</em> or High
            Chamberlain to appoint a Lodging in the Court for me and my Interpreter, with a daily Allowance for my
            Table, and a large Purse of Gold for my common Expences.</p>

        <p>I stayed three Months in this Country out of perfect Obedience to his Majesty, who was pleased highly to
            favour me, and made me very honourable Oﬀers. But I thought it more consistent with Prudence and Justice to
            pass the Remainder of my Days with my Wife and Family.</p>

                Conversations between the Author and some eminent Persons upon that Subject.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h e Luggnuggians are a polite and generous People, and although they are not without some Share of that
            Pride which is peculiar to all <em>Eastern</em> Countries, yet they shew themselves courteous to Strangers,
            especially such who are countenanced by the Court. I had many Acquaintance among Persons of the best
            Fashion, and being always attended by my Interpreter, the Conversation we had was not disagreeable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One Day in much good Company, I was asked by a Person of Quality, whether I had seen any of their
            <em>Struldbrugs</em> or <em>Immortals</em>. I said I had not; and desired he would explain to me what he
            meant by such an Appellation, applyed to a mortal Creature. He told me, that sometimes, although very
            rarely, a Child happened to be born in a Family with a red circular Spot in the Forehead, directly over the
            left Eye-brow, which was an infallible Mark that it should never dye. The Spot, as he described it, was
            about the Compass of a Silver Three-pence, but in the Course of Time grew larger, and changed its Colour;
            for at Twelve Years old it became green, so continued till Five and Twenty, then turned to a deep blue; at
            Five and Forty it grew coal black, and as large as an <em>English</em> Shilling; but never admitted any
            farther Alteration. He said these Births were so rare, that he did not believe there could be above Eleven
            Hundred <em>Struldbrugs</em> of both Sexes in the whole Kingdom, of which he computed about Fifty in the
            Metropolis, and among the rest a young Girl born about three Years ago. That, these Productions were not
            peculiar to any Family, but a mere Eﬀect of Chance; and the Children of the <em>Struldbrugs</em> themselves,
            were equally mortal with the rest of the People.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible Delight upon hearing this Account: And the Person
            who gave it me happen-ing to understand the <em>Balnibarbian</em> Language, which I spoke very well, I could
            not forbear breaking out into Expressions perhaps a</p>

        <p>little too extravagant. I cryed out as in a Rapture; Happy Nation, where every Child hath at least a Chance
            for being immortal! Happy People who enjoy so many living Examples of antient Virtue, and have Masters ready
            to instruct them in the Wisdom of all former Ages! But, happiest* beyond all Comparison are those excellent
            <em>Struldbrugs</em>, who being born exempt from that universal Calamity of human Nature, have their Minds
            free and disingaged, without the Weight and Depression of Spirits caused by the continual Apprehension of
            Death. I discovered my Admiration that I had not observed any of these illustrious Persons at Court; the
            black Spot on the Fore-head, being so remarkable a Distinction, that I could not have easily overlooked it:
            And it was impossible that his Majesty, a most judicious Prince, should not provide himself with a good
            Number of such wise and able Counsellors. Yet perhaps the Virtue of those Reverend Sages was too strict for
            the corrupt and libertine Manners of a Court. And we often find by Experience, that young Men are too
            opinionative and volatile to be guided by the sober Dictates of their Seniors. However, since the King was
            pleased to allow me Access to his Royal Person, I was resolved upon the very first Occasion to deliver my
            Opinion to him on this Matter freely and at large, by the Help of my Interpreter; and whether he would
            please to take my Advice or no, yet in one Thing I was determined, that his Majesty having frequently oﬀered
            me an Establishment in this Country, I would with great Thankfulness accept the Favour, and pass my Life
            here in the Conversation of those superiour Beings the <em>Struldbrugs</em>, if they would please to admit
            me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Gentleman to whom I addressed my Discourse, because (as I have already observed) he spoke the Language of
            <em>Balnibarbi</em>, said to me with a Sort of a Smile, which usually ariseth from Pity to the Ignorant,
            that he was glad of any Occasion to keep me among them, and desired my Permission to explain to the Company
            what I had spoke. He did so; and they talked together for some time in their own Language, whereof I
            understood not a Syllable, neither could I observe by their Countenances what Impression my Discourse had
            made on them. After a short Silence, the same Person told me, that his Friends and mine (so he thought fit
            to express himself) were very much pleased with the judicious Remarks I had made on the great Happiness and
            Advantages of immortal Life; and they were desirous to know in a particular Manner, what Scheme of Living I
            should</p>

        <p>have formed to myself, if it had fallen to my Lot to have been born a <em>Struldbrug.</em></p>
        <p>I answered, it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a Subject, especially to me who have been
            often apt to amuse myself with Visions of what I should do if I were a King, a General, or a great Lord: and
            upon this very Case I had frequently run over the whole System how I should employ myself, and pass the Time
            if I were to live for ever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That, if it had been my good Fortune to come into the World a <em>Struldbrug</em>; as soon as I could
            discover my own Happiness by under-standing the Diﬀerence between Life and Death, I would first resolve by
            all Arts and Methods whatsoever to procure myself Riches: In the Pursuit of which, by Thrift and Management,
            I might reasonably expect in about two Hundred Years to be the wealthiest Man in the Kingdom. In the second
            Place, I would from my earliest Youth apply myself to the Study of Arts and Sciences, by which I should
            arrive in time to excel all others in Learning. Lastly, I would carefully record every Action and Event of
            Consequence that happened in the Publick, impartially draw the Characters of the several Successions of
            Princes, and great Ministers of State; with my own Observations on every Point. I would exactly set down the
            several Changes in Customs, Language, Fashion of Dress, Dyet and Diver-sions. By all which Acquirements, I
            should be a living Treasury of Knowledge and Wisdom, and certainly become the Oracle of the Nation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I would never marry after Threescore,* but live in an hospitable Manner, yet still on the saving Side. I
            would entertain myself in forming and directing the Minds of hopeful young Men, by convincing them from my
            own Remembrance, Experience and Observation, fortified by numerous Examples, of the Usefulness of Virtue in
            publick and private Life. But, my choise and constant Companions should be a Sett of my own immortal
            Brotherhood, among whom I would elect a Dozen from the most ancient down to my own Contemporaries. Where any
            of these wanted Fortunes, I would provide them with convenient Lodges round my own Estate, and have some of
            them always at my Table, only mingling a few of the most valuable among you Mortals, whom Length of Time
            would harden me to lose with little or no Reluctance, and treat your Posterity after the same Manner; just
            as a Man diverts himself with the annual</p>

        <p>Succession of Pinks and Tulips in his Garden, without regretting the Loss of those which withered the
            preceding Year.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These <em>Struldbrugs</em> and I would mutually communicate our Observations and Memorials through the Course
            of Time; remark the several Gradations by which Corruption steals into the World, and oppose it in every
            Step, by giving perpetual Warning and Instruction to Mankind; which, added to the strong Influence of our
            own Example, would probably prevent that continual Degeneracy of human Nature, so justly complained of in
            all Ages.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Add to all this, the Pleasure of seeing the various Revolutions of States and Empires; the Changes in the
            lower and upper World;* antient Cities in Ruins, and obscure Villages become the Seats of Kings. Famous
            Rivers lessening into shallow Brooks; the Ocean leaving one Coast dry, and overwhelming another: The
            Discovery of many Countries yet unknown. Barbarity over-running the politest Nations, and the most barbarous
            becoming civilized. I should then see the Discovery of the <em>Longitude</em>,* the <em>perpetual
                Motion</em>,* the <em>universal Medicine</em>,* and many other great Inventions brought to the utmost
            Perfection.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What wonderful Discoveries should we make in Astronomy, by outliving and confirming our own Predictions; by
            observing the Progress and Returns of Comets, with the Changes of Motion in the Sun, Moon and Stars.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I enlarged upon many other Topicks, which the natural Desire of endless Life and sublunary Happiness could
            easily furnish me with. When I had ended, and the Sum of my Discourse had been inter-preted as before, to
            the rest of the Company, there was a good Deal of Talk among them in the Language of the Country, not
            without some Laughter at my Expence. At last the same Gentleman who had been my Interpreter, said, he was
            desired by the rest to set me right in a few Mistakes, which I had fallen into through the common Imbecility
            of human Nature, and upon that Allowance was less answerable for them. That, this Breed of
            <em>Struldbrugs</em> was peculiar to their Country, for there were no such People either in
            <em>Balnibarbi</em> or <em>Japan</em>, where he had the Honour to be Embassador from his Majesty, and found
            the Natives in both those Kingdoms very hard to believe that the Fact was possible; and it appeared from my
            Astonishment when he first mentioned the Matter to me, that I received it as a Thing wholly new, and
            scarcely to be credited. That</p>

        <p>in the two Kingdoms above-mentioned, where during his Residence he had conversed very much, he observed long
            Life to be the uni-versal Desire and Wish of Mankind. That, whoever had one foot in the Grave, was sure to
            hold back the other as strongly as he could. That the oldest had still Hopes of living one Day longer, and
            looked on Death as the greatest Evil, from which Nature always prompted him to retreat; only in this Island
            of <em>Luggnagg</em>, the Appetite for living was not so eager, from the continual Example of the
            <em>Struldbrugs</em> before their Eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That the System of Living contrived by me was unreasonable and unjust, because it supposed a Perpetuity of
            Youth, Health, and Vigour, which no Man could be so foolish to hope, however extrava-gant he may be in his
            Wishes. That, the Question therefore was not whether a Man would chuse to be always in the Prime of Youth,
            attended with Prosperity and Health; but how he would pass a per-petual Life under all the usual
            Disadvantages which old Age brings along with it. For although few Men will avow their Desires of being
            immortal upon such hard Conditions, yet in the two Kingdoms before-mentioned of <em>Balnibarbi</em> and
            <em>Japan</em>, he observed that every Man desired to put oﬀ Death for some time longer, let it approach
            ever so late; and he rarely heard of any Man who died willingly, except he were incited by the Extremity of
            Grief or Torture. And he appealed to me whether in those Countries I had travelled as well as my own, I had
            not observed the same general Disposition.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After this Preface, he gave me a particular Account of the <em>Struldbrugs</em> among them. He said they
            commonly acted like Mortals, till about Thirty Years old, after which by Degrees they grew melancholy and
            dejected, increasing in both till they came to Four-score. This he learned from their own Confession; for
            otherwise there not being above two or three of that Species born in an Age, they were too few to form a
            general Observation by. When they came to Fourscore Years, which is reckoned the Extremity of living in this
            Country, they had not only all the Follies and Infirmities of other old Men, but many more which arose from
            the dreadful Prospect of never dying. They were not only opinionative, peevish, covetous, morose, vain,
            talkative; but uncapable of Friendship, and dead to all natural Aﬀection, which never descended below their
            Grand-children. Envy and impotent Desires, are their prevailing Passions. But those Objects against which
            their Envy seems principally</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>198&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>directed, are the Vices of the younger Sort, and the Deaths of the old. By reflecting on the former, they
            find themselves cut oﬀ from all Possibility of Pleasure; and whenever they see a Funeral, they lament and
            repine that others have gone to an Harbour of Rest, to which they themselves never can hope to arrive. They
            have no Remembrance of any thing but what they learned and observed in their Youth and middle Age, and even
            that is very imperfect: And for the Truth or Particulars of any Fact, it is safer to depend on common
            Traditions than upon their best Recollections. The least miserable among them, appear to be those who turn
            to Dotage, and entirely lose their Memories; these meet with more Pity and Assistance, because they want
            many bad Qualities which abound in others.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If a <em>Struldbrug</em> happen to marry one of his own Kind, the Marriage is dissolved of Course by the
            Courtesy of the Kingdom,* as soon as the younger of the two comes to be Fourscore. For the Law thinks it a
            reasonable Indulgence, that those who are condemned without any Fault of their own to a perpetual
            Continuance in the World, should not have their Misery doubled by the Load of a Wife.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As soon as they have completed the Term of Eighty Years, they are looked on as dead in Law; their Heirs
            immediately succeed to their Estates, only a small Pittance is reserved for their Support; and the poor ones
            are maintained at the publick Charge. After that Period they are held incapable of any Employment of Trust
            or Profit; they cannot purchase Lands, or take Leases, neither are they allowed to be Witnesses in any
            Cause, either Civil or Criminal, not even for the Decision of Meers* and Bounds.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At Ninety* they lose their Teeth and Hair; they have at that Age no Distinction of Taste, but eat and drink
            whatever they can get, without Relish or Appetite. The Diseases they were subject to, still continue without
            encreasing or diminishing. In talking they forget the common Appellation of Things, and the Names of
            Persons, even of those who are their nearest Friends and Relations. For the same Reason they never can amuse
            themselves with reading, because their Memory will not serve to carry them from the Beginning of a Sentence
            to the End; and by this Defect they are deprived of the only Entertainment whereof they might otherwise be
            capable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Language of this Country being always upon the Flux,* the <em>Struldbrugs</em> of one Age do not
            understand those of another; neither are they able after two Hundred Years to hold any Conversation</p>

        <p>(farther than by a few general Words) with their Neighbours the Mortals; and thus they lye under the
            Disadvantage of living like Foreigners in their own Country.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was the Account given me of the <em>Struldbrugs</em>, as near as I can remember. I afterwards saw five
            or six of diﬀerent Ages, the youngest not above two Hundred Years old, who were brought to me at several
            Times by some of my Friends; but although they were told that I was a great Traveller, and had seen all the
            World, they had not the least Curiosity to ask me a Question; only desired I would give them
            <em>Slumskudask</em>, or a Token of Remembrance; which is a modest Way of begging, to avoid the Law that
            strictly forbids it, because they are provided for by the Publick, although indeed with a very scanty
            Allowance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They are despised and hated by all Sorts of People: When one of them is born, it is reckoned ominous, and
            their Birth is recorded very particularly; so that you may know their Age by consulting the Registry, which
            however hath not been kept above a Thousand Years past, or at least hath been destroyed by Time or publick
            Disturb-ances. But the usual Way of computing how old they are, is by asking them what Kings or great
            Persons they can remember, and then consulting History; for infallibly the last Prince in their Mind did not
            begin his Reign after they were Fourscore Years old.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were the most mortifying Sight I ever beheld; and the Women more horrible than the Men. Besides the
            usual Deformities in extreme old Age, they acquired an additional Ghastliness in Proportion to their Number
            of Years, which is not to be described; and among half a Dozen I soon distinguished which was the eldest,
            although there were not above a Century or two between them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Reader will easily believe, that from what I had heard and seen, my keen Appetite for Perpetuity of Life
            was much abated. I grew heartily ashamed of the pleasing Visions I had formed; and thought no Tyrant could
            invent a Death into which I would not run with Pleasure from such a Life. The King heard of all that had
            passed between me and my Friends upon this Occasion, and rallied me very pleasantly; wishing I would send a
            Couple of <em>Struldbrugs</em> to my own Country, to arm our People against the Fear of Death; but this it
            seems is forbidden by the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom; or else I should have been well content with the
            Trouble and Expence of transporting them.</p>

        <p>I could not but agree, that the Laws of this Kingdom relating to the <em>Struldbrugs</em>, were founded upon
            the strongest Reasons, and such as any other Country would be under the Necessity of enacting in the like
            Circumstances. Otherwise, as Avarice is the necessary Consequent of old Age, those Immortals would in time
            become Proprietors of the whole Nation, and engross the Civil Power; which, for want of Abilities to manage,
            must end in the Ruin of the Publick.</p>

            <li>t h o u g h t this Account of the <em>Struldbrugs</em> might be some Entertainment to the Reader,
                because it seems to be a little out of the common Way; at least, I do not remember to have met the like
                in any Book of Travels* that hath come to my Hands: And if I am deceived, my Excuse must be, that it is
                necessary for Travellers, who describe the same Country, very often to agree in dwelling on the same
                Particulars, without deserving the Censure of having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before

        <p>There is indeed a perpetual Commerce between this Kingdom and the great Empire of <em>Japan</em>; and it is
            very probable that the <em>Japanese</em> Authors may have given some Account of the <em>Struldbrugs</em>;
            but my Stay in <em>Japan</em> was so short, and I was so entirely a Stranger to the Language, that I was not
            qualified to make any Enquiries. But</p>

            with a Letter of Recommendation under his own Hand to the Emperor of <em>Japan</em>. He likewise presented
            me with four Hundred and forty-four large Pieces of Gold (this Nation delighting in even Numbers) and a red
            Diamond* which I sold in <em>England</em> for Eleven Hundred Pounds.</p>
        <p>On the 6th Day of <em>May</em>, 1709, I took a solemn Leave of his Majesty, and all my Friends. This Prince
            was so gracious as to order a Guard to conduct me to <em>Glanguenstald</em>, which is a Royal Port to the
            <em>South-West</em> Part of the Island. In six Days I found a Vessel ready to carry me to <em>Japan</em>;
            and spent fifteen Days in the Voyage. We landed at a small Port-Town called <em>Xamoschi</em>,* situated on
            the <em>South-East</em> Part of <em>Japan</em>. The Town lies on the <em>Western</em> Part, where there is a
            narrow Streight, leading <em>Northward</em> into a long Arm of the Sea, upon the <em>North-West</em> Part of
            which, <em>Yedo</em>* the Metropolis stands. At landing, I</p>

            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>shewed the Custom-House Oﬃcers my Letter from the King of <em>Luggnagg</em> to his Imperial Majesty: They
            knew the Seal perfectly well; it was as broad as the Palm of my Hand. The Impression was, <em>A King lifting
                up a lame Beggar from the Earth</em>. The Magistrates of the Town hearing of my Letter, received me as a
            publick Minister; they pro-vided me with Carriages and Servants, and bore my Charges to <em>Yedo</em>, where
            I was admitted to an Audience, and delivered my Letter; which was opened with great Ceremony, and explained
            to the Emperor by an Interpreter, who then gave me Notice of his Majesty&rsquo;s Order, that I should
            signify my Request; and whatever it were, it should be granted for the sake of his Royal Brother of
            <em>Luggnagg</em>. This Inter-preter was a Person employed to transact Aﬀairs with the <em>Hollanders</em>:
            He soon conjectured by my Countenance that I was a <em>European</em>, and therefore repeated his
            Majesty&rsquo;s Commands in <em>Low-Dutch</em>,* which he spoke perfectly well. I answered, (as I had before
            determined) that I was a <em>Dutch</em> Merchant, shipwrecked in a very remote Country, from whence I
            travelled by Sea and Land to <em>Luggnagg</em>, and then took Shipping for <em>Japan</em>, where I knew my
            Countrymen often traded, and with some of these I hoped to get an Opportunity of returning into
            <em>Europe</em>: I therefore most humbly entreated his Royal Favour to give Order, that I should be
            conducted in Safety to <em>Nangasac</em>.* To this I added another Petition, that for the sake of my Patron
            the King of <em>Luggnagg</em>, his Majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the Ceremony imposed on
            my Countrymen, of <em>trampling upon the Cruci</em><em>fi</em><em>x</em>;* because I had been thrown into
            his Kingdom by my Misfortunes, without any Intention of trading. When this latter Peti-tion was interpreted
            to the Emperor, he seemed a little surprised; and said, he believed I was the first of my Countrymen who
            ever made any Scruple in this Point; and that he began to doubt whether I was a real <em>Hollander</em> or
            no; but rather suspected I must be a christian. However, for the Reasons I had oﬀered, but chiefly to
            gratify the King of <em>Luggnagg</em>, by an uncommon Mark of his Favour, he would comply with the
            <em>singularity</em> of my Humour; but the Aﬀair must be managed with Dexterity, and his Oﬃcers should be
            commanded to let me pass as it were by Forgetfulness. For he assured me, that if the Secret should be
            discovered by my Countrymen, the <em>Dutch</em>, they would cut my Throat in the Voyage. I returned my
            Thanks by the Interpreter for so unusual a Favour; and some Troops being at that Time on their March to
            <em>Nangasac</em>, the Commanding Oﬃcer had</p>

        <p>Orders to convey me safe thither, with particular Instructions about the Business of the
            <em>Cruci</em><em>fi</em><em>x</em>.</p>
        <p>On the 9th Day of <em>June</em>, 1709, I arrived at <em>Nangasac</em>, after a very long and troublesome
            Journey. I soon fell into the Company of some <em>Dutch</em> Sailors belonging to the <em>Amboyna</em>* of
            <em>Amsterdam</em>, a stout Ship of 450 Tuns. I had lived long in <em>Holland</em>, pursuing my Studies at
            <em>Leyden</em>, and I spoke <em>Dutch</em> well: The Seamen soon knew from whence I came last; they were
            curious to enquire into my Voyages and Course of Life. I made up a Story as short and probable as I could,
            but concealed the greatest Part. I knew many Persons in <em>Holland</em>; I was able to invent Names for my
            Parents, whom I pre-tended to be obscure People in the Province of <em>Guelderland</em>. I would have given
            the Captain (one <em>Theodorus Vangrult</em>*) what he pleased to ask for my Voyage to <em>Holland</em>;
            but, understanding I was a Surgeon, he was contented to take half the usual Rate, on Condition that I would
            serve him in the Way of my Calling. Before we took Shipping, I was often asked by some of the Crew, whether
            I had performed the Ceremony above-mentioned? I evaded the Question by general Answers, that I had satisfied
            the Emperor and Court in all Particulars. However, a malicious Rogue of a Skipper* went to an Oﬃcer, and
            pointing to me, told him, I had not yet <em>trampled on the Cruci</em><em>fi</em><em>x</em>: But the other,
            who had received Instructions to let me pass, gave the Rascal twenty Strokes on the Shoulders with a Bamboo;
            after which I was no more troubled with such Questions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nothing happened worth mentioning in this Voyage. We sailed with a fair Wind to the <em>Cape of Good
                Hope</em>, where we stayed only to take in fresh Water. On the 6th of <em>April</em> we arrived safe at
            <em>Amsterdam</em>, having lost only three Men by Sickness in the Voyage, and a fourth who fell from the
            Fore-mast into the Sea, not far from the Coast of <em>Guinea</em>. From <em>Amsterdam</em> I soon after set
            sail for <em>England</em> in a small Vessel belonging to that City.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the 10th of <em>April</em>, 1710, we put in at the <em>Downs</em>. I landed the next Morning, and saw once
            more my Native Country after an Absence of five Years and six Months compleat. I went straight to
            <em>Redri</em><em>ﬀ</em>, where I arrived the same Day at two in the Afternoon, and found my Wife and Family
            in good Health.</p>

                could have learned the Lesson of knowing when I was well. I left my poor Wife big with Child, and
                accepted an advantageous Oﬀer made me to be Captain of the <em>Adventure,</em>* a stout Merchant-man of
                350 Tuns: for I under-stood Navigation well, and being grown weary of a Surgeon&rsquo;s Employment at
                Sea, which however I could exercise upon Occasion,</li>
            <li>took a skilful young Man of that Calling, one <em>Robert Purefoy</em>, into my Ship. We set sail from
                <em>Portsmouth</em> upon the 7th Day of <em>September</em>, 1710; on the 14th we met with Captain
                <em>Pocock</em>* of <em>Bristol</em>, at <em>Tenari</em><em>ﬀ</em>, who was going to the Bay of
                <em>Campeachy</em>, to cut Logwood.* On the 16th he was parted from us by a Storm: I heard since my
                Return, that his Ship foundered, and none escaped, but one Cabbin-Boy. He was an honest Man, and a good
                Sailor, but a little too positive in his own Opinions,* which was the Cause of his Destruction, as it
                hath been of several others. For if he had followed my Advice, he might at this Time have been safe at
                home with his Family as well as my self.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had several Men died in my Ship of Calentures,* so that I was forced to get Recruits out of
            <em>Barbadoes</em>,* and the <em>Leeward Islands</em>, where I touched by the Direction of the Merchants who
            employed me; which I had soon too much Cause to repent; for I found after-wards that most of them had been
            Buccaneers. I had fifty Hands on Board; and my Orders were, that I should trade with the <em>Indians</em> in
            the <em>South-Sea</em>, and make what Discoveries I could. These Rogues whom I had picked up, debauched my
            other Men, and they all formed a Conspiracy to seize the Ship and secure me; which they did one Morning,
            rushing into my Cabbin, and binding me Hand and Foot, threatening to throw me overboard, if I oﬀered to
            stir. I told them, I was their Prisoner, and would submit. This they made</p>

        <p>me swear to do, and then unbound me, only fastening one of my Legs with a Chain near my Bed; and placed a
            Centry at my Door with his Piece* charged, who was commanded to shoot me dead if I attempted my Liberty.
            They sent me down Victuals and Drink, and took the Government of the Ship to themselves. Their Design was to
            turn Pirates, and plunder the <em>Spaniards</em>, which they could not do, till they got more Men. But first
            they resolved to sell the Goods in the Ship, and then go to <em>Madagascar</em>* for Recruits, several among
            them having died since my Confinement. They sailed many Weeks, and traded with the <em>Indians</em>; but I
            knew not what Course they took, being kept close Prisoner in my Cabbin, and expecting nothing less than to
            be murdered, as they often threatened me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Upon the 9th Day of <em>May</em>, 1711, one <em>James Welch</em> came down to my Cabbin; and said he had
            Orders from the Captain to set me ashore. I expostulated with him, but in vain; neither would he so much as
            tell me who their new Captain was. They forced me into the Long-boat, letting me put on my best Suit of
            Cloaths, which were as good as new, and a small Bundle of Linnen, but no Arms except my Hanger; and they
            were so civil as not to search my Pockets, into which I conveyed what Money I had, with some other little
            Necessaries. They rowed about a League; and then set me down on a Strand. I desired them to tell me what
            Country it was: They all swore, they knew no more than my self, but said, that the Captain (as they called
            him) was resolved, after they had sold the Lading, to get rid of me in the first Place where they discovered
            Land. They pushed oﬀ immediately, advising me to make haste, for fear of being overtaken by the Tide; and so
            bade me farewell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In this desolate Condition I advanced forward, and soon got upon firm Ground, where I sat down on a Bank to
            rest my self, and consider what I had best to do. When I was a little refreshed, I went up into the Country,
            resolving to deliver my self to the first Savages I should meet; and purchase my Life from them by some
            Bracelets, Glass Rings, and other Toys,* which Sailors usually provide them-selves with in those Voyages,
            and whereof I had some about me: The Land was divided by long Rows of Trees, not regularly planted, but
            naturally growing; there was great Plenty of Grass, and several Fields of Oats. I walked very circumspectly
            for fear of being surprised, or suddenly shot with an Arrow from behind, or on either Side. I fell into a
            beaten Road, where I saw many Tracks of human</p>

        <p>Feet, and some of Cows, but most of Horses. At last I beheld several Animals in a Field,* and one or two of
            the same Kind sitting in Trees. Their Shape was very singular, and deformed, which a little discomposed me,
            so that I lay down behind a Thicket to observe them better. Some of them coming forward near the Place where
            I lay, gave me an Opportunity of distinctly marking their Form. Their Heads and Breasts were covered with a
            thick Hair, some frizzled and others lank; they had Beards like Goats, and a Long Ridge of Hair down their
            Backs, and the fore Parts of their Legs and Feet; but the rest of their Bodies were bare, so that I might
            see their Skins, which were of a brown Buﬀ Colour. They had no Tails, nor any Hair at all on their Buttocks,
            except about the <em>Anus</em> ; which, I presume Nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the
            Ground; for this Posture they used, as well as lying down, and often stood on their hind Feet. They climbed
            high Trees, as nimbly as a Squirrel, for they had strong extended Claws before and behind, terminating in
            sharp Points, and hooked. They would often spring, and bound, and leap with prodigious Agility. The Females
            were not so large as the Males; they had long lank Hair on their Heads, and only a Sort of Down on the rest
            of their Bodies, except about the <em>Anus</em>, and <em>Pudenda.</em> Their Dugs hung between their fore
            Feet, and often reached almost to the Ground as they walked.* The Hair of both Sexes was of several Colours,
            brown, red, black and yellow. Upon the whole, I never beheld in all my Travels so disagreeable an Animal, or
            one against which I naturally conceived so strong an Antipathy. So that thinking I had seen enough, full of
            Contempt and Aversion, I got up and pursued the beaten Road, hoping it might direct me to the Cabbin of some
            <em>Indian.</em> I had not gone far when I met one of these Creatures full in my Way, and coming up directly
            to me. The ugly Monster, when he saw me, distorted several Ways every Feature of his Visage, and stared as
            at an Object he had never seen before; then approaching nearer, lifted up his fore Paw, whether out of
            Curiosity or Mischief, I could not tell: But I drew my Hanger, and gave him a good Blow with the flat Side
            of it; for I durst not strike him with the Edge, fearing the Inhabitants might be provoked against me, if
            they should come to know, that I had killed or maimed any of their Cattle.* When the Beast felt the Smart,
            he drew back, and roared so loud, that a Herd of at least forty came flocking about me from the next Field,
            howling and making odious Faces; but I ran to</p>

        <p>the Body of a Tree, and leaning my Back against it, kept them oﬀ, by waving my Hanger. Several of this cursed
            Brood getting hold of the Branches behind, leaped up into the Tree, from whence they began to discharge
            their Excrements on my Head:* However, I escaped pretty well, by sticking close to the Stem of the Tree, but
            was almost stifled with the Filth, which fell about me on every Side.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the Midst of this Distress, I observed them all to run away on a sudden as fast as they could; at which I
            ventured to leave the Tree, and pursue the Road, wondering what it was that could put them into this Fright.
            But looking on my Left-Hand, I saw a Horse walking softly in the Field; which my Persecutors having sooner
            discovered, was the Cause of their Flight. The Horse started a little when he came near me, but soon
            recovering himself, looked full in my Face with manifest Tokens of Wonder: He viewed my Hands and Feet,
            walking round me several times. I would have pursued my Journey, but he placed himself directly in the Way,
            yet looking with a very mild Aspect, never oﬀering the least Violence. We stood gazing at each other for
            some time; at last I took the Boldness to reach my Hand towards his Neck, with a Design to stroak it; using
            the common Style and Whistle of Jockies when they are going to handle a strange Horse. But, this Animal
            seeming to receive my Civilities with Disdain, shook his Head, and bent his Brows, softly raising up his
            Left Fore-Foot to remove my Hand. Then he neighed three or four times, but in so diﬀerent a Cadence, that I
            almost began to think he was speaking to himself in some Language of his own.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While He and I were thus employed, another Horse came up; who applying himself to the first in a very formal
            Manner, they gently struck each others Right Hoof before, neighing several times by Turns, and varying the
            Sound, which seemed to be almost articulate. They went some Paces oﬀ, as if it were to confer together,
            walking Side by Side, backward and forward, like Persons deliberating upon some Aﬀair of Weight; but often
            turning their Eyes towards me, as it were to watch that I might not escape. I was amazed to see such Actions
            and Behavior in Brute Beasts; and concluded with myself, that if the Inhabitants of this Country were endued
            with a pro-portionable Degree of Reason, they must needs be the wisest People upon Earth. This Thought gave
            me so much Comfort, that I resolved to go forward until I could discover some House or Village, or meet with
            any of the Natives; leaving the two Horses to discourse</p>

        <p>together as they pleased. But the first, who was a Dapple-Grey, observing me to steal oﬀ, neighed after me in
            so expressive a Tone, that I fancied myself to understand what he meant; whereupon I turned back, and came
            near him, to expect his farther Commands; but concealing my Fear as much as I could; for I began to be in
            some Pain, how this Adventure might terminate: and the Reader will easily believe I did not much like my
            present Situation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The two Horses came up close to me, looking with great Earnestness upon my Face and Hands. The grey Steed
            rubbed my Hat all round with his Right Fore-hoof, and discomposed it so much, that I was forced to adjust it
            better, by taking it oﬀ, and settling it again; whereat both he and his Companion (who was a brown Bay)
            appeared to be much surprized; the latter felt the Lappet of my Coat, and finding it to hang loose about me,
            they both looked with new Signs of Wonder. He stroked my Right Hand, seeming to admire the Softness, and
            Colour; but he squeezed it so hard between his Hoof and his Pastern, that I was forced to roar; after which
            they both touched me with all possible Tenderness. They were under great Perplexity about my Shoes and
            Stockings, which they felt very often, neighing to each other, and using various Gestures, not unlike those
            of a Philosopher, when he would attempt to solve some new and diﬃcult Ph&aelig;nomenon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Upon the whole, the Behaviour of these Animals was so orderly and rational, so acute and judicious, that I at
            last concluded, they must needs be Magicians, who had thus metamorphosed* themselves upon some Design; and
            seeing a Stranger in the Way, were resolved to divert themselves with him; or perhaps were really amazed at
            the Sight of a Man so very diﬀerent in Habit, Feature and Complexion from those who might probably live in
            so remote a Climate. Upon the Strength of this Reasoning, I ventured to address them in the following
            Manner: Gentlemen, if you be Conjurers, as I have good Cause to believe, you can understand any Language;
            therefore I make bold to let your Worships know, that I am a poor distressed <em>Englishman</em>, driven by
            his Misfortunes upon your Coast; and I entreat one of you, to let me ride upon his Back, as if he were a
            real Horse, to some House or Village, where I can be relieved. In return of which Favour, I will make you a
            Present of this Knife and Bracelet, (taking them out of my Pocket.) The two Creatures stood silent while I
            spoke, seeming to listen with great Attention; and when I had</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>212&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>ended, they neighed frequently towards each other, as if they were engaged in serious Conversation. I plainly
            observed, that their Language expressed the Passions* very well, and the Words might with little Pains be
            resolved into an Alphabet more easily than the <em>Chinese</em>.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I could frequently distinguish the Word <em>Yahoo</em>, which was repeated by each of them several times; and
            although it were impossible for me to conjecture what it meant, yet while the two Horses were busy in
            Conversation, I endeavoured to practice this Word upon my Tongue; and as soon as they were silent, I boldly
            pronounced <em>Yahoo</em> in a loud Voice, imitating, at the same time, as near as I could, the Neighing of
            a Horse; at which they were both visibly surprized,* and the Grey repeated the same Word twice, as if he
            meant to teach me the right Accent, wherein I spoke after him as well as I could, and found myself
            perceivably to improve every time, although very far from any Degree of Perfection. Then the Bay tried me
            with a second Word, much harder to be pronounced; but reducing it to the <em>English Orthography</em>, may
            be spelt thus, <em>Houyhnhnm.</em> I did not succeed in this so well as the former, but after two or three
            farther Trials, I had better Fortune; and they both appeared amazed at my Capacity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After some farther Discourse, which I then conjectured might relate to me, the two Friends took their Leaves,
            with the same Compliment of striking each other&rsquo;s Hoof; and the Grey made me Signs that I should walk
            before him; wherein I thought it prudent to comply, till I could find a better Director. When I oﬀered to
            slacken my Pace, he would cry <em>Hhuun</em>, <em>Hhuun</em>; I guessed his Meaning, and gave him to
            understand, as well as I could, that I was weary, and not able to walk faster; upon which, he would stand a
            while to let me rest.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>H av i n g travelled about three Miles, we came to a long Kind of Building, made of Timber, stuck in the
            Ground, and wattled a-cross; the Roof was low, and covered with Straw. I now began to be a little comforted;
            and took out some Toys, which Travellers usually carry for Presents to the Savage <em>Indians</em> of
            <em>America</em> and other Parts, in hopes the People of the House would be thereby encouraged to receive me
            kindly. The Horse made me a Sign to go in first; it was a large Room with a smooth Clay Floor, and a Rack
            and Manger extending the whole Length on one Side. There were three Nags, and two Mares, not eating, but
            some of them sitting down upon their Hams, which I very much wondered at; but wondered more to see the rest
            employed in domestick Business: The last seemed but ordinary Cattle; however this confirmed my first
            Opinion, that a People who could so far civilize brute Animals, must needs excel in Wisdom all the Nations
            of the World. The Grey came in just after, and thereby prevented any ill Treatment, which the others might
            have given me. He neighed to them several times in a Style of Authority, and received Answers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beyond this Room there were three others, reaching the Length of the House, to which you passed through three
            Doors, opposite to each other, in the Manner of a Vista: We went through the second Room towards the third;
            here the Grey walked in first, beckoning me to attend: I waited in the second Room, and got ready my
            Presents, for the Master and Mistress of the House: They were two Knives, three Bracelets of false Pearl, a
            small Looking Glass and a Bead Necklace. The Horse neighed three or four Times, and I waited to hear some
            Answers in a human Voice, but I heard no other Returns than in the same Dialect, only one or two a little
            shriller than his. I began to think that this House must belong to some Person of great Note among them,
            because there appeared so much ceremony before</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>214&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I could gain Admittance. But, that a Man of Quality should be served all by Horses, was beyond my
            Comprehension. I feared my Brain was disturbed by my Suﬀerings and Misfortunes: I roused my self, and looked
            about me in the Room where I was left alone; this was furnished as the first, only after a more elegant
            Manner. I rubbed mine Eyes often, but the same Objects still occurred. I pinched my Arms and Sides, to awake
            my self, hoping I might be in a Dream. I then absolutely concluded, that all these Appearances could be
            nothing else but Necromancy and Magick. But I had no Time to pursue these Reflections; for the Grey Horse
            came to the Door, and made me a Sign to follow him into the third Room; where I saw a very comely Mare,
            together with a Colt and Fole, sitting on their Haunches, upon Mats of Straw, not unartfully made, and
            perfectly neat and clean.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Mare soon after my Entrance, rose from her Mat, and coming up close, after having nicely observed my
            Hands and Face, gave me a most contemptuous Look; then turning to the Horse, I heard the Word <em>Yahoo</em>
            often repeated betwixt them; the meaning of which Word I could not then comprehend, although it were the
            first I had learned to pronounce; but I was soon better informed, to my ever-lasting Mortification: For the
            Horse beckoning to me with his Head, and repeating the Word <em>Hhuun</em>, <em>Hhuun</em>, as he did upon
            the Road, which I understood was to attend him, led me out into a kind of Court, where was another Building
            at some Distance from the House. Here we entered, and I saw three of those detestable Crea-tures, which I
            first met after my landing, feeding upon Roots, and the Flesh of some Animals, which I afterwards found to
            be that of Asses and Dogs, and now and then a Cow dead by Accident or Disease.* They were all tied by the
            Neck with strong Wyths,* fastened to a Beam; they held their Food between the Claws of their fore Feet, and
            tore it with their Teeth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Master Horse ordered a Sorrel Nag, one of his Servants, to untie the largest of these Animals, and take
            him into the Yard. The Beast and I were brought close together; and our Countenances diligently compared,
            both by Master and Servant, who thereupon repeated several Times the Word <em>Yahoo.</em> My Horror and
            Astonish-ment are not to be described, when I observed, in this abominable Animal, a perfect human Figure;
            the Face of it indeed was flat and broad, the Nose depressed, the Lips large, and the Mouth wide: But</p>

        <p>these Diﬀerences are common to all savage Nations, where the Lineaments of the Countenance are distorted by
            the Natives suﬀering their Infants to lie grovelling on the Earth, or by carrying them on their Backs,
            nuzzling with their Face against the Mother&rsquo;s Shoulders. The Fore-feet of the <em>Yahoo</em> diﬀered
            from my Hands in nothing else, but the Length of the Nails, the Coarseness and Brownness of the Palms, and
            the Hairiness on the Backs. There was the same Resemblance between our Feet, with the same Diﬀerences, which
            I knew very well, although the Horses did not, because of my Shoes and Stockings; the same in every Part of
            our Bodies, except as to Hairiness and Colour, which I have already described.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The great Diﬃculty that seemed to stick with the two Horses, was, to see the rest of my Body so very diﬀerent
            from that of a <em>Yahoo</em>, for which I was obliged to my Cloaths, whereof they had no Conception:* The
            Sorrel Nag oﬀered me a Root, which he held (after their Manner, as we shall describe in its proper Place)
            between his Hoof and Pastern; I took it in my Hand, and having smelt it, returned it to him again as civilly
            as I could. He brought out of the <em>Yahoo</em>&rsquo;s Kennel a Piece of Ass&rsquo;s Flesh, but it smelt
            so oﬀensively that I turned from it with loathing; he then threw it to the <em>Yahoo</em>, by whom it was
            greedily devoured. He afterwards shewed me a Wisp of Hay, and a Fettlock full of Oats; but I shook my Head,
            to signify, that neither of these were Food for me. And indeed, I now apprehended, that I must absolutely
            starve, if I did not get to some of my own Species: For as to those filthy <em>Yahoos</em>, although there
            were few greater Lovers of Mankind, at that time, than myself; yet I confess I never saw any sensitive Being
            so detestable on all Accounts; and the more I came near them, the more hateful they grew, while I stayed in
            that Country. This the Master Horse observed by my Behaviour, and therefore sent the <em>Yahoo</em> back to
            his Kennel. He then put his Fore-hoof to his Mouth, at which I was much surprized, although he did it with
            Ease, and with a Motion that appear&rsquo;d perfectly natural; and made other Signs to know what I would
            eat; but I could not return him such an Answer as he was able to apprehend; and if he had understood me I
            did not see how it was possible to contrive any way for finding myself Nourishment. While we were thus
            engaged, I observed a Cow passing by; whereupon I pointed to her, and expressed a Desire to let me go and
            milk her. This had its Eﬀect; for he led me back into the House, and ordered a Mare-servant to open a</p>

        <p>Room, where a good Store of Milk lay in Earthen and Wooden Vessels, after a very orderly and cleanly Manner.
            She gave me a large Bowl full, of which I drank very heartily, and found myself well refreshed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About Noon I saw coming towards the House a Kind of Vehicle, drawn like a Sledge* by four <em>Yahoos.</em>
            There was in it an old Steed,* who seemed to be of Quality; he alighted with his Hind-feet forward, having
            by Accident got a Hurt in his Left Fore-foot. He came to dine with our Horse, who received him with great
            Civility. They dined in the best Room, and had Oats boiled in Milk for the second Course, which the old
            Horse eat warm, but the rest cold. Their Mangers were placed circular in the Middle of the Room, and divided
            into several Partitions, round which they sat on their Haunches upon Bosses of Straw. In the Middle was a
            large Rack with Angles answering to every Partition of the Manger. So that each Horse and Mare eat their own
            Hay, and their own Mash of Oats and Milk, with much Decency and Regularity. The Behaviour of the young Colt
            and Foal appeared very modest; and that of the Master and Mistress extremely chearful and complaisant* to
            their Guest. The Grey ordered me to stand by him; and much Discourse passed between him and his Friend
            concerning me, as I found by the Stranger&rsquo;s often looking on me, and the frequent Repetition of the
            Word <em>Yahoo.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I happened to wear my Gloves; which the Master Grey observing, seemed perplexed; discovering Signs of Wonder
            what I had done to my Fore-feet; he put his Hoof three or four times to them, as if he would signify, that I
            should reduce them to their former Shape, which I presently did, pulling oﬀ both my Gloves, and putting them
            into my Pocket. This occasioned farther Talk, and I saw the Company was pleased with my Behaviour, whereof I
            soon found the good Eﬀects. I was ordered to speak the few Words I understood; and while they were at
            Dinner, the Master taught me the Names for Oats, Milk, Fire, Water, and some others; which I could readily
            pronounce after him; having from my Youth a great Facility in learning Languages.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Dinner was done, the Master Horse took me aside, and by Signs and Words made me understand the Concern
            he was in, that I had nothing to eat. Oats in their Tongue are called <em>Hlunnh.</em> This Word I
            pronounced two or three times; for although I had refused them at first, yet upon second Thoughts, I
            considered that I could</p>

        <p>contrive to make of them a Kind of Bread, which might be suﬃcient with Milk to keep me alive, till I could
            make my Escape to some other Country, and to Creatures of my own Species. The Horse immediately ordered a
            white Mare-servant of his Family to bring me a good Quantity of Oats in a Sort of wooden Tray. These I
            heated before the Fire as well as I could, and rubbed them till the Husks came oﬀ, which I made a shift to
            winnow from the Grain; I ground and beat them between two Stones, then took Water, and made them into a
            Paste or Cake, which I toasted at the Fire, and eat warm with Milk. It was at first a very insipid Diet,
            although common enough in many Parts of <em>Europe</em>, but grew tolerable by Time; and having been often
            reduced to hard Fare in my Life, this was not the first Experiment I had made how easily Nature is
            satisfied.* And I cannot but observe, that I never had one Hour&rsquo;s Sickness, while I staid in this
            Island. It is true, I sometimes made a shift to catch a Rabbet, or Bird, by Springes made of <em>Yahoos</em>
            Hairs; and I often gathered whole-some Herbs, which I boiled, or eat as Salades with my Bread; and now and
            then, for a Rarity, I made a little Butter, and drank the Whey. I was at first at a great Loss for Salt; but
            Custom soon recon-ciled the Want of it; and I am confident that the frequent Use of Salt among us is an
            Eﬀect of Luxury, and was first introduced only as a Provocative to Drink; except where it is necessary for
            preserving of Flesh in long Voyages, or in Places remote from great Markets. For we observe no Animal to be
            fond of it but Man:* And as to myself, when I left this Country, it was a great while before I could endure
            the Taste of it in any thing that I eat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is enough to say upon the Subject of my Dyet, wherewith other Travellers fill their Books, as if the
            Readers were personally concerned, whether we fare* well or ill. However, it was necessary to mention this
            Matter, lest the World should think it impossible that I could find Sustenance for three Years in such a
            Country, and among such Inhabitants.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When it grew towards Evening, the Master Horse ordered a Place for me to lodge in; it was but Six Yards from
            the House, and separ-ated from the Stable of the <em>Yahoos.</em> Here I got some Straw, and covering myself
            with my own Cloaths, slept very sound. But I was in a short time better accommodated, as the Reader shall
            know hereafter, when I come to treat more particularly about my Way of living.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>M y principal Endeavour was to learn the Language, which my Master* (for so I shall henceforth call him) and
            his Children, and every Servant of his House were desirous to teach me. For they looked upon it as a
            Prodigy, that a brute Animal should discover such Marks of a rational Creature. I pointed to every thing,
            and enquired the Name of it, which I wrote down in my <em>Journal Book</em> when I was alone, and corrected
            my bad Accent, by desiring those of the Family to pronounce it often. In this Employment, a Sorrel Nag, one
            of the under Servants, was very ready to assist me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In speaking, they pronounce through the Nose and Throat, and their Language approaches nearest to the
            <em>High Dutch</em> or <em>German</em>, of any I know in <em>Europe</em> ; but is much more graceful and
            significant. The Emperor <em>Charles</em> V. made almost the same Observation* when he said, That if he were
            to speak to his Horse, it should be in <em>High Dutch</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Curiosity and Impatience of my Master were so great, that he spent many Hours of his Leisure to instruct
            me. He was convinced (as he afterwards told me) that I must be a <em>Yahoo</em>, but my Teachable-ness,
            Civility and Cleanliness astonished him; which were Qualities altogether so opposite to those Animals. He
            was most perplexed about my Cloaths, reasoning sometimes with himself, whether they were a Part of my Body;
            for I never pulled them oﬀ till the Family were asleep, and got them on before they waked in the Morning. My
            Master was eager to learn from whence I came; how I acquired those Appearances of Reason, which I discovered
            in all my Actions; and to know my Story from my own Mouth, which he hoped he should soon do by the great
            Proficiency I made in learning and pronouncing their Words and Sentences. To help my Memory, I formed all I
            learned into the <em>English</em> Alphabet, and writ the Words down with the Translations. This last, after
            some time, I ventured to do in my</p>

        <p>Master&rsquo;s Presence. It cost me much Trouble to explain to him what I was doing; for the Inhabitants have
            not the least Idea of Books or Literature.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In about ten Weeks time I was able to understand most of his Questions; and in three Months could give him
            some tolerable Answers. He was extremely curious to know from what Part of the Country I came, and how I was
            taught to imitate a rational Creature; because the <em>Yahoos</em>, (whom he saw I exactly resembled in my
            Head, Hands and Face, that were only visible,) with some Appearance of Cunning, and the strongest
            Disposition to Mischief, were observed to be the most unteachable of all Brutes. I answered; that I came
            over the Sea, from a far Place, with many others of my own Kind, in a great hollow Vessel made of the Bodies
            of Trees: That, my Companions forced me to land on this Coast, and then left me to shift for myself. It was
            with some Diﬃculty, and by the Help of many Signs, that I brought him to understand me. He replied, that I
            must needs be mistaken, or that I <em>said the thing which was not.</em> (For they have no Word in their
            Language to express Lying or Falshood.) He knew it was impossible* that there could be a Country beyond the
            Sea, or that a Parcel of Brutes could move a wooden Vessel whither they pleased upon Water. He was sure no
            <em>Houyhnhnm</em> alive could make such a Vessel, or would trust <em>Yahoos</em> to manage it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Word <em>Houyhnhnm</em>, in their Tongue, signifies a <em>Horse</em>; and in its Etymology, <em>the
                Perfection of Nature.</em>* I told my Master, that I was at a Loss for Expression, but would improve as
            fast as I could; and hoped in a short time I would be able to tell him Wonders: He was pleased to direct his
            own Mare, his Colt and Fole, and the Servants of the Family, to take all Opportunities of instructing me;
            and every Day for two or three Hours, he was at the same Pains himself: Several Horses and Mares of Quality
            in the Neighbourhood came often to our House, upon the Report spread of a wonderful <em>Yahoo</em>, that
            could speak like a <em>Houyhnhnm</em>, and seemed in his Words and Actions to discover some Glimmerings of
            Reason. These delighted to converse with me; they put many Questions, and received such Answers, as I was
            able to return. By all which Advantages, I made so great a Progress, that in five Months from my Arrival, I
            understood whatever was spoke, and could express myself tolerably well.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The <em>Houyhnhnms</em> who came to visit my Master, out of a Design of seeing and talking with me, could
            hardly believe me to be a right*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>220&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p><em>Yahoo</em>, because my Body had a diﬀerent Covering from others of my Kind. They were astonished to
            observe me without the usual Hair or Skin, except on my Head, Face and Hands: but I discovered that Secret
            to my Master, upon an Accident, which happened about a Fortnight before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have already told the Reader, that every Night when the Family were gone to Bed, it was my Custom to strip
            and cover myself with my Cloaths: It happened one Morning early, that my Master sent for me, by the Sorrel
            Nag, who was his Valet; when he came, I was fast asleep, my Cloaths fallen oﬀ on one Side, and my Shirt
            above my Waste. I awaked at the Noise he made, and observed him to deliver his Message in some Disorder;
            after which he went to my Master, and in a great Fright gave him a very confused Account of what he had
            seen: This I presently discovered; for going as soon as I was dressed, to pay my Attendance upon his Honour,
            he asked me the Meaning of what his Servant had reported; that I was not the same Thing when I slept as I
            appeared to be at other times; that his Valet assured him, some Part of me was white, some yellow, at least
            not so white, and some brown.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had hitherto concealed the Secret of my Dress, in order to distinguish myself as much as possible, from
            that cursed Race of <em>Yahoos</em>; but now I found it in vain to do so any longer. Besides, I considered
            that my Cloaths and Shoes would soon wear out, which already were in a declining Condition, and must be
            supplied by some Contrivance from the Hides of <em>Yahoos</em>*, or other Brutes; whereby the whole Secret
            would be known. I therefore told my Master, that in the Country from whence I came, those of my Kind always
            covered their Bodies with the Hairs of certain Animals prepared by Art, as well for Decency, as to avoid
            Inclemencies of Air both hot and cold; of which, as to my own Person I would give him immediate Conviction,
            if he pleased to command me; only desiring his Excuse, if I did not expose those Parts that Nature taught us
            to conceal. He said, my Discourse was all very strange, but especially the last Part; for he could not
            understand why Nature should teach us to conceal what Nature had given.* That neither himself nor Family
            were ashamed of any Parts of their Bodies; but however I might do as I pleased. Whereupon I first unbuttoned
            my Coat, and pulled it oﬀ. I did the same with my Wastecoat; I drew oﬀ my Shoes, Stockings and Breeches. I
            let my Shirt down to my Waste,</p>

        <p>and drew up the Bottom, fastening it like a Girdle about my Middle to hide my Nakedness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Master observed the whole Performance with great Signs of Curiosity and Admiration. He took up all my
            Cloaths in his Pastern, one Piece after another, and examined them diligently; he then stroaked my Body very
            gently, and looked round me several Times; after which he said, it was plain I must be a perfect
            <em>Yahoo</em>; but that I diﬀered very much from the rest of my Species, in the Whiteness, and Smoothness
            of my Skin, my want of Hair in several Parts of my Body, the Shape and Shortness of my Claws behind and
            before, and my Aﬀectation of walking continually on my two hinder Feet. He desired to see no more; and gave
            me leave to put on my Cloaths again, for I was shuddering with Cold.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I expressed my Uneasiness at his giving me so often the Appellation of <em>Yahoo</em>, an odious Animal, for
            which I had so utter an Hatred and Contempt. I begged he would forbear applying that Word to me, and take
            the same Order in his Family, and among his Friends whom he suﬀered to see me. I requested likewise, that
            the Secret of my having a false Covering to my Body might be known to none but himself, at least as long as
            my present Cloathing should last: For as to what the Sorrel Nag his Valet had observed, his Honour might
            command him to conceal it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All this my Master very graciously consented to;* and thus the Secret was kept till my Cloaths began to wear
            out, which I was forced to supply by several Contrivances, that shall hereafter be mentioned. In the mean
            Time, he desired I would go on with my utmost Diligence to learn their Language, because he was more
            astonished at my Capacity for Speech and Reason, than at the Figure of my Body, whether it were covered or
            no; adding, that he waited with some Impatience to hear the Wonders which I promised to tell him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From thenceforward he doubled the Pains he had been at to instruct me; he brought me into all Company, and
            made them treat me with Civility, because, as he told them privately, this would put me into good Humour,
            and make me more diverting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Every Day when I waited on him, beside the Trouble he was at in teaching, he would ask me several Questions
            concerning my self, which I answered as well as I could; and by those Means he had already received some
            general Ideas, although very imperfect. It would be tedious to relate the several Steps, by which I advanced
            to a</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>more regular Conversation: But the first Account I gave of my self in any Order and Length, was to this
            Purpose:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That, I came from a very far Country, as I already had attempted to tell him, with about fifty more of my own
            Species; that we travelled upon the Seas, in a great hollow Vessel made of Wood, and larger than his
            Honour&rsquo;s House. I described the Ship to him in the best Terms I could; and explained by the Help of my
            Handkerchief displayed, how it was driven forward by the Wind. That, upon a Quarrel among us, I was set on
            Shoar on this Coast, where I walked forward without knowing whither, till he delivered me from the
            Persecution of those execrable <em>Yahoos.</em> He asked me, Who made the Ship, and how it was possible that
            the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> of my Country would leave it to the Management of Brutes? My Answer was, that I
            durst proceed no farther in my Relation, unless he would give me his Word and Honour that he would not be
            oﬀended; and then I would tell him the Wonders I had so often promised. He agreed; and I went on by assuring
            him, that the Ship was made by Creatures like myself, who in all the Countries I had travelled, as well as
            in my own, were the only governing, rational Animals; and that upon my Arrival hither, I was as much
            astonished to see the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> act like rational Beings, as he or his friends could be in finding
            some Marks of Reason in a Creature he was pleased to call a <em>Yahoo</em>; to which I owned my Resemblance
            in every Part, but could not account for their degenerate and brutal Nature. I said farther, That if good
            Fortune ever restored me to my native Country, to relate my Travels hither, as I resolved to do; every Body
            would believe that I <em>said the Thing which was not</em>; that I invented the Story out of my own Head:
            And with all possible respect to Himself, his Family, and Friends, and under his Promise of not being
            oﬀended, our Countrymen would hardly think it probable, that a <em>Houyhnhnm</em> should be the presiding
            Creature of a Nation, and a <em>Yahoo</em> the brute.</p>

                by his Master. The Author gives a more particular Account of himself, and the Accidents of his
                Voyage.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>M y Master heard me with great Appearances of Uneasiness in his Countenance; because <em>Doubting</em> or
            <em>not believing</em>, are so little known in this Country, that the Inhabitants cannot tell how to behave
            themselves under such Circumstances. And I remember in frequent Discourses with my Master concerning the
            Nature of Manhood,* in other Parts of the World; having Occasion to talk of <em>Lying</em>, and <em>false
                Representation</em>, it was with much Diﬃculty that he comprehended what I meant; although he had
            otherwise a most acute Judgment. For he argued thus; That the Use of Speech was to make us understand one
            another, and to receive Information of Facts; now if any one <em>said the Thing which was not</em>, these
            Ends were defeated; because I cannot properly be said to understand him; and I am so far from receiving
            Information, that he leaves me worse than in Ignorance; for I am led to believe a Thing <em>Black</em> when
            it is <em>White</em>, and <em>Short</em> when it is <em>Long.</em> And these were all the Notions he had
            concerning that Faculty of <em>Lying</em>, so perfectly well understood, and so universally practised among
            human Creatures.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To return from this Digression; when I asserted that the <em>Yahoos</em> were the only governing Animals in
            my Country, which my Master said was altogether past his Conception, he desired to know, whether we had
            <em>Houyhnhnms</em> among us, and what was their Employment: I told him, we had great Numbers; that in
            Summer they grazed in the Fields, and in Winter were kept in Houses, with Hay and Oats, where
            <em>Yahoo</em>-Servants were employed to rub their Skins smooth, comb their Manes, pick their Feet, serve
            them with Food, and make their Beds. I understand you well, said my Master; it is now very plain from all
            you have spoken, that whatever Share of Reason the <em>Yahoos</em> pretend to, the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> are
            your Masters; I heartily wish our <em>Yahoos</em> would be so tractable. I begged his Honour would please to
            excuse me from proceeding any farther, because I was very certain that the Account he expected from me would
            be highly displeasing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>224&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he insisted in commanding me to let him know the best and the worst: I told him he should be obeyed. I
            owned, that the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> among us, whom we called <em>Horses</em>, were the most generous and
            comely Animal we had; that they excelled in Strength and Swiftness; and when they belonged to Persons of
            Quality, employed in Travelling, Racing, and drawing Chariots, they were treated with much Kindness and
            Care, till they fell into Diseases, or became foundered in the Feet; but then they were sold, and used to
            all kind of Drudgery till they died; after which their Skins were stripped and sold for what they were
            worth, and their Bodies left to be devoured by Dogs and Birds of Prey.* But the common Race of Horses had
            not so good Fortune, being kept by Farmers and Carriers, and other mean People, who put them to great
            Labour, and feed them worse. I described as well as I could, our Way of Riding; the Shape and Use of a
            Bridle, a Saddle, a Spur, and a Whip; of Harness and Wheels. I added, that we fastened Plates of a certain
            hard Substance called <em>Iron</em> at the Bottom of their Feet, to preserve their Hoofs from being broken
            by the Stony Ways on which we often travelled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Master, after some Expressions of great Indignation, wondered how we dared to venture upon a
            <em>Houyhnhnm</em>&rsquo;s Back; for he was sure, that the weakest Servant in his House would be able to
            shake oﬀ the strongest <em>Yahoo</em>; or by lying down, and rolling upon his Back, squeeze the Brute to
            Death. I answered, That our Horses were trained up from three or four Years old to the several Uses we
            intended them for; That if any of them proved intolerably vicious, they were employed for Carriages; that
            they were severely beaten while they were young for any mischievous Tricks: That the Males, designed for the
            common Use of Riding or Draught, were generally <em>castrated</em> about two Years after their Birth, to
            take down their Spirits, and make them more tame and gentle: That they were indeed sensible of Rewards and
            Punishments; but his Honour would please to consider, that they had not the least Tincture of Reason any
            more than the <em>Yahoos</em> in this Country.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It put me to the Pains of many Circumlocutions to give my Master a right Idea of what I spoke; for their
            Language doth not abound in Variety of Words, because their Wants and Passions are fewer* than among us. But
            it is impossible to express his noble Resentment at our savage Treatment of the <em>Houyhnhnm</em> Race;*
            particularly after I had explained the Manner and Use of <em>Castrating</em> Horses among us, to</p>

        <p>hinder them from propagating their Kind, and to render them more servile. He said, if it were possible there
            could be any Country where <em>Yahoos</em> alone were endued with Reason, they certainly must be the
            governing Animal, because Reason will in Time always prevail against Brutal Strength. But, considering the
            Frame of our Bodies, and especially of mine, he thought no Creature of equal Bulk was so ill-contrived, for
            employing that Reason in the common Oﬃces of Life; whereupon he desired to know whether those among whom I
            lived, resembled me or the <em>Yahoos</em> of his Country. I assured him, that I was as well shaped as most
            of my Age; but the younger and the Females were much more soft and tender, and the Skins of the latter
            generally as white as Milk. He said, I diﬀered indeed from other <em>Yahoos</em>, being much more cleanly,
            and not altogether so deformed; but in point of real Advantage, he thought I diﬀered for the worse. That my
            Nails were of no Use either to my fore or hinder Feet: As to my fore Feet, he could not properly call them
            by that Name, for he never observed me to walk upon them; that they were too soft to bear the Ground; that I
            generally went with them uncovered, neither was the Covering I sometimes wore on them, of the same Shape or
            so strong as that on my Feet behind. That I could not walk with any Security; for if either of my hinder
            Feet slipped, I must inevitably fall. He then began to find fault with other Parts of my Body; the Flatness
            of my Face, the Prominence of my Nose, mine Eyes placed directly in Front, so that I could not look on
            either Side without turning my Head: That I was not able to feed my self, without lifting one of my fore
            Feet to my Mouth: And therefore Nature had placed those Joints to answer that Necessity. He knew not what
            could be the Use of these several Clefts and Divisions in my Feet behind; that these were too soft to bear
            the Hardness and Sharpness of Stone without a Covering made from the Skin of some other Brute; that my whole
            Body wanted a Fence against Heat and Cold, which I was forced to put on and oﬀ every Day with Tediousness
            and Trouble. And lastly, that he observed every Animal in this Country naturally to abhor the
            <em>Yahoos</em>, whom the Weaker avoided, and the Stronger drove from them. So that supposing us to have the
            Gift of Reason, he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural Antipathy which every Creature
            discovered against us; nor consequently, how we could tame and render them serviceable. However, he would
            (as he said) debate the Matter no farther, because he was more desirous</p>

            came hither.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I assured him, how extreamly desirous I was that he should be satisfied on every Point; but I doubted much,
            whether it would be possible for me to explain my self on several Subjects whereof his Honour could have no
            Conception, because I saw nothing in his Country to which I could resemble them. That however, I would do my
            best, and strive to express my self by Similitudes, humbly desiring his Assistance when I wanted proper
            Words; which he was pleased to promise me.</p>

        <p>I said, my Birth was of honest Parents, in an Island called <em>England</em>, which was remote from this
            Country, as many Days Journey as the strongest of his Honour&rsquo;s Servants could travel in the Annual
            Course of the Sun. That I was bred a Surgeon, whose Trade it is to cure Wounds and Hurts in the Body, got by
            Accident or Violence. That my Country was governed by a Female Man, whom we called a <em>Queen.</em> That I
            left it to get Riches, whereby I might maintain my self and Family when I should return. That in my last
            Voyage, I was Commander of the Ship and had about fifty <em>Yahoos</em> under me, many of which died at Sea,
            and I was forced to supply them by others picked out from several Nations. That our Ship was twice in Danger
            of being sunk; the first Time by a great Storm, and the second, by striking against a Rock. Here my Master
            interposed, by asking me, How I could persuade Strangers out of diﬀerent Countries to venture with me, after
            the Losses I had sustained, and the Hazards I had run. I said, they were Fellows of desperate Fortunes,
            forced to fly from the Places of their Birth, on Account of their Poverty or their Crimes. Some were undone
            by Law-suits; others spent all they had in Drinking, Whoring and Gaming; others fled for Treason; many for
            Murder, Theft, Poysoning, Robbery, Perjury, Forgery, Coining false Money; for committing Rapes or Sodomy;
            for flying from their Colours,* or deserting to the Enemy; and most of them had broken Prison. None of these
            durst return to their native Countries for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a Jail; and therefore
            were under a Necessity of seeking a Livelihood in other Places.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During this Discourse, my Master was pleased often to interrupt me. I had made Use of many Circumlocutions in
            describing to him the Nature of the several Crimes, for which most of our Crew had</p>

        <p>been forced to fly their Country. This Labour took up several Days Conversation before he was able to
            comprehend me. He was wholly at a Loss to know what could be the Use or Necessity of practising those Vices.
            To clear up which I endeavored to give him some Ideas of the Desire of Power and Riches; of the terrible
            Eﬀects of Lust, Intemperance, Malice, and Envy. All this I was forced to define and describe by putting of
            Cases, and making Suppositions. After which, like one whose Imagination was struck with something never seen
            or heard of before, he would lift up his Eyes with Amazement and Indignation. Power, Government, War, Law,
            Punishment, and a Thousand other Things had no Terms, wherein that Language could express them; which made
            the Diﬃculty almost insuperable to give my Master any Conception of what I meant: But being of an excellent
            Understanding, much improved by Contemplation and Converse, he at last arrived at a competent Knowledge of
            what human Nature in our Parts of the World is capable to perform; and desired I would give him some
            particular Account of that Land, which we call <em>Europe</em>, especially, of my own Country.</p>

        <p><em>The Author at his Master</em>&rsquo;<em>s Commands informs him of the State of</em> England.<em> The
                Causes of War among the Princes of</em> Europe. <em>The Author begins to explain the</em> English
            <em>Constitution.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h e Reader may please to observe, that the following Extract of many Conversations I had with my Master,
            contains a Summary of the most material Points, which were discoursed at several times for above two Years;
            his Honour often desiring fuller Satisfaction as I farther improved in the <em>Houyhnhnm</em> Tongue. I laid
            before him, as well as I could, the whole State of <em>Europe</em>; I discoursed of Trade and Manufactures,
            of Arts and Sciences; and the Answers I gave to all the Questions he made, as they arose upon several
            Subjects, were a Fund of Conversation not to be exhausted. But I shall here only set down the Substance of
            what passed between us concerning my own Country, reducing it into Order as well as I can, without any
            Regard to Time or other Circumstances, while I strictly adhere to Truth. My only Concern is, that I shall
            hardly be able to do Justice to my Master&rsquo;s Arguments and Expressions, which must needs suﬀer by my
            Want of Capacity, as well as by a Translation into our barbarous <em>English.</em>*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In Obedience therefore to his Honour&rsquo;s Commands, I related to him the <em>Revolution</em>* under the
            Prince of <em>Orange</em>; the long War* with <em>France</em> entered into by the said Prince, and renewed
            by his Successor the present Queen; wherein the greatest Powers of <em>Christendom</em> were engaged, and
            which still continued: I computed at his Request, that about a Million of <em>Yahoos</em> might have been
            killed in the whole Progress of it; and perhaps a Hundred or more Cities taken, and five times as many Ships
            burnt or sunk.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He asked me what were the usual Causes or Motives that made one Country go to War with another. I answered,
            they were innumerable; but I should only mention a few of the chief. Some-times the Ambition of Princes, who
            never think they have Land or People enough to govern:* Sometimes the Corruption of Ministers, who engage
            their Master in a War in order to stifle or divert the Clamour of the Subjects against their evil
            Administration. Diﬀerence</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Berry</em> be <em>Blood</em> or <em>Wine</em>: Whether <em>Whistling</em> be a Vice or a Virtue:*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whether it be better to <em>kiss a Post</em>,* or throw it into the Fire: What is the best colour for a
            <em>Coat</em>,* whether <em>Black</em>, <em>White</em>, <em>Red</em>, or <em>Grey</em>; and whether it
            should be <em>long</em> or <em>short</em>, <em>narrow</em> or <em>wide</em>, <em>dirty</em> or
            <em>clean</em>; with many more. Neither are any Wars so furious and bloody, or of so long Continuance, as
            those occasioned by Diﬀerence in Opinion, especially if it be in things indiﬀerent.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes the Quarrel between two Princes is to decide which of them shall dispossess a Third of his
            Dominions, where neither of them pretend to any Right.* Sometimes one Prince quarrelleth with another, for
            fear the other should quarrel with him. Sometimes a War is entered upon, because the Enemy is too
            <em>strong</em>, and sometimes because he is too <em>weak.</em> Sometimes our Neighbours <em>want</em> the
            <em>Things</em> which we <em>have</em>, or <em>have</em> the Things which we want; and we both fight, till
            they take ours or give us theirs. It is a very justifiable Cause of War to invade a Country after the People
            have been wasted by Famine, destroyed by Pestilence, or embroiled by Factions amongst themselves. It is
            justifiable to enter into War against our nearest Ally, when one of his Towns lies convenient for us, or a
            Territory of Land, that would render our Dominions round and compact.* If a Prince send Forces into a
            Nation, where the People are poor and ignorant, he may lawfully put half of them to Death, and make Slaves
            of the rest, in order to civilize and reduce* them from their barbarous Way of Living. It is a very kingly,
            honourable, and frequent Practice, when one Prince desires the Assistance of another to secure him against
            an Invasion, that the Assistant, when he hath driven out the Invader, should seize on the Dominions himself,
            and kill, imprison or banish the Prince he came to relieve. Allyance by Blood or Marriage, is a suﬃcient
            Cause of War between Princes; and the nearer the Kindred is, the greater is their Disposition to quarrel:
            <em>Poor</em> Nations are <em>hungry</em>, and <em>rich</em> Nations are <em>proud</em>; and Pride and
            Hunger will ever be at Variance. For these Reasons, the Trade of a <em>Soldier</em> is held the most
            honourable of all others: Because a <em>Soldier</em> is a <em>Yahoo</em> hired to kill in cold Blood as many
            of his own Species, who have never oﬀended him, as possibly he can.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There is likewise a Kind of beggarly Princes in <em>Europe</em>, not able to make War by themselves, who hire
            out their Troops to richer</p>

        <p>Nations for so much a Day to each Man; of which they keep three Fourths to themselves, and it is the best
            Part of their Maintenance; such are those in many <em>Northern</em> Parts of <em>Europe.</em>*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What you have told me, (said my Master) upon the Subject of War, doth indeed discover most admirably the
            Eﬀects of that Reason you pretend to: However, it is happy that the <em>Shame</em> is greater than the
            <em>Danger</em>; and that Nature hath left you utterly uncapable of doing much Mischief: For your Mouths
            lying flat with your Faces, you can hardly bite each other to any Purpose, unless by Consent. Then, as to
            the Claws upon your Feet before and behind, they are so short and tender, that one of our <em>Yahoos</em>
            would drive a Dozen of yours before him. And therefore in recounting the Numbers of those who have been
            killed in Battle, I cannot but think that you have <em>said the Thing</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>which is not.</em></p>
        <p>I could not forbear shaking my Head and smiling a little at his Ignorance.* And, being no Stranger to the Art
            of War,* I gave him a Description of Cannons, Culverins,* Muskets, Carabines,* Pistols, Bullets, Powder,
            Swords, Bayonets, Sieges, Retreats, Attacks, Undermines,* Countermines,* Bombardments, Sea-fights; Ships
            sunk with a Thousand Men; twenty Thousand killed on each Side; dying Groans, Limbs flying in the Air: Smoak,
            Noise, Confusion, trampling to Death under Horses Feet: Flight, Pursuit, Victory; Fields strewed with
            Carcases left for Food to Dogs, and Wolves, and Birds of Prey; Plundering, Stripping, Ravishing, Burning and
            Destroying. And, to set forth the Valour of my own dear Country-men, I assured him, that I had seen them
            blow up a Hundred Enemies at once in a Siege, and as many in a Ship; and beheld the dead Bodies drop down in
            Pieces from the Clouds, to the great Diversion of all the Spectators.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was going on to more Particulars, when my Master commanded me Silence. He said, whoever understood the
            Nature of <em>Yahoos</em> might easily believe it possible for so vile an Animal, to be capable of every
            Action I had named, if their Strength and Cunning equalled their Malice. But, as my Discourse had increased
            his Abhorrence of the whole Species, so he found it gave him a Disturbance in his Mind, to which he was
            wholly a Stranger before. He thought his Ears being used to such abominable Words, might by Degrees admit
            them with less Detestation. That, although he hated the <em>Yahoos</em> of this Country, yet he no more
            blamed them for their odious Qualities,</p>

        <p>than he did a <em>Gnnayh</em> (a Bird of Prey) for its Cruelty, or a sharp Stone for cutting his Hoof.* But,
            when a Creature pretending to Reason, could be capable of such Enormities, he dreaded lest the Corruption of
            that Faculty might be worse than Brutality itself. He seemed therefore confident, that instead of Reason, we
            were only possessed of some Quality fitted to increase our natural Vices; as the Reflection from a troubled
            Stream returns the Image of an ill-shapen Body, not only <em>larger</em>, but more <em>distorted.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He added, That he had heard too much upon the Subject of War, both in this, and some former Discourses. There
            was another Point which a little perplexed him at present. I had said, that some of our Crew left their
            Country on Account of being ruined by <em>Law</em>: That I had already explained the Meaning of the Word;
            but he was at a Loss how it should come to pass, that the <em>Law</em> which was intended for <em>every</em>
            Man&rsquo;s Preservation, should be any Man&rsquo;s Ruin. Therefore he desired to be farther satisfied what
            I meant by <em>Law</em>, and the Dispensers thereof, according to the present Practice in my own Country:
            Because he thought, Nature and Reason were suﬃcient Guides for a reasonable Animal,* as we pretended to be,
            in shewing us what we ought to do, and what to avoid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I assured his Honour, that <em>Law</em> was a Science wherein I had not much conversed, further than by
            employing Advocates, in vain, upon some Injustices that had been done me. However, I would give him all the
            Satisfaction I was able.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I said there was a Society of Men among us,* bred up from their Youth in the Art of proving by Words
            multiplied for the Purpose, that <em>White</em> is <em>Black</em>, and <em>Black</em> is <em>White</em>,
            according as they are paid. To this Society all the rest of the People are Slaves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For Example. If my Neighbour hath a mind to my <em>Cow</em>, he hires a Lawyer to prove that he ought to have
            my <em>Cow</em> from me. I must then hire another to defend my Right; it being against all Rules of
            <em>Law</em> that any Man should be allowed to speak for himself.* Now in this Case, I who am the true Owner
            lie under two great Disadvantages. First, my Lawyer being practiced almost from his Cradle in defend-ing
            Falshood; is quite out of his Element when he would be an Advocate for Justice, which as an Oﬃce unnatural,
            he always attempts with great Awkwardness, if not with Ill-will. The second Disadvantage is, that my Lawyer
            must proceed with great Caution: Or else he will be reprimanded by the Judges, and abhorred by his</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>232&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Brethren, as one who would lessen the Practice* of the Law. And therefore I have but two Methods to preserve
            my <em>Cow.</em> The first is, to gain over my Adversary&rsquo;s Lawyer with a double Fee; who will then
            betray his Client, by insinuating that he hath Justice on his Side. The second Way is for my Lawyer to make
            my Cause appear as unjust as he can; by allowing the <em>Cow</em> to belong to my Adversary; and this if it
            be skilfully done, will certainly bespeak the Favour of the Bench.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, your Honour is to know, that these Judges are Persons appointed to decide all Controversies of Property,
            as well as for the Tryal of Criminals; and picked out from the most dexterous Lawyers who are grown old or
            lazy: And having been byassed all their Lives against Truth and Equity, are under such a fatal Necessity of
            favour-ing Fraud, Perjury and Oppression; that I have known some of them to have refused a large Bribe from
            the Side where Justice lay, rather than injure the <em>Faculty,</em>* by doing any thing unbecoming their
            Nature or their Oﬃce.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is a Maxim among these Lawyers, that whatever hath been done before, may legally be done again: And
            therefore they take special Care to record all the Decisions formerly made against common Justice and the
            general Reason of Mankind. These, under the Name of <em>Precedents</em>, they produce as Authorities to
            justify the most iniquitous Opinions; and the Judges never fail of decreeing accordingly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In pleading, they studiously avoid entering into the <em>Merits</em> of the Cause; but are loud, violent and
            tedious in dwelling upon all <em>Circumstances</em> which are not to the Purpose. For Instance, in the Case
            already mentioned: They never desire to know what Claim or Title my Adversary hath to my <em>Cow</em>; but
            whether the said <em>Cow</em> were Red or Black; her Horns long or short; whether the Field I graze her in
            be round or square; whether she were milked at home or abroad; what Diseases she is subject to, and the
            like. After which they consult <em>Precedents</em>, adjourn the Cause, from Time to Time, and in Ten,
            Twenty, or Thirty Years come to an Issue.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is likewise to be observed, that this Society hath a peculiar Cant and Jargon of their own, that no other
            Mortal can understand, and wherein all their Laws are written, which they take special Care to multiply;
            whereby they have wholly confounded the very Essence of Truth and Falshood, of Right and Wrong; so that it
            will take Thirty</p>

            Stranger three Hundred Miles oﬀ.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the Tryal of Persons accused for Crimes against the State, the Method is much more short and commendable:
            The Judge first sends to sound the Disposition of those in Power,* after which he can easily hang or save
            the Criminal, strictly preserving all the Forms of Law.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here my Master interposing, said it was a Pity, that Creatures endowed with such prodigious Abilities of Mind
            as these Lawyers, by the Description I gave of them must certainly be, were not rather encouraged to be
            Instructors of others in Wisdom and Knowledge. In Answer to which, I assured his Honour, that in all Points
            out of their own Trade, they were usually the most ignorant and stupid Generation among us, the most
            despicable in common Conversa-tion, avowed Enemies to all Knowledge and Learning; and equally disposed to
            pervert the general Reason of Mankind, in every other Subject of Discourse, as in that of their own
            Profession.</p>

            disquiet, and weary themselves by engaging in a Confederacy of Injustice, merely for the Sake of injuring
            their Fellow-Animals; neither could he comprehend what I meant in saying they did it for <em>Hire.</em>
            Whereupon I was at much Pains to describe to him the Use of <em>Money</em>, the Materials it was made of,
            and the Value of the Metals:* That when a <em>Yahoo</em> had got a great Store of this precious Substance,
            he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to; the finest Cloathing, the noblest Houses, great Tracts of
            Land, the most costly Meats and Drinks; and have his Choice of the most beautiful Females. Therefore since
            <em>Money</em> alone, was able to perform all these Feats, our <em>Yahoos</em> thought, they could never
            have enough of it to spend or to save, as they found themselves inclined from their natural Bent either to
            Profusion or Avarice. That, the rich Man enjoyed the Fruit of the poor Man&rsquo;s Labour, and the latter
            were a Thousand to One in Proportion to the former. That the Bulk of our People was forced to live
            miserably, by labouring every Day for small Wages to make a few live plentifully.* I enlarged myself much on
            these and many other Particulars to the same Purpose: But his Honour was still to seek:* For he went upon a
            Supposition that all Animals had a Title to their Share in the Productions of the Earth; and especially
            those who presided over the rest. Therefore he desired I would let him know, what these costly Meats were,
            and how any of us happened to want them. Whereupon I enumerated as many Sorts as came into my Head, with the
            Various Methods of dressing them, which could not be done without sending Vessels by Sea to every Part of
            the World, as well for Liquors to drink, as for Sauces, and innumerable other Conveniences. I assured him,
            that this whole Globe of Earth must be at least three Times gone round,* before one of our better Female
            <em>Yahoos</em> could get her Breakfast, or a Cup to put it in. He said, That must needs be a miserable
            Country which cannot furnish Food for its own Inhabitants.</p>

        <p>But what he chiefly wondered at, was how such vast Tracts of Ground as I described, should be wholly without
            <em>Fresh water,</em> and the People put to the Necessity of sending over the Sea for Drink. I replied, that
            <em>England</em> (the dear Place of my Nativity) was computed to produce three Times the Quantity of Food,
            more than its Inhabit-ants are able to consume, as well as Liquors extracted from Grain, or pressed out of
            the Fruit of certain Trees, which made excellent Drink; and the same Proportion in every other Convenience
            of Life. But, in order to feed the Luxury and Intemperance of the Males, and the Vanity of the Females, we
            sent away the greatest Part of our necessary Things to other Countries, from whence in Return we brought the
            Materials of Diseases, Folly, and Vice, to spend among ourselves. Hence it follows of Necessity, that vast
            Numbers of our People are compelled to seek their Livelihood by Begging, Robbing, Stealing, Cheating,
            Pimping, Forswearing, Flattering, Suborning, Forging, Gaming, Lying, Fawning, Hectoring, Voting, Scribbling,
            Stargazing, Poisoning, Whoring, Canting, Libelling, Free-thinking, and the like Occupations: Every one of
            which Terms, I was at much Pains to make him understand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That, <em>Wine</em> was not imported among us from foreign Countries, to supply the Want of Water or other
            Drinks, but because it was a Sort of Liquid which made us merry, by putting us out of our Senses; diverted
            all melancholy Thoughts, begat wild extravagant Imagin-ations in the Brain, raised our Hopes, and banished
            our Fears; suspended every Oﬃce of Reason for a Time, and deprived us of the Use of our Limbs, untill we
            fell into a profound Sleep; although it must be confessed, that we always awaked sick and dispirited; and
            that the Use of this Liquor filled us with Diseases, which made our Lives uncomfortable and short.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But beside all this, the Bulk of our People supported them-selves by furnishing the Necessities or
            Conveniences of Life to the Rich, and to each other. For Instance, when I am at home and dressed as I ought
            to be, I carry on my Body the Workmanship of a Hundred Tradesmen,* the Building and Furniture of my House
            employ as many more; and five Times the Number to adorn my Wife.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was going on to tell him of another Sort of People, who get their Livelihood by attending the Sick having
            upon some Occasions informed his Honour that many of my Crew had died of Diseases.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>236&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But here it was with the utmost Diﬃculty, that I brought him to apprehend what I meant. He could easily
            conceive, that a <em>Houyhnhnm</em> grew weak and heavy a few Days before his Death; or by some Accident
            might hurt a Limb. But that Nature, who worketh all things to Perfection, should suﬀer any Pains to breed in
            our Bodies, he thought impossible; and desired to know the Reason of so unaccountable an Evil. I told him,
            we fed on a Thousand Things which operated contrary to each other; that we eat when we were not hungry, and
            drank without the Provocation of Thirst: That we sat whole Nights drinking strong Liquors without eating a
            Bit; which disposed us to Sloth, enflamed our Bodies, and precipitated or prevented Digestion. That,
            prostitute Female <em>Yahoos</em> acquired a certain Malady, which bred Rottenness in the Bones of those,
            who fell into their Embraces: That this and many other Diseases, were propagated from Father to Son; so that
            great Numbers come into the World with complicated Maladies upon them: That, it would be endless to give him
            a Catalogue of all Diseases incident to human Bodies; for they could not be fewer than five or six Hundred,
            spread over every Limb, and Joynt: In short, every Part, external and intes-tine, having Diseases
            appropriated to each. To remedy which, there was a Sort of People bred up among us, in the Profession or
            Pretence of curing the Sick. And because I had some Skill in the Faculty, I would in Gratitude to his
            Honour, let him know the whole Mystery* and Method by which they proceed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their Fundamental is, that all Diseases arise from <em>Repletion</em>; from whence they conclude, that a
            great <em>Evacuation</em> of the Body is neces-sary, either through the natural Passage, or upwards at the
            Mouth. Their next Business is, from Herbs, Minerals, Gums, Oyls, Shells, Salts, Juices, Sea-weed,
            Excrements, Barks of Trees, Serpents, Toads, Frogs, Spiders, dead Mens Flesh and Bones, Birds, Beasts and
            Fishes, to form a Composition for Smell and Taste the most abominable, nauseous and detestable, that they
            can possibly contrive, which the Stomach immediately rejects with Loathing: and this they call <em>a
                Vomit.</em>* Or else from the same Store-house, with some other poysonous Additions, they command us to
            take in at the Orifice <em>above</em> or <em>below</em>, (just as the Physician then happens to be disposed)
            a Medicine equally annoying and disgustful to the Bowels; which relaxing the Belly, drives down all before
            it: And this they call a <em>Purge</em>, or a <em>Clyster</em>.* For Nature (as the Physicians alledge)

        <p>intended the superior anterior Orifice only for the <em>Intromission</em> of Solids and Liquids, and the
            inferior Posterior for Ejection; these Artists ingeniously considering that in all Diseases Nature is forced
            out of her Seat; therefore to replace her in it, the Body must be treated in a Manner directly contrary, by
            interchanging the Use of each Orifice; forcing Solids and Liquids in at the <em>Anus</em>, and making
            Evacuations at the Mouth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, besides real Diseases, we are subject to many that are only imaginary, for which the Physicians have
            invented imaginary Cures; these have their several Names, and so have the Drugs that are proper for them;
            and with these our Female <em>Yahoos</em> are always infested.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One great Excellency in this Tribe is their Skill at <em>Prognosticks</em>, wherein they seldom fail; their
            Predictions in real Diseases, when they rise to any Degree of Malignity, generally portending
            <em>Death</em>, which is always in their Power, when Recovery is not: And therefore, upon any unexpected
            Signs of Amendment, after they have pronounced their Sentence, rather than be accused as false Prophets,
            they know how to approve their Sagacity to the World by a seasonable Dose.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They are likewise of special Use to Husbands and Wives, who are grown weary of their Mates; to eldest Sons,
            to great Ministers of State, and often to Princes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had formerly upon Occasion discoursed with my Master upon the Nature of <em>Government</em> in general, and
            particularly of our own <em>excellent Constitution</em>, deservedly the Wonder and Envy of the whole World.
            But having here accidentally mentioned a <em>Minister of State</em>; he commanded me some Time after to
            inform him, what Species of <em>Yahoo</em> I particularly meant by that Appellation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I told him, that a <em>First</em> or <em>Chief Minister of State</em>, whom I intended to describe, was a
            Creature wholly exempt from Joy and Grief, Love and Hatred, Pity and Anger; at least makes use of no other
            Passions but a violent Desire of Wealth, Power, and Titles: That he applies his Words to all Uses, except to
            the Indication of his Mind;* That he never tells a <em>Truth</em>, but with an Intent that you should take
            it for a <em>Lye</em>; nor a <em>Lye</em>, but with a Design that you should take it for a <em>Truth</em>;
            That those he speaks worst of behind their Backs, are in the surest way to Preferment; and whenever he
            begins to praise you to others or to your self, you are from that Day forlorn.* The worst Mark you can
            receive is a <em>Promise,</em> especially</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>when it is confirmed with an Oath;* after which every wise Man retires, and gives over all Hopes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are three Methods by which a Man may rise to be Chief Minister: The first is, by knowing how with
            Prudence to dispose of a Wife, a Daughter, or a Sister: The second, by betraying or under-mining his
            Predecessor: And the third is, by a <em>furious Zeal</em> in publick Assemblies against the Corruptions of
            the Court. But a wise Prince would rather chuse to employ those who practise the last of these Methods;
            because such Zealots prove always the most obsequious and subservient to the Will and Passions of their
            Master. That, these <em>Ministers</em> having all Employments at their Disposal, preserve themselves in
            Power by bribing the Majority of a Senate or great Council; and at last by an Expedient called an <em>Act of
                Indemnity</em>* (whereof I described the Nature to him) they secure themselves from After-reckonings,
            and retire from the Publick, laden with the Spoils of the Nation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Palace of a <em>Chief Minister</em>, is a Seminary to breed up others in his own Trade: The Pages,
            Lacquies, and Porter, by imitating their Master, become <em>Ministers of State</em> in their several
            Districts, and learn to excel in the three principal <em>Ingredients</em>, of <em>Insolence</em>,
            <em>Lying</em>, and <em>Bribery.</em> Accordingly, they have a <em>Subaltern</em> Court paid to them by
            Persons of the best Rank; and sometimes by the Force of Dexterity and Impudence, arrive through several
            Gradations to be Successors to their Lord.</p>
        <p>He is usually governed by a decayed Wench, or favourite Footman, who are the Tunnels* through which all
            Graces are conveyed, and may properly be called, <em>in the last Resort</em>, the Governors of the Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One Day, my Master, having heard me mention the <em>Nobility</em> of my Country, was pleased to make me a
            Compliment which I could not pretend to deserve: That, he was sure, I must have been born of some Noble
            Family, because I far exceeded in Shape, Colour, and Cleanliness, all the <em>Yahoos</em> of his Nation,
            although I seemed to fail in Strength, and Agility, which must be imputed to my diﬀerent Way of Living from
            those other Brutes; and besides, I was not only endowed with the Faculty of Speech, but likewise with some
            Rudiments of Reason, to a Degree, that with all his Acquaintance I passed for a Prodigy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He made me observe, that among the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, the <em>White</em>, the</p>

                Dapple-grey</em>, and the <em>Black</em>; nor born with equal Talents of Mind, or a Capacity to improve
            them; and therefore continued always in the Condition of Servants, without ever aspiring to match out of
            their own Race, which in that Country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I made his Honour my most humble Acknowledgements for the good Opinion he was pleased to conceive of me; but
            assured him at the same Time, that my Birth was of the lower Sort, having been born of plain, honest
            Parents, who were just able to give me a toler-able Education: That, <em>Nobility</em> among us was
            altogether a diﬀerent Thing from the Idea he had of it; That, our young <em>Noblemen</em> are bred from
            their Childhood in Idleness and Luxury; that, as soon as Years will permit, they consume their Vigour, and
            contract odious Diseases among lewd Females; and when their Fortunes are almost ruined, they marry some
            Woman of mean Birth, disagreeable Person, and unsound Constitution, merely for the sake of Money, whom they
            hate and despise. That, the Productions of such Marriages are generally scrophulous, rickety or deformed
            Children; by which Means the Family seldom continues above three Generations, unless the Wife take Care to
            provide a healthy Father among her Neigh-bours or Domesticks, in order to improve and continue the Breed.
            That, a weak diseased Body, a meagre Countenance, and sallow Complexion, are the true Marks of <em>noble
                Blood</em>; and a healthy robust Appearance is so disgraceful in a Man of Quality, that the World
            concludes his real Father to have been a Groom or a Coachman. The Imperfections of his Mind run parallel
            with those of his Body; being a Composition of Spleen, Dulness, Ignorance, Caprice, Sensuality and Pride.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h e Reader may be disposed to wonder how I could prevail on my self to give so free a Representation of my
            own Species, among a Race of Mortals who were already too apt to conceive the vilest Opinion of Human Kind,
            from that entire Congruity betwixt me and their <em>Yahoos</em>. But I must freely confess, that the many
            Virtues of those excellent <em>Quadrupeds</em> placed in opposite View to human Corruptions, had so far
            opened my Eyes, and enlarged my Under-standing, that I began to view the Actions and Passions of Man in a
            very diﬀerent Light; and to think the Honour of my own Kind not worth managing;* which, besides, it was
            impossible for me to do before a Person of so acute a Judgment as my Master, who daily convinced me of a
            thousand Faults in my self, whereof I had not the least Perception before, and which with us would never be
            numbered even among human Infirmities. I had likewise learned from his Example an utter Detestation of all
            Falsehood or Disguise; and <em>Truth</em> appeared so amiable to me,* that I determined upon sacrificing
            every thing to it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Let me deal so candidly with the Reader, as to confess, that there was yet a much stronger Motive for the
            Freedom I took in my Representation of Things. I had not been a Year in this Country, before I contracted
            such a Love and Veneration for the Inhabitants, that I entered on a firm Resolution never to return to human
            Kind, but to pass the rest of my Life among these admirable <em>Houyhnhnms</em> in the Contemplation and
            Practice of every Virtue; where I could have no Example or Incitement to Vice. But it was decreed by
            For-tune, my perpetual Enemy, that so great a Felicity should not fall to my Share. However, it is now some
            Comfort to reflect, that in what I said of my Countrymen, I <em>extenuated</em> their Faults as much as I
            durst before so strict an Examiner; and upon every Article, gave as <em>favourable</em> a Turn as the Matter
            would bear. For, indeed, who is there</p>

        <p>alive that will not be swayed by his Byass and Partiality to the Place of his Birth?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have related the Substance of several Conversations I had with my Master, during the greatest Part of the
            Time I had the Honour to be in his Service; but have indeed for Brevity sake omitted much more than is here
            set down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I had answered all his Questions, and his Curiosity seemed to be fully satisfied; he sent for me one
            Morning early, and commanding me to sit down at some Distance, (an Honour which he had never before
            conferred upon me) He said, he had been very seriously considering my whole Story, as far as it related both
            to my self and my Country: That, he looked upon us as a Sort of Animals to whose Share, by what Accident he
            could not conjecture, some small Pittance of <em>Reason</em> had fallen, whereof we made no other Use than
            by its Assistance to aggravate our <em>natural</em> Corruptions, and to acquire new ones which Nature had
            not given us. That, we disarmed our selves of the few Abilities she had bestowed; had been very successful
            in multiplying our original Wants, and seemed to spend our whole Lives in vain Endeavours to supply them by
            our own Inventions. That, as to my self, it was manifest I had neither the Strength or Agility of a common
            <em>Yahoo</em>; that I walked infirmly on my hinder Feet; had found out a Contrivance to make my Claws of no
            Use or Defence, and to remove the Hair from my Chin, which was intended as a Shelter from the Sun and the
            Weather. Lastly, that I could neither run with Speed, nor climb Trees like my <em>Brethren</em> (as he
            called them) the <em>Yahoos</em> in this Country.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That, our Institutions of <em>Government</em> and <em>Law</em> were plainly owing to our gross Defects in
            <em>Reason,</em> and by consequence, in <em>Virtue</em>; because <em>Reason</em> alone is suﬃcient to govern
            a <em>Rational</em> Creature; which was therefore a Character we had no Pretence to challenge,* even from
            the Account I had given of my own People; although he manifestly perceived, that in order to favour them, I
            had concealed many Particulars, and often <em>said the Thing which</em></p>
        <p><em>was not.</em></p>
        <p>He was the more confirmed in this Opinion, because he observed, that as I agreed in every Feature of my Body
            with other <em>Yahoos</em>, except where it was to my real Disadvantage in point of Strength, Speed and
            Activity, the Shortness of my Claws, and some other Particulars where Nature had no Part; so, from the
            Representation I</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>242&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>had given him of our Lives, our Manners, and our Actions, he found as near a Resemblance in the Disposition
            of our Minds. He said, the <em>Yahoos</em> were known to hate one another more than they did any diﬀerent
            Species of Animals; and the Reason usually assigned, was, the Odiousness of their own Shapes, which all
            could see in the rest, but not in themselves. He had therefore begun to think it not unwise in us to
            <em>cover</em> our Bodies, and by that Invention, conceal many of our Deformities from each other, which
            would else be hardly supportable. But, he now found he had been mistaken; and that the Dissentions of those
            Brutes in his Country were owing to the same Cause with ours, as I had described them. For, if (said he) you
            throw among five <em>Yahoos</em> as much Food as would be suﬃcient for fifty, they will, instead of eating
            peaceably, fall together by the Ears, each single one impatient to <em>have all to it self</em>; and
            therefore a Servant was usually employed to stand by while they were feeding abroad, and those kept at home
            were tied at a Distance from each other. That, if a Cow died of Age or Accident, before a <em>Houyhnhnm</em>
            could secure it for his own <em>Yahoos,</em> those in the Neighbourhood would come in Herds to seize it, and
            then would ensue such a Battle as I had described, with terrible Wounds made by their Claws on both Sides,
            although they seldom were able to kill one another, for want of such convenient Instruments of Death as we
            had invented. At other Times the like Battles have been fought between the <em>Yahoos</em> of several
            Neighbourhoods without any visible Cause: Those of one District watching all Opportunities to surprise the
            next before they are prepared. But if they find their Project hath miscarried, they return home, and for
            want of Enemies, engage in what I call a <em>Civil War</em> among themselves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That, in some Fields of his Country, there are certain <em>shining Stones</em> of several Colours,* whereof
            the <em>Yahoos</em> are violently fond; and when Part of these <em>Stones</em> are fixed in the Earth, as it
            sometimes happeneth, they will dig with their Claws for whole Days to get them out, then carry them away,
            and hide them by Heaps in their Kennels; but still looking round with great Caution, for fear their Comrades
            should find out their Treasure. My master said, he could never discover the Reason of this unnatural
            Appetite, or how these <em>Stones</em> could be of any Use to a <em>Yahoo</em>; but now he believed it might
            proceed from the same Principle of <em>Avarice</em>, which I had ascribed to Mankind. That he had once by
            way of Experiment,* privately removed a Heap</p>

        <p>of these <em>Stones</em> from the Place where one of his <em>Yahoos</em> had buried it: Whereupon, the
            sordid* Animal missing his Treasure, by his loud lamenting brought the whole Herd to the Place, there
            miserably howled, then fell to biting and tearing the rest; began to pine away, would neither eat nor sleep,
            nor work, till he ordered a Servant privately to convey the <em>Stones</em> into the same Hole, and hide
            them as before; which when his <em>Yahoo</em> had found, he presently recovered his Spirits and good Humour;
            but took Care to remove them to a better hiding Place; and hath ever since been a very serviceable Brute.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Master farther assured me, which I also observed my self; That in the Fields where the <em>shining
                Stones</em> abound, the fiercest and most frequent Battles are fought, occasioned by perpetual Inroads
            of the neighbouring <em>Yahoos.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He said, it was common when two <em>Yahoos</em> discovered such a <em>Stone</em> in a Field, and were
            contending which of them should be the Propri-etor, a third would take the Advantage, and carry it away from
            them both; which my Master would needs contend to have some Resem-blance with our <em>Suits at Law</em>;
            wherein I thought it for our Credit not to undeceive him; since the Decision he mentioned was much more
            equitable than many Decrees among us: Because the Plaintiﬀ and Defendant there lost nothing beside the
            <em>Stone</em> they contended for; whereas our <em>Courts of Equity</em>,* would never have dismissed the
            Cause while either of them had any thing left.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Master continuing his Discourse, said, There was nothing that rendered the <em>Yahoos</em> more odious,
            than their undistinguishing Appetite* to devour every thing that came in their Way, whether Herbs, Roots,
            Berries, the corrupted Flesh of Animals, or all mingled together: And it was peculiar in their Temper, that
            they were fonder of what they could get by Rapine or Stealth at a greater Distance, than much better Food
            provided for them at home. If their Prey held out, they would eat till they were ready to burst, after which
            Nature had pointed out to them a certain <em>Root</em> that gave them a general Evacuation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was also another Kind of <em>Root</em> very <em>juicy,</em> but something rare and diﬃcult to be found,
            which the <em>Yahoos</em> sought for with much Eagerness, and would suck it with great Delight: It produced
            the same Eﬀects that Wine hath upon us. It would make them sometimes hug, and sometimes tear one another;
            they would howl and grin, and chatter, and reel, and tumble, and then fall asleep in the Mud.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>244&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I did indeed observe, that the <em>Yahoos</em> were the only Animals in his Country subject to any Diseases;
            which however, were much fewer than Horses have among us, and contracted not by any ill Treatment they meet
            with, but by the Nastiness and Greediness of that sordid Brute. Neither has their Language* any more than a
            general Appella-tion for those Maladies; which is borrowed from the Name of the Beast, and called <em>Hnea
                Yahoo</em>, or the <em>Yahoo&rsquo;s-Evil</em>; and the Cure prescribed is a Mixture of <em>their own
                Dung</em> and <em>Urine</em>, forcibly put down the <em>Yahoo</em>&rsquo;s Throat. This I have since
            often known to have been taken with Success: And do here freely recommend it to my Countrymen, for the
            publick Good, as an admirable Specifick against all diseases produced by Repletion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As to Learning, Government, Arts, Manufactures, and the like; my Master confessed he could find little or no
            Resemblance between the <em>Yahoos</em> of that Country and those in ours. For, he only meant to observe
            what Parity there was in our Natures. He had heard indeed some curious <em>Houyhnhnms</em> observe, that in
            most Herds there was a Sort of ruling <em>Yahoo</em>, (as among us there is generally some leading or
            principal Stag in a Park) who was always more <em>deformed</em> in Body, and <em>mischievous in
                Disposition,</em> than any of the rest. That, this <em>Leader</em> had usually a Favourite as <em>like
                himself</em> as he could get, whose Employ-ment was to <em>lick his Master&rsquo;s Feet and Posteriors,
                and drive the Female</em> Yahoos <em>to his Kennel</em>; for which he was now and then rewarded with a
            Piece of Ass&rsquo;s Flesh. This <em>Favourite</em> is hated by the whole Herd; and therefore to protect
            himself, keeps always <em>near the Person of his Leader.</em> He usually continues in Oﬃce till worse can be
            found; but the very Moment he is discarded, his Successor, at the Head of all the <em>Yahoos</em> in that
            District, Young and Old, Male and Female, come in a Body, and discharge their Excrements upon him from Head
            to Foot. But how far this might be applicable to our <em>Courts</em> and <em>Favourites</em>, and
            <em>Ministers of State</em>, my Master said I could best determine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I durst make no Return to this malicious Insinuation, which debased human Understanding below the Sagacity of
            a common <em>Hound</em>, who hath Judgment enough to distinguish and follow the Cry of the <em>ablest Dog in
                the Pack</em>, without being ever mistaken.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Master told me, there were some Qualities remarkable in the <em>Yahoos</em>, which he had not observed me
            to mention, or at least very slightly, in the Accounts I had given him of human Kind. He said,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>

                    <td width="64">
                        <p>245</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>those Animals, like other Brutes, had their Females in common;* but in this they diﬀered, that the
            She-<em>Yahoo</em> would admit the Male, while she was pregnant; and that the Hees would quarrel and fight
            with the Females as fiercely as with each other. Both which Practices were such Degrees of infamous
            Brutality, that no other sensitive Creature ever arrived at.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another Thing he wondered at in the <em>Yahoos</em>, was their strange Disposition to Nastiness and Dirt;
            whereas there appears to be a natural Love of Cleanliness in all other Animals. As to the two former
            Accusations, I was glad to let them pass without any Reply, because I had not a Word to oﬀer upon them in
            Defence of my Species, which otherwise I certainly had done from my own Inclin-ations. But I could have
            easily vindicated human Kind from the Imputation of Singularity upon the last Article, if there had been any
            <em>Swine</em> in that Country, (as unluckily for me there were not) which although it may be a <em>sweeter
                Quadruped</em> than a <em>Yahoo</em>, cannot I hum-bly conceive in Justice pretend to more Cleanliness;
            and so his Honour himself must have owned, if he had seen their filthy Way of feeding, and their Custom of
            wallowing and sleeping in the Mud.</p>
        <p>My Master likewise mentioned another Quality which his Servants had discovered in several <em>Yahoos</em>,
            and to him was wholly unaccount-able. He said, a Fancy would sometimes take a <em>Yahoo</em> to retire into
            a Corner, to lie down and howl, and groan, and spurn away all that came near him, although he were young and
            fat, wanted neither Food nor Water; nor did the Servants imagine what could possibly ail him. And the only
            Remedy they found was to set him to hard Work, after which he would infallibly come to himself. To this I
            was silent out of Partiality to my own Kind; yet here I could plainly discover the true Seeds of
            <em>Spleen</em>,* which only seizeth on the <em>Lazy</em>, the <em>Luxurious</em>, and the <em>Rich</em>;
            who, if they were forced to undergo the <em>same Regimen</em>, I would undertake for the Cure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His Honour had farther observed, that a Female <em>Yahoo</em>* would often stand behind a Bank or a Bush, to
            gaze on the young Males passing by, and then appear, and hide, using many antick Gestures and Grimaces; at
            which time it was observed, that she had a most <em>o</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>ensive Smell</em>; and when any of
            the Males advanced, would slowly retire, looking often back, and with a counterfeit Shew of Fear, run oﬀ
            into some convenient Place where she knew the Male would follow her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>246&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At other times, if a Female Stranger came among them, three or four of her own Sex would get about her, and
            stare and chatter, and grin, and smell her all over; and then turn oﬀ with Gestures that seemed to express
            Contempt and Disdain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps my Master might refine a little in these Speculations, which he had drawn from what he observed
            himself, or had been told him by others: However, I could not reflect without some Amazement, and much
            Sorrow, that the Rudiments of <em>Lewdness</em>, <em>Coquetry</em>, <em>Censure</em>, and <em>Scandal</em>,
            should have Place by Instinct in Womankind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I expected every Moment, that my Master would accuse the <em>Yahoos</em> of those unnatural Appetites in both
            Sexes, so common among us. But Nature it seems hath not been so expert a School-mistress; and these politer
            Pleasures* are entirely the Productions of Art and Reason, on our Side of the Globe.</p>

        <p><em>The Author relateth several Particulars of the</em> Yahoos<em>. The great Virtues of the</em>
            Houyhnhnms<em>. The Education and Exercise of their Youth. Their general Assembly.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A s I ought to have understood human Nature much better than I supposed it possible for my Master to do, so
            it was easy to apply the Character he gave of the <em>Yahoos</em> to myself and my Countrymen; and I
            believed I could yet make farther Discoveries from my own Observation. I therefore often begged his Honour
            to let me go among the Herds of <em>Yahoos</em> in the Neighbourhood; to which he always very graciously
            consented, being perfectly convinced that the Hatred I bore those Brutes would never suﬀer me to be
            corrupted by them; and his Honour ordered one of his Servants, a strong Sorrel Nag,* very honest and
            good-natured, to be my Guard; without whose Protection I durst not undertake such Adventures. For I have
            already told the Reader how much I was pestered by those odious Animals upon my first Arrival. I afterwards
            failed very narrowly three or four times of falling into their Clutches, when I happened to stray at any
            Distance without my Hanger. And I have Reason to believe, they had some Imagination that I was of their own
            Species, which I often assisted myself, by stripping up my Sleeves, and shew-ing my naked Arms and Breast in
            their Sight, when my Protector was with me: At which times they would approach as near as they durst, and
            imitate my Actions after the Manner of Monkeys, but ever with great Signs of Hatred; as a tame <em>Jack
                Daw</em> with Cap and Stockings, is always persecuted by the wild ones, when he happens to be got among
            them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They are prodigiously nimble from their Infancy; however, I once caught a young Male of three Years old, and
            endeavoured by all Marks of Tenderness to make it quiet; but the little Imp fell a squall-ing, and
            scratching, and biting with such Violence, that I was forced to let it go; and it was high time, for a whole
            Troop of old ones came about us at the Noise; but finding the Cub was safe, (for away it ran) and my Sorrel
            Nag being by, they durst not venture near us. I observed the young Animal&rsquo;s Flesh to smell very rank,
            and the Stink</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>248&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was somewhat between a <em>Weasel</em> and a <em>Fox</em>, but much more disagree-able. I forgot another
            Circumstance, (and perhaps I might have the Reader&rsquo;s Pardon, if it were wholly omitted) that while I
            held the odious Vermin in my Hands, it voided its filthy Excrements of a yellow liquid Substance, all over
            my Cloaths; but by good Fortune there was a small Brook hard by, where I washed myself as clean as I could;
            although I durst not come into my Master&rsquo;s Presence, until I were suﬃciently aired.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By what I could discover, the <em>Yahoos</em> appear to be the most unteachable of all Animals, their
            Capacities never reaching higher than to draw or carry Burthens. Yet I am of Opinion, this Defect ariseth
            chiefly from a perverse, restive Disposition. For they are cunning, malicious, treacherous and revengeful.
            They are strong and hardy, but of a cowardly Spirit, and by Consequence insolent, abject, and cruel. It is
            observed that, the <em>Red-haired</em> of both Sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest,*
            whom yet they much exceed in Strength and Activity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The <em>Houyhnhnms</em> keep the <em>Yahoos</em> for present* Use in Huts not far from the House; but the
            rest are sent abroad to certain Fields, where they dig up Roots, eat several Kinds of Herbs, and search
            about for Carrion, or sometimes catch <em>Weasels</em> and <em>Luhimuhs</em> (a Sort of <em>wild</em> Rat)
            which they greedily devour. Nature has taught them to dig deep Holes with their Nails on the Side of a
            rising Ground, wherein they lie by themselves; only the Kennels of the Females are larger, suﬃcient to hold
            two or three Cubs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They swim from their Infancy like Frogs, and are able to continue long under Water, where they often take
            Fish, which the Females carry home to their Young. And upon this Occasion, I hope the Reader will pardon my
            relating an odd Adventure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Being one Day abroad with my Protector the Sorrel Nag, and the Weather exceeding hot, I entreated him to let
            me bathe in a River that was near. He consented, and I immediately stripped myself stark naked, and went
            down softly* into the Stream. It happened that a young Female <em>Yahoo</em>* standing behind a Bank, saw
            the whole Proceeding; and inflamed by Desire, as the Nag and I conjectured, came running with all Speed, and
            leaped into the Water within five Yards of the Place where I bathed. I was never in my Life so terribly
            frighted; the Nag was grazing at some Distance, not suspecting any Harm: She embraced me after a most
            fulsome Manner; I roared as</p>

        <p>loud as I could, and the Nag came galloping towards me, whereupon she quitted her Grasp, with the utmost
            Reluctancy, and leaped upon the opposite Bank, where she stood gazing and howling all the time I was putting
            on my Cloaths.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was Matter of Diversion to my Master and his Family, as well as of Mortification to my self. For now I
            could no longer deny, that I was a real <em>Yahoo</em>, in every Limb and Feature, since the Females had a
            natural Propensity to me as one of their own Species: Neither was the Hair of this Brute of a Red Colour,
            (which might have been some Excuse for an Appetite a little irregular) but black as a Sloe, and her
            Countenance did not make an Appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of the Kind; for, I think, she
            could not be above Eleven Years old.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having already lived three Years in this Country, the Reader I suppose will expect, that I should, like other
            Travellers, give him some Account of the Manners and Customs of its Inhabitants, which it was indeed my
            principal Study to learn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As these noble <em>Houyhnhnms</em> are endowed by Nature with a general Disposition to all Virtues, and have
            no Conceptions or Ideas of what is evil in a rational Creature, so their grand Maxim is, to cultivate
            <em>Reason</em>, and to be wholly governed by it. Neither is <em>Reason</em> among them a Point
            problematical as with us, where Men can argue with Plausibility on both Sides of a Question; but strikes you
            with immediate Conviction;* as it must needs do where it is not mingled, obscured, or discoloured by Passion
            and Interest. I remember it was with extreme Diﬃculty that I could bring my Master to understand the Meaning
            of the Word <em>Opinion</em>, or how a Point could be disput-able; because <em>Reason</em> taught us to aﬃrm
            or deny only where we are certain; and beyond our Knowledge we cannot do either. So that Controversies,
            Wranglings, Disputes, and Positiveness in false or dubious Propositions, are Evils unknown among the
            <em>Houyhnhnms.</em>* In the like Manner when I used to explain to him our several Systems of <em>Natural
                Philosophy</em>, he would laugh that a Creature pretending to <em>Reason</em>, should value itself upon
            the Knowledge of other Peoples Conjectures, and in Things, where that Knowledge, if it were certain, could
            be of no Use. Wherein he agreed entirely with the Sentiments of <em>Socrates</em>,* as <em>Plato</em>
            delivers them; which I mention as the highest Honour I can do that Prince of Philosophers. I have often
            since reflected what Destruction such a Doctrine would make in the</p>

        <p>Libraries of <em>Europe</em>; and how many Paths to Fame would be then shut up in the Learned World.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Friendship and <em>Benevolence</em> are the two principal Virtues among the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>; and these
            not confined to particular Objects, but universal to the whole Race. For, a Stranger from the remotest Part,
            is equally treated with the nearest Neighbour, and where-ever he goes, looks upon himself as at home.* They
            preserve <em>Decency</em> and <em>Civility</em> in the highest Degrees, but are altogether ignorant of
            <em>Ceremony</em>.* They have no Fondness* for their Colts or Foles; but the Care they take in educating
            them proceedeth entirely from the Dictates of <em>Reason.</em> And, I observed my Master to shew the same
            Aﬀection to his Neighbour&rsquo;s Issue that he had for his own.* They will have it that <em>Nature</em>
            teaches them to love the whole <em>Species</em>,* and it is <em>Reason</em> only that maketh a Distinction
            of Persons, where there is a superior Degree of Virtue.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the Matron <em>Houyhnhnms</em> have produced one of each Sex, they no longer accompany with their
            Consorts,* except they lose one of their Issue by some Casualty, which very seldom happens: But in such a
            Case they meet again; or when the like Accident befalls a Person, whose Wife is past bearing, some other
            Couple bestow on him one of their own Colts, and then go together a second Time, until the Mother be
            pregnant. This Caution is necessary to prevent the Country from being over-burthened with Numbers.* But the
            Race of inferior <em>Houyhnhnms</em> bred up to be Servants is not so strictly limited upon this Article;
            these are allowed to produce three of each Sex, to be Domesticks in the Noble Families.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In their Marriages they are exactly careful to chuse such Colours as will not make any disagreeable Mixture
            in the Breed.* <em>Strength</em> is chiefly valued in the Male, and <em>Comeliness</em> in the Female; not
            upon the Account of <em>Love</em>, but to preserve the Race from degenerating: For, where a Female happens
            to excel in <em>Strength</em>, a Consort is chosen with regard to <em>Comeliness.</em> Courtship, Love,
            Presents, Joyn-tures, Settlements, have no place in their Thoughts; or Terms whereby to express them in
            their Language. The young Couple meet and are joined, merely because it is the Determination of their
            Parents and Friends: It is what they see done every Day; and they look upon it as one of the necessary
            Actions in a reasonable Being.* But the Violation of Marriage, or any other Unchastity, was never heard of:*
            And the married Pair pass their Lives with the same</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In educating the Youth of both Sexes, their Method is admirable, and highly deserveth our Imitation. These
            are not suﬀered to taste a Grain of <em>Oats</em>, except upon certain Days, till Eighteen Years old; nor
            <em>Milk</em>, but very rarely; and in Summer they graze two Hours in the Morning, and as many in the
            Evening, which their Parents likewise observe; but the Servants are not allowed above half that Time; and a
            great Part of their Grass is brought home, which they eat at the most convenient Hours, when they can be
            best spared from Work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Temperance, <em>Industry</em>, <em>Exercise</em> and <em>Cleanliness</em>, are the Lessons equally enjoyned
            to the young ones of both Sexes: And my Master thought it monstrous in us to give the Females a diﬀerent
            Kind of Education from the Males,* except in some Articles of Domestick Management; whereby, as he truly
            observed, one Half of our Natives were good for nothing but bringing Children into the World: And to trust
            the Care of their Children to such useless Animals, he said was yet a greater Instance of Brutality.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> train up their Youth to Strength, Speed, and Hardiness, by exercising them in
            running Races up and down steep Hills, and over hard stony Grounds; and when they are all in a Sweat, they
            are ordered to leap over Head and Ears into a Pond or a River. Four times a Year the Youth of certain
            Districts meet to shew their Proficiency in Running, and Leaping, and other Feats of Strength or Agility;
            where the Victor is rewarded with a Song made in his or her Praise. On this Festival the Servants drive a
            Herd of <em>Yahoos</em> into the Field, laden with Hay, and Oats, and Milk for a Repast to the
            <em>Houyhnhnms</em>; after which, these Brutes are immediately driven back again, for fear of being noisome
            to the Assembly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Every fourth Year, at the <em>Vernal Equinox</em>, there is a Representa-tive Council of the whole Nation,*
            which meets in a Plain about twenty Miles from our House, and continueth about five or six Days. Here they
            inquire into the State and Condition of the several Districts; whether they abound or be deficient in Hay or
            Oats, or Cows or <em>Yahoos</em>? And where-ever there is any Want (which is but seldom) it is immediately
            supplied by unanimous Consent and</p>

        <p>Contribution. Here likewise the Regulation of Children is settled: As for instance, if a <em>Houyhnhnm</em>
            hath two Males, he changeth one of them with another who hath two Females: and when a Child hath been lost
            by any Casualty, where the Mother is past Breeding, it is determined what Family shall breed another to
            supply the Loss.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>A grand Debate at the General Assembly of the</em> Houyhnhnms<em>; and how it was determined. The
                Learning of the</em> Houyhnhnms<em>. Their Buildings. Their Manner of Burials. The Defectiveness of
                their Language.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O n e of these Grand Assemblies was held in my time, about three Months before my Departure, whither my
            Master went as the Representative of our District. In this Council was resumed their old Debate, and indeed,
            the only Debate that ever happened in their Country; whereof my Master after his Return gave me a very
            particular Account.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Question to be debated was, Whether the <em>Yahoos</em> should be exterminated from the Face of the
            Earth.* One of the <em>Members</em> for the Aﬃrmative oﬀered several Arguments of great Strength and Weight;
            alledging, That, as the <em>Yahoos</em> were the most filthy, noisome, and deformed Animal which Nature ever
            produced, so they were the most restive and indocible, mischievous and malicious: They would privately suck
            the Teats of the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> Cows; kill and devour their Cats, trample down their Oats and Grass, if
            they were not continually watched; and commit a Thousand other Extravagancies. He took Notice of a general
            Tradition, that <em>Yahoos</em> had not been always in their Country: But, that many Ages ago, two of these
            Brutes appeared together upon a Mountain;* whether produced by the Heat of the Sun upon corrupted Mud and
            Slime, or from the Ooze and Froth of the Sea,* was never known. That these <em>Yahoos</em> engendered, and
            their Brood in a short time grew so numerous as to overrun and infest the whole Nation. That the
            <em>Houyhnhnms</em> to get rid of this Evil, made a general Hunting, and at last inclosed the whole Herd;
            and destroying the Older, every <em>Houyhnhnm</em> kept two young Ones in a Kennel, and brought them to such
            a Degree of Tameness, as an Animal so savage by Nature can be capable of acquiring; using them for Draught
            and Carriage. That, there seemed to be much Truth in this Tradition, and that those Creatures could not be
            <em>Ylnhniamshy</em> (or <em>Aborigines</em> of the Land) because of the violent Hatred the
            <em>Houyhnhnms</em> as well as all other Animals, bore them; which although their evil Disposition
            suﬃciently deserved, could</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>254&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>never have arrived at so high a Degree, if they had been <em>Abori-gines,</em> or else they would have long
            since been rooted out. That, the Inhabitants taking a Fancy to use the Service of the <em>Yahoos,</em> had
            very imprudently neglected to cultivate the Breed of <em>Asses</em>,* which were a comely Animal, easily
            kept, more tame and orderly, without any oﬀensive Smell, strong enough for Labour, although they yield to
            the other in Agility of Body; and if their Braying be no agreeable Sound, it is far preferable to the
            horrible Howlings of the <em>Yahoos.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Several others declared their Sentiments to the same purpose; when my Master proposed an Expedient to the
            Assembly, whereof he had indeed borrowed the Hint from me. He approved of the Tradition, mentioned by the
            <em>Honourable Member</em>, who spoke before; and aﬃrmed that the two <em>Yahoos</em> said to be first seen
            among them, had been driven thither over the Sea; that coming to Land, and being forsaken by their
            Companions, they retired to the Mountains, and degenerating by Degrees, became in Process of Time, much more
            savage than those of their own Species in the Country from whence these two Originals came. The Reason of
            his Assertion was, that he had now in his Possession, a certain wonderful <em>Yahoo</em> (mean-ing myself )
            which most of them had heard of, and many of them had seen. He then related to them, how he first found me;
            that, my Body was all covered with an artificial Composure of the Skins and Hairs of other Animals: That, I
            spoke in a Language of my own, and had thoroughly learned theirs: That, I had related to him the Accidents
            which brought me thither: That, when he saw me without my Covering, I was an exact <em>Yahoo</em> in every
            Part, only of a whiter Colour, less hairy, and with shorter Claws. He added, how I had endeavoured to
            persuade him, that in my own and other Countries the <em>Yahoos</em> acted as the governing, rational
            Animal, and held the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> in Servitude: That, he observed in me all the Qualities of a
            <em>Yahoo</em>, only a little more civilized by some Tincture of Reason; which however was in a Degree as
            far inferior to the <em>Houyhnhnm</em> Race, as the <em>Yahoos</em> of their Country were to me: That, among
            other things, I mentioned a Custom we had of <em>castrating Houyhnhnms</em> when they were young, in order
            to render them tame; that the Operation was easy and safe; that it was no Shame to learn Wisdom from Brutes,
            as Industry is taught by the Ant, and Building by the Swallow. (For so I translate the Word
            <em>Lyhannh</em>, although it be a</p>

        <p>much larger Fowl) That, this Invention* might be practiced upon the younger <em>Yahoos</em> here, which,
            besides rendering them tractable and fitter for Use, would in an Age put an End to the whole Species without
            destroying Life. That, in the mean time the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> should be <em>exhorted</em> to cultivate the
            Breed of Asses, which, as they are in all respects more valuable Brutes; so they have this Advantage, to be
            fit for Service at five Years old, which the others are not till Twelve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was all my Master thought fit to tell me at that Time, of what passed in the Grand Council. But he was
            pleased to conceal* one Particular, which related personally to myself, whereof I soon felt the unhappy
            Eﬀect, as the Reader will know in its proper Place, and from whence I date all the succeeding Misfortunes of
            my Life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The <em>Houyhnhnms</em> have no Letters, and consequently, their Knowledge is all traditional. But there
            happening few Events of any Moment among a People so well united, naturally disposed to every Virtue, wholly
            governed by Reason, and cut oﬀ from all Commerce with other Nations; the historical Part is easily preserved
            without burthening their Memories. I have already observed, that they are subject to no Diseases, and
            therefore can have no Need of Physicians. However, they have excellent Medicines composed of Herbs, to cure
            accidental Bruises and Cuts in the Pastern or Frog of the Foot by sharp Stones, as well as other Maims and
            Hurts in the several Parts of the Body.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They calculate the Year by the Revolution of the Sun and the Moon, but use no Subdivisions into Weeks. They
            are well enough acquainted with the Motions of those two Luminaries, and under-stand the Nature of
            <em>Eclipses</em>; and this is the utmost Progress of their</p>
        <p><em>Astronomy.</em></p>
        <p>In <em>Poetry</em> they must be allowed to excel all other Mortals;* wherein the Justness of their Similes,
            and the Minuteness, as well as Exact-ness of their Descriptions, are indeed inimitable. Their Verses abound
            very much in both of these; and usually contain either some exalted Notions of Friendship and Benevolence,
            or the Praises of those who were Victors in Races, and other bodily Exercises. Their Buildings, although
            very rude and simple, are not inconvenient, but well contrived to defend them from all Injuries of Cold and
            Heat. They have a Kind of Tree, which at Forty Years old loosens in the Root, and falls with the first
            Storm; it grows very strait, and being</p>

        <p>256&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>pointed like Stakes with a sharp Stone, (for the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> know not the Use of Iron) they stick
            them erect in the Ground about ten Inches asunder, and then weave in Oat-straw, or sometimes Wattles betwixt
            them. The Roof is made after the same Manner, and so are the Doors.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The <em>Houyhnhnms</em> use the hollow Part between the Pastern and the Hoof of their Fore-feet, as we do our
            Hands, and this with greater Dexterity, than I could at first imagine. I have seen a white Mare of our
            Family thread a Needle (which I lent her on Purpose) with that Joynt. They milk their Cows, reap their Oats,
            and do all the Work which requires Hands, in the same Manner. They have a Kind of hard Flints, which by
            grinding against other Stones, they form into Instruments, that serve instead of Wedges, Axes, and Hammers.
            With Tools made of these Flints they likewise cut their Hay, and reap their Oats, which there groweth
            naturally in several Fields: The <em>Yahoos</em> draw home the Sheaves in Carriages, and the Servants tread
            them in certain covered Hutts, to get out the Grain, which is kept in Stores. They make a rude Kind of
            earthen and wooden Vessels, and bake the former in the Sun.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If they can avoid Casualties, they die only of old Age, and are buried in the obscurest Places that can be
            found, their Friends and Relations expressing neither Joy nor Grief* at their Departure; nor does the dying
            Person discover the least Regret that he is leaving the World, any more than if he were upon returning* home
            from a Visit to one of his Neighbours: I remember, my Master having once made an Appointment with a Friend
            and his family to come to his House upon some Aﬀair of Importance; on the Day fixed, the Mistress and her
            two Children came very late; she made two Excuses, first for her Husband, who, as she said, happened that
            very Morning to <em>Lhnuwnh.</em> The Word is strongly expressive in their Language, but not easily rendered
            into <em>English</em>; it signifies, <em>to retire to his</em><em> fi</em><em>rst Mother</em>. Her Excuse
            for not coming sooner, was, that her Husband dying late in the Morning, she was a good while consulting her
            Servants about a convenient Place where his Body should be laid; and I observed she behaved herself at our

            they feel a gradual Decay, but without Pain. During this time they are much visited by</p>

        <p>their Friends, because they cannot go abroad with their usual Ease and Satisfaction. However, about ten Days
            before their Death, which they seldom fail in computing they return the Visits that have been made them by
            those who are nearest in the Neighbourhood, being carried in a convenient Sledge drawn by <em>Yahoos</em>;
            which Vehicle they use, not only upon this Occasion, but when they grow old, upon long Journeys, or when
            they are lamed by any Accident. And therefore when the dying <em>Houyhnhnms</em> return those Visits, they
            take a solemn Leave of their Friends, as if they were going to some remote Part of the Country, where they
            designed to pass the rest of their Lives.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I know not whether it may be worth observing, that the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> have no Word in their Language to
            express any thing that is <em>evil</em>, except what they borrow from the Deformities or ill Qualities of
            the <em>Yahoos.</em> Thus they denote the Folly of a Servant, an Omission of a Child, a Stone that cuts
            their Feet, a Continuance of foul or unseasonable Weather, and the like, by adding to each the Epithet of
            <em>Yahoo.</em> For Instance, <em>Hhnm Yahoo</em>, <em>Whnaholm Yahoo</em>, <em>Ynlhmnawihlma Yahoo</em>,
            and an ill contrived House <em>Ynholmhnmrohlnw Yahoo</em>.</p>

        <p>I could with great Pleasure enlarge further upon the Manners and Virtues of this excellent People; but
            intending in a short time to publish a Volume by itself expressly upon that Subject, I refer the Reader
            thither. And in the mean time, proceed to relate my own sad Catastrophe.</p>

        <p><em>The Author&rsquo;s Oeconomy and happy Life among the</em> Houyhnhnms<em>. His great Improvement in
                Virtue, by conversing with them. Their Conversations. The Author hath Notice given him by his Master
                that he must depart from the Country. He falls into a Swoon for Grief, but submits. He contrives
                and</em><em> fi</em><em>nishes a Canoo, by the Help of a Fellow-Servant, and puts to Sea at a
                Venture.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I h a d settled my little Oeconomy to my own Heart&rsquo;s Content. My Master had ordered a Room to be made
            for me after their Manner, about six Yards from the House; the Sides and Floors of which I plaistered with
            Clay, and covered with Rush-mats of my own contriving: I had beaten Hemp, which there grows wild, and made
            of it a Sort of Ticking: This I filled with the Feathers of several Birds I had taken with Springes made of
            <em>Yahoos</em> Hairs; and were excellent Food. I had worked two Chairs with my Knife, the Sorrel Nag
            helping me in the grosser and more laborious Part. When my Cloaths were worn to Rags, I made my self others
            with the Skins of Rabbets, and of a certain beautiful Animal about the same Size, called <em>Nnuhnoh,</em>
            the Skin of which is covered with a fine Down. Of these I likewise made very tolerable Stockings. I soaled
            my Shoes with Wood which I cut from a Tree, and fitted to the upper Leather, and when this was worn out, I
            supplied it with the Skins of <em>Yahoos</em>, dried in the Sun. I often got Honey out of hollow Trees,
            which I mingled with Water,* or eat it with my Bread. No Man could more verify the Truth of these two
            Maxims, <em>That, Nature is very easily satis</em><em>fi</em><em>ed</em>; and, <em>That, Necessity is the
                Mother of Invention.</em> I enjoyed perfect Health of Body, and Tranquillity of Mind; I did not feel the
            Treachery or Inconstancy of a Friend, nor the Injuries of a secret or open Enemy.* I had no Occasion of
            bribing, flattering or pimping, to procure the Favour of any great Man, or of his Minion. I wanted no Fence
            against Fraud or Oppression: Here was neither Physician to destroy my Body, nor Lawyer to ruin my Fortune:
            No Informer to watch my Words and Actions, or forge Accusations against me for Hire; Here were no Gibers,
            Censurers, Backbiters, Pickpockets, Highwaymen, House-breakers, Attorneys, Bawds, Buﬀoons, Game-sters,
            Politicians, Wits, Spleneticks, tedious Talkers, Controvertists,*</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had the Favour of being admitted to several <em>Houyhnhnms,</em> who came to visit or dine with my Master;
            where his Honour graciously suﬀered me to wait in the Room, and listen to their Discourse. Both he and his
            Company would often descend* to ask me Questions, and receive my Answers. I had also sometimes the Honour of
            attending my Master in his Visits to others. I never presumed to speak, except in answer to a Question; and
            then I did it with inward Regret, because it was a Loss of so much Time for improving my self: But I was
            infinitely delighted with the Station of an humble Auditor in such Conversations, where nothing passed but
            what was useful, expressed in the fewest and most significant Words:* Where (as I have already said) the
            greatest <em>Decency</em> was observed, without the least Degree of Ceremony; where no Person spoke without
            being pleased himself, and pleasing his Companions: Where there was no Inter-ruption, Tediousness, Heat, or
            Diﬀerence of Sentiments. They have a Notion, That when People are met together, a short Silence doth much
            improve Conversation: This I found to be true; for during those little Intermissions of Talk, new Ideas
            would arise in their Minds, which very much enlivened the Discourse. Their Subjects* are generally on
            Friendship and Benevolence, or Order and Oeconomy; sometimes upon the visible Operations of Nature, or
            ancient Traditions; upon the Bounds and Limits of Virtue; upon the unerring Rules of Reason; or upon some
            Determinations, to be taken at the next great Assembly; and often upon the various Excellencies of
            <em>Poetry.</em> I may add, without Vanity, that my Presence often gave them suﬃcient Matter for Discourse,
            because it aﬀorded my Master an Occasion of letting his Friends into the History of me and my Country, upon
            which they were all pleased to discant in a Manner</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>260&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>not very advantageous to human Kind; and for that Reason I shall not repeat what they said: Only I may be
            allowed to observe, That his Honour, to my great Admiration, appeared to understand the Nature of
            <em>Yahoos</em> much better than my self. He went through all our Vices and Follies, and discovered many
            which I had never mentioned to him; by only supposing what Qualities a <em>Yahoo</em> of their Country, with
            a small Proportion of Reason, might be capable of exerting: And concluded, with too much Probability, how
            vile as well as miserable such a Creature must be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I freely confess, that all the little Knowledge I have of any Value, was acquired by the Lectures I received
            from my Master, and from hearing the Discourses of him and his Friends; to which I should be prouder to
            listen, than to dictate to the greatest and wisest Assembly in <em>Europe.</em> I admired the Strength,
            Comeliness and Speed of the Inhabitants; and such a Constellation of Virtues in such amiable Persons
            produced in me the highest Veneration. At first, indeed, I did not feel that natural Awe which the
            <em>Yahoos</em> and all other Animals bear towards them; but it grew upon me by Degrees, much sooner than I
            imagined, and was mingled with a respectful Love and Gratitude, that they would condescend to distinguish me
            from the rest of my Species.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I thought of my Family, my Friends, my Countrymen, or human Race in general, I considered them as they
            really were, <em>Yahoos</em> in Shape and Disposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and qualified with
            the Gift of Speech; but making no other Use of Reason, than to improve and multiply those Vices, whereof
            their Brethren in this Country had only the Share that Nature allotted them. When I happened to behold the
            Reflection of my own Form in a Lake or Fountain, I turned away my Face in Horror and detest-ation of my
            self;* and could better endure the Sight of a common <em>Yahoo</em>, than of my own Person. By conversing
            with the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, and looking upon them with Delight, I fell to imitate their Gait and Gesture,
            which is now grown into a Habit; and my Friends often tell me in a blunt Way, that <em>I trot like a
                Horse</em>; which, however, I take for a great Compliment: Neither shall I disown, that in speaking I am
            apt to fall into the Voice and manner of the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, and hear my self ridiculed on that Account
            without the least Mortification.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the Midst of all this Happiness, when I looked upon my self to be fully settled for Life, my Master sent
            for me one Morning a little</p>

        <p>earlier than his usual Hour. I observed by his Countenance that he was in some Perplexity, and at a Loss how
            to begin what he had to speak. After a short Silence, he told me, he did not know how I would take what he
            was going to say: That, in the last general Assembly, when the Aﬀair of the <em>Yahoos</em> was entered
            upon, the Representatives had taken Oﬀence at his keeping a <em>Yahoo</em> (meaning my self ) in his Family
            more like a <em>Houyhnhnm</em> than a Brute Animal. That, he was known frequently to converse with me, as if
            he could receive some Advantage or Pleasure in my Company: That, such a Practice was not agreeable to Reason
            or Nature, nor a thing ever heard of before among them. The Assembly did therefore <em>exhort</em> him,
            either to employ me like the rest of my Species, or command me to swim back to the Place from whence I came.
            That, the first of these Expedients was utterly rejected by all the <em>Houyhnhnms,</em> who had ever seen
            me at his House or their own: For, they alledged, That because I had some Rudiments of Reason, added to the
            natural Pravity of those Animals, it was to be feared, I might be able to seduce them into the woody and
            mountainous Parts of the Country, and bring them in Troops by Night to destroy the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>
            Cattle, as being naturally of the ravenous* Kind, and averse from Labour.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Master added, That he was daily pressed by the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> of the Neighbourhood to have the
            Assembly&rsquo;s <em>Exhortation</em> executed, which he could not put oﬀ much longer. He doubted, it would
            be impossible for me to swim to another Country; and therefore wished I would contrive some Sort of Vehicle*
            resembling those I had described to him, that might carry me on the Sea; in which Work I should have the
            Assistance of his own Servants, as well as those of his Neighbours. He concluded, that for his own Part he
            could have been content to keep me in this Service as long as I lived; because he found I had cured myself
            of some bad Habits and Dispositions, by endeavouring, as far as my inferior Nature was capable, to imitate
            the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Houyhnhnms.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I should here observe to the Reader, that a Decree of the general Assembly in this Country, is expressed by
            the Word <em>Hnhloayn,</em> which signifies an <em>Exhortation</em>; as near as I can render it: For they
            have no Conception how a rational Creature can be <em>compelled</em>, but only advised, or
            <em>exhorted</em>; because no Person can disobey Reason, without giving up his Claim to be a rational
            Creature.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was struck with the utmost Grief and Despair at my Master&rsquo;s Discourse; and being unable to support
            the Agonies I was under, I fell into a Swoon at his Feet: When I came to myself, he told me, that he
            concluded I had been dead. (For these People are subject to no such Imbecillities of Nature.) I answered, in
            a faint Voice, that Death would have been too great an Happiness; that although I could not blame the
            Assembly&rsquo;s <em>Exhortation</em>, or the Urgency of his Friends; yet in my weak and corrupt Judgment, I
            thought it might consist with Reason to have been less rigorous. That, I could not swim a League, and
            probably the nearest Land to theirs might be distant above an Hundred: That, many Materials, necessary for
            making a small Vessel to carry me oﬀ, were wholly wanting in this Country, which however, I would attempt in
            Obedience and Gratitude to his Honour, although I concluded the thing to be impossible, and therefore looked
            on myself as already devoted to Destruction. That, the certain Prospect of an unnatural Death, was the least
            of my Evils: For, supposing I should escape with Life by some strange Adventure, how could I think with
            Temper, of passing my Days among <em>Yahoos,</em> and relapsing into my old Corruptions, for want of
            Examples to lead and keep me within the Paths of Virtue. That, I knew too well upon what solid Reasons all
            the Determinations of the wise <em>Houyhnhnms</em> were founded, not to be shaken by Arguments of mine, a
            miserable <em>Yahoo</em>; and therefore, after presenting him with my humble Thanks for the Oﬀer of his
            Servants Assistance in making a Vessel, and desiring a reasonable Time for so diﬃcult a Work, I told him, I
            would endeavour to preserve a wretched Being; and, if ever I returned to <em>England,</em> was not without
            Hopes of being useful to my own Species, by celebrating the Praises of the renowned* <em>Houyhnhnms,</em>
            and proposing their Virtues to the Imitation of Mankind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Master in a few Words made me a very gracious Reply, allowed me the Space of two <em>Months</em> to finish
            my Boat; and ordered the Sorrel Nag, my Fellow-Servant, (for so at this Distance I may presume to call him)
            to follow my Instructions, because I told my Master, that his Help would be suﬃcient, and I knew he had a
            Tenderness for me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In his Company my first Business was to go to that Part of the Coast, where my rebellious Crew had ordered me
            to be set on Shore. I got upon a Height, and looking on every Side into the Sea, fancied I saw a small
            Island, towards the <em>North-East</em>: I took out my</p>

        <p>Pocket-glass, and could then clearly distinguish it about five Leagues oﬀ, as I computed; but it appeared to
            the Sorrel Nag to be only a blue Cloud: For, as he had no Conception of any Country beside his own, so he
            could not be as expert in distinguishing remote Objects at Sea, as we who so much converse in that Element.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After I had discovered this Island, I considered no farther; but resolved, it should, if possible, be the
            first Place of my Banishment, leaving the Consequence to Fortune.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I returned home, and consulting with the Sorrel Nag, we went into a Copse at some Distance, where I with my
            Knife, and he with a sharp Flint fastened very artificially, after their Manner, to a wooden Handle, cut
            down several oak Wattles* about the Thickness of a Walking-staﬀ, and some larger Pieces. But I shall not
            trouble the Reader with a particular Description of my own Mechanicks: let it suﬃce to say, that in six
            Weeks time, with the Help of the Sorrel Nag, who performed the Parts that required most Labour, I finished a
            Sort of <em>Indian</em> Canoo, but much larger, covering it with the Skins of <em>Yahoos,</em> well stitched
            together, with hempen Threads of my own making. My Sail was likewise composed of the Skins of the same
            Animal; but I made use of the youngest I could get, the older being too tough and thick; and I likewise
            provided myself with four Paddles. I laid in a Stock of boiled Flesh, of Rabbets and Fowls; and took with me
            two Vessels, one filled with Milk, and the other with Water.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I tried my Canoo in a large Pond near my Master&rsquo;s House, and then corrected in it what was amiss;
            stopping all the Chinks with <em>Yahoos</em> Tallow, till I found it stanch,* and able to bear me, and my
            Freight. And when it was as compleat as I could possibly make it, I had it drawn on a Carriage very gently
            by <em>Yahoos,</em> to the Sea-side, under the Conduct of the Sorrel Nag, and another Servant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When all was ready, and the Day came for my Departure, I took Leave of my Master and Lady, and the whole
            Family, mine Eyes flowing with Tears, and my Heart quite sunk with Grief. But his Honour, out of Curiosity,
            and perhaps (if I may speak it without Vanity) partly out of Kindness, was determined to see me in my Canoo;
            and got several of his neighbouring Friends to accompany him. I was forced to wait above an Hour for the
            Tide, and then observing the Wind very fortunately bearing towards the Island, to which I intended to steer
            my Course, I took a second Leave of my</p>

        <p>Master: But as I was going to prostrate myself to kiss his Hoof, he did me the Honour to raise it gently to
            my Mouth.* I am not ignorant how much I have been censured for mentioning this last Particular. Detractors
            are pleased to think it improbable, that so illustrious a Person should descend to give so great a Mark of
            Distinction to a Creature so inferior as I. Neither have I forgot, how apt some Travellers are to boast of
            extraordinary Favours they have received. But, if these Censurers were better acquainted with the noble and
            courteous Disposition of the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, they would soon change their Opinion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I paid my Respects to the rest of the <em>Houyhnhnms</em> in his Honour&rsquo;s Company; then getting into my
            Canoo, I pushed oﬀ from Shore.</p>

        <p><em>The Author&rsquo;s dangerous Voyage. He arrives at</em> New-Holland<em>, hoping to settle there. Is
                wounded with an Arrow by one of the Natives. Is seized and carried by Force into a</em> Portugueze
            <em>Ship. The great Civilities of the Captain. The Author arrives at</em> England<em>.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I b e g a n this desperate Voyage on <em>February</em> 15, 171<u><sup>4</sup></u><sub>5</sub> ,* at 9
            o&rsquo;Clock in the Morning. The Wind was very favourable; however, I made use at first only of my Paddles;
            but considering I should soon be weary, and that the Wind might probably chop about, I ventured to set up my
            little Sail; and thus, with the Help of the Tide, I went at the Rate of a League and a Half an Hour, as near
            as I could guess. My Master and his Friends continued on the Shoar, till I was almost out of Sight; and I
            often heard the Sorrel Nag (who always loved me) crying out, <em>Hnuy illa nyha maiah Yahoo</em>, Take Care
            of thy self, gentle <em>Yahoo.</em></p>
        <p>My Design was, if possible, to discover some small Island uninhabited, yet suﬃcient by my Labour to furnish
            me with Neces-saries of Life, which I would have thought a greater Happiness than to be first Minister in
            the politest Court of <em>Europe</em>; so horrible was the Idea I conceived of returning to live in the
            Society and under the Government of <em>Yahoos.</em> For in such a Solitude* as I desired, I could at least
            enjoy my own Thoughts, and reflect with Delight on the Virtues of those inimitable <em>Houyhnhnms</em>,
            without any Opportun-ity of degenerating into the Vices and Corruptions of my own Species.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Reader may remember what I related when my Crew conspired against me, and confined me to my Cabbin. How I
            continued there several Weeks, without knowing what Course we took; and when I was put ashore in the
            Long-boat, how the Sailors told me with Oaths, whether true or false, that they knew not in what Part of the
            World we were. However, I did then believe us to be about ten Degrees <em>Southward</em> of the <em>Cape of
                Good Hope</em>, or about 45 Degrees <em>Southern</em> Latitude, as I gathered from some general Words I
            over-heard among them, being I supposed to the <em>South-East</em> in their intended Voyage to
            <em>Madagascar.</em> And although this were but little better than Conjecture, yet I resolved to steer my
            Course <em>Eastward</em>,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>266&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>hoping to reach the <em>South-West</em> Coast of <em>New-Holland</em>, and perhaps some such Island as I
            desired, lying <em>Westward</em> of it. The Wind was full <em>West,</em> and by six in the Evening I
            computed I had gone <em>Eastward</em> at least eighteen Leagues; when I spied a very small Island about half
            a League oﬀ, which I soon reached. It was nothing but a Rock with one Creek, naturally arched by the Force
            of Tempests. Here I put in my Canoo, and climbing a Part of the Rock, I could plainly discover Land to the
            <em>East,</em> extending from <em>South</em> to <em>North.</em> I lay all Night in my Canoo; and repeating
            my Voyage early in the Morning, I arrived in seven Hours to the <em>South-East</em> Point of
            <em>New-Holland</em>.* This con-firmed me in the Opinion I have long entertained, that the <em>Maps</em> and
            <em>Charts</em> place this Country at least three Degrees more to the <em>East</em> than it really is;*
            which Thought I communicated many Years ago to my worthy Friend Mr <em>Herman Moll</em>,* and gave him my
            Reasons for it, although he hath rather chosen to follow other Authors.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I saw no Inhabitants in the Place where I landed; and being unarmed, I was afraid of venturing far into the
            Country. I found some Shell-Fish on the Shore, and eat them raw, not daring to kindle a Fire, for fear of
            being discovered by the Natives. I continued three Days feeding on Oysters and Limpets, to save my own
            Provisions; and I fortunately found a Brook of excellent Water, which gave me great Relief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the fourth Day, venturing out early a little too far, I saw twenty or thirty Natives upon a Height, not
            above five hundred Yards from me. They were stark naked, Men, Women and Children round a Fire, as I could
            discover by the Smoke. One of them spied me, and gave Notice to the rest; five of them advanced towards me,
            leaving the Women and Children at the Fire. I made what haste I could to the Shore, and getting into my
            Canoo, shoved oﬀ: The Savages observing me retreat, ran after me; and before I could get far enough into the
            Sea, discharged an Arrow, which wounded me deeply on the Inside of my left Knee* (I shall carry the Mark to
            my Grave.) I apprehended the Arrow might be poisoned; and paddling out of the Reach of their Darts (being a
            calm Day) I made a shift to suck the Wound, and dress it as well as I could.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was at a Loss what to do, for I durst not return to the same Landing-place, but stood to* the
            <em>North</em>, and was forced to paddle; for the Wind, although very gentle, was against me, blowing
            <em>North-West.</em> As I was looking about for a secure Landing-place, I saw a Sail</p>

        <p>to the <em>North North-East</em>, which appearing every Minute more vis-ible, I was in some Doubt, whether I
            should wait for them or no; but at last my Detestation of the <em>Yahoo</em> Race prevailed; and turning my
            Canoo, I sailed and paddled together to the <em>South,</em> and got into the same Creek from whence I set
            out in the Morning; choosing rather to trust my self among these <em>Barbarians</em>, than live with
            <em>European Yahoos</em>. I drew up my Canoo as close as I could to the Shore, and hid my self behind a
            Stone by the little Brook, which, as I have already said, was excellent Water.</p>
        <p>The Ship came within half a League of this Creek, and sent out her Long-Boat with Vessels to take in fresh
            Water (for the Place it seems was very well known) but I did not observe it until the Boat was almost on
            Shore; and it was too late to seek another Hiding-Place. The Seamen at their landing observed my Canoo, and
            rummaging it all over, easily conjectured that the Owner could not be far oﬀ. Four of them well armed
            searched every Cranny and Lurking-hole, till at last they found me flat on my Face behind the Stone. They
            gazed a while in Admiration at my strange uncouth Dress; my Coat made of Skins, my wooden-soaled Shoes, and
            my furred Stockings; from whence, however, they concluded I was not a Native of the Place, who all go naked.
            One of the Seamen in <em>Portugueze</em> bid me rise, and asked who I was. I understood that Language very
            well, and getting upon my Feet, said, I was a poor <em>Yahoo</em>, banished from the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>,
            and desired they would please to let me depart. They admired to hear me answer them in their own Tongue, and
            saw by my Complection I must be an European; but were at a Loss to know what I meant by <em>Yahoos</em> and
            <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, and at the same Time fell a laughing at my strange Tone in speaking, which resembled
            the Neighing of a Horse. I trembled all the while betwixt Fear and Hatred: I again desired Leave to depart,
            and was gently moving to my Canoo; but they laid hold on me, desiring to know what Country I was of ? whence
            I came? with many other Questions. I told them, I was born in <em>England</em>, from whence I came about
            five Years ago, and then their Country and ours were at Peace. I therefore hoped they would not treat me as
            an Enemy, since I meant them no Harm, but was a poor <em>Yahoo</em>, seeking some desolate Place where to
            pass the Remainder of his unfortunate Life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When they began to talk, I thought I never heard or saw any thing so unnatural; for it appeared to me as
            monstrous as if a Dog or a Cow</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>268&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>should speak in <em>England</em>, or a <em>Yahoo</em> in <em>Houyhnhnm-Land</em>. The honest Portuguese were
            equally amazed at my strange Dress, and the odd Manner of delivering my Words, which however they
            under-stood very well. They spoke to me with great Humanity, and said they were sure their Captain would
            carry me <em>gratis</em> to <em>Lisbon</em>, from whence I might return to my own Country; that two of the
            Seamen would go back to the Ship, to inform the Captain of what they had seen, and receive his Orders; in
            the mean Time, unless I would give my solemn Oath not to fly, they would secure me by Force. I thought it
            best to comply with their Proposal. They were very curious to know my Story, but I gave them very little
            Satisfaction; and they all conjectured, that my Misfortunes had impaired my Reason. In two Hours the Boat,
            which went loaden with Vessels of Water, returned with the Captain&rsquo;s Commands to fetch me on Board. I
            fell on my Knees to preserve my Liberty; but all was in vain, and the Men having tied me with Cords, heaved
            me into the Boat, from whence I was taken into the Ship, and from thence into the Captain&rsquo;s Cabbin.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His Name was <em>Pedro de Mendez</em>;* he was a very courteous and generous Person; he entreated me to give
            some Account of my self, and desired to know what I would eat or drink; said, I should be used as well as
            himself, and spoke so many obliging Things, that I wondered to find such Civilities from a <em>Yahoo</em>.
            However, I remained silent and sullen; I was ready to faint at the very Smell of him and his Men. At last I
            desired something to eat out of my own Canoo; but he ordered me a Chicken and some excellent Wine, and then
            directed that I should be put to Bed in a very clean Cabbin. I would not undress my self, but lay on the
            Bed-cloaths; and in half an Hour stole out, when I thought the Crew was at Dinner; and getting to the Side
            of the Ship, was going to leap into the Sea, and swim for my Life, rather than continue among
            <em>Yahoos</em>. But one of the Seamen prevented me, and having informed the Captain, I was chained to my
            Cabbin.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After Dinner <em>Don Pedro</em> came to me, and desired to know my Reason for so desperate an Attempt;
            assured me he only meant to do me all the Service he was able; and spoke so very movingly, that at last I
            descended to treat him like an Animal which had some little Portion of Reason. I gave him a very short
            Relation of my Voyage; of the Conspiracy against me by my own Men; of the Country where</p>

        <p>they set me on Shore, and of my five Years Residence there. All which he looked upon as if it were a Dream or
            a Vision; whereat I took great Oﬀence: For I had quite forgotten the Faculty of Lying, so peculiar to
            <em>Yahoos</em> in all Countries where they preside, and, consequently the Disposition of suspecting Truth
            in others of their own Species. I asked him, Whether it were the Custom of his Country to <em>say the Thing
                that was not?</em> I assured him I almost forgot what he meant by Falshood; and if I had lived a
            thousand Years in <em>Houyhnhnmland</em>, I should never have heard a Lie from the meanest Servant. That I
            was altogether indiﬀerent whether he believed me or no; but however, in return for his Favours, I would give
            so much Allowance to the Corruption of his Nature, as to answer any Objection he would please to make; and
            he might easily discover the Truth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Captain, a wise Man, after many Endeavours to catch me tripping in some Part of my Story, at last began
            to have a better Opinion of my Veracity.* But he added, that since I professed so inviolable an Attachment
            to Truth, I must give him my Word of Honour to bear him Company in this Voyage without attempting any thing
            against my Life; or else he would continue me a Prisoner till we arrived at <em>Lisbon</em>. I gave him the
            Promise he required; but at the same time protested that I would suﬀer the greatest Hardships rather than
            return to live among <em>Yahoos</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our Voyage passed without any considerable Accident. In Gratitude to the Captain I sometimes sate with him at
            his earnest Request, and strove to conceal my Antipathy against human Kind, although it often broke out;
            which he suﬀered to pass without Observation. But the greatest Part of the Day, I confined myself to my
            Cabbin, to avoid seeing any of the Crew. The Captain had often intreated me to strip myself of my savage
            Dress, and oﬀered to lend me the best Suit of Cloaths he had. This I would not be prevailed on to accept,
            abhorring to cover myself with any thing that had been on the Back of a <em>Yahoo</em>. I only desired he
            would lend me two clean Shirts, which having been washed since he wore them, I believed would not so much
            defile me. These I changed every second Day, and washed them myself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We arrived at <em>Lisbon</em>, <em>Nov</em>. 5, 1715. At our landing, the Captain forced me to cover myself
            with his Cloak, to prevent the Rabble from crouding about me. I was conveyed to his own House; and at my</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>270&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>earnest Request, he led me up to the highest Room backwards.* I conjured him to conceal from all Persons what
            I had told him of the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>; because the least Hint of such a Story would not only draw
            Numbers of People to see me, but probably put me in Danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by the
            <em>Inquisition</em>.* The Captain per-suaded me to accept a Suit of Cloaths newly made; but I would not
            suﬀer the Taylor to take my Measure; however, Don <em>Pedro</em> being almost of my Size, they fitted me
            well enough. He accoutred me with other Necessaries all new, which I aired for Twenty-four Hours before I
            would use them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Captain had no Wife, nor above three Servants, none of which were suﬀered to attend at Meals; and his
            whole Deportment was so obliging, added to very good <em>human</em> Understanding, that I really began to
            tolerate his Company. He gained so far upon me, that I ventured to look out of the back Window. By Degrees I
            was brought into another Room, from whence I peeped into the Street, but drew my Head back in a Fright. In a
            Week&rsquo;s Time he seduced me down to the Door. I found my Terror gradually lessened, but my Hatred and
            Contempt seemed to increase. I was at last bold enough to walk the Street in his Company, but kept my Nose
            well stopped with Rue, or sometimes with Tobacco.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In ten Days, Don <em>Pedro</em>, to whom I had given some Account of my domestick Aﬀairs, put it upon me as a
            Point of Honour and Conscience, that I ought to return to my native Country, and live at home with my Wife
            and Children. He told me, there was an <em>English</em> Ship in the Port just ready to sail, and he would
            furnish me with all things necessary. It would be tedious to repeat his Arguments, and my Contradictions. He
            said, it was altogether impossible to find such a solitary Island as I had desired to live in; but I might
            com-mand in my own House, and pass my time in a Manner as recluse as I pleased.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I complied at last, finding I could not do better. I left <em>Lisbon</em> the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>24th Day of <em>November</em>, in an <em>English</em> Merchant-man, but who was the Master I never inquired.
            Don <em>Pedro</em> accompanied me to the Ship, and lent me Twenty Pounds. He took kind Leave of me, and
            embraced me at parting; which I bore as well as I could. During this last Voyage I had no Commerce* with the
            Master, or any of his Men; but pretending I was sick kept close in my Cabbin. On the Fifth of<em>
                December</em>, 1715, we cast Anchor in the <em>Downs</em> about Nine in the</p>

        <p>Morning, and at Three in the Afternoon I got safe to my House at <em>Redri</em><em>ﬀ</em>.</p>
        <p>My Wife and Family received me with great Surprize and Joy, because they concluded me certainly dead; but I
            must freely confess, the Sight of them filled me only with Hatred, Disgust, and Contempt; and the more, by
            reflecting on the near Alliance I had to them. For, although since my unfortunate Exile from the
            <em>Houyhnhnm</em> Country, I had compelled myself to tolerate the Sight of <em>Yahoos</em>, and to
            con-verse with Don <em>Pedro de Mendez</em>; yet my Memory and Imaginations were perpetually filled with the
            Virtues and Ideas of those exalted <em>Houyhnhnms</em>. And when I began to consider, that by copulating
            with one of the <em>Yahoo</em>-Species, I had become a Parent of more; it struck me with the utmost Shame,
            Confusion and Horror.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As soon as I entered the House, my Wife took me in her Arms, and kissed me; at which, having not been used to
            the Touch of that odious Animal for so many Years, I fell in a Swoon for almost an Hour.* At the Time I am
            writing, it is five Years since my last Return to <em>England</em>: During the first Year I could not endure
            my Wife or Children in my Presence, the very Smell of them was intolerable; much less could I suﬀer them to
            eat in the same Room. To this Hour they dare not presume to touch my Bread, or drink out of the same Cup;
            neither was I ever able to let one of them take me by the Hand.* The first Money I laid out was to buy two
            young Stone-Horses,* which I keep in a good Stable, and next to them the Groom is my greatest Favourite; for
            I feel my Spirits revived by the Smell he contracts in the Stable. My Horses understand me tolerably well; I
            converse with them at least four Hours every Day. They are Strangers to Bridle or Saddle; they live in great
            Amity with me, and Friendship to each other.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>T h u s , gentle Reader, I have given thee a faithful History* of my Travels for Sixteen Years, and above
            Seven Months; wherein I have not been so studious of Ornament as of Truth. I could perhaps like others have
            astonished thee with strange improbable Tales; but I rather chose to relate plain Matter of Fact in the
            simplest Manner and Style; because my principal Design was to inform, and not to amuse thee.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is easy for us who travel into remote Countries, which are seldom visited by <em>Englishmen</em> or other
            <em>Europeans</em>, to form Descriptions of wonderful Animals both at Sea and Land. Whereas, a
            Traveller&rsquo;s chief Aim should be to make Men wiser and better, and to improve their Minds by the bad,
            as well as good Example of what they deliver concerning foreign Places.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I could heartily wish a Law was enacted, that every Traveller, before he were permitted to publish his
            Voyages, should be obliged to make Oath before the <em>Lord High Chancellor</em>, that all he intended to
            print was absolutely true to the best of his Knowledge; for then the World would no longer be deceived as it
            usually is, while some Writers, to make their Works pass the better upon the Publick, impose the grossest
            Falsities on the unwary Reader. I have perused several Books of Travels with great Delight in my younger
            Days; but, having since gone over most Parts of the Globe, and been able to contradict many fabulous
            Accounts from my own Observation; it hath given me a great Disgust against this Part of Reading, and some
            Indignation to see the Credulity of Mankind so impudently abused. Therefore since my Acquaintance were
            pleased to think my poor Endeavours might not be unacceptable to my Country; I imposed on</p>

        <p>myself as a Maxim, never to be swerved from, that I would <em>strictly adhere to Truth</em>; neither indeed
            can I be ever under the least Temptation to vary from it, while I retain in my Mind the Lectures and Example
            of my noble Master, and the other illustrious <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, of whom I had so long the Honour to be an
            humble Hearer.</p>

        <p>I know very well, how little Reputation is to be got by Writings which require neither Genius nor Learning,
            nor indeed any other Talent, except a good Memory, or an exact <em>Journal</em>.* I know likewise that
            Writers of Travels, like <em>Dictionary-</em>Makers, are sunk into Oblivion by the Weight and Bulk of those
            who come last, and there-fore lie uppermost: And it is highly probable, that such Travellers who shall
            hereafter visit the Countries described in this Work of mine, may by detecting my Errors, (if there be any)
            and adding many new Discoveries of their own, jostle me out of Vogue, and stand in my Place; making the
            World forget that I was ever an Author. This indeed would be too great a Mortification if I wrote for Fame:
            But, as my sole Intention was the PUBLICK GOOD, I cannot be altogether disappointed. For, who can read of
            the Virtues I have mentioned in the glorious <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, without being ashamed of his own Vices,
            when he considers himself as the reasoning, governing Animal of his Country? I shall say nothing of those
            remote Nations where <em>Yahoos</em> preside; amongst which the least corrupted are the
            <em>Brobdingnagians</em>, whose wise Maxims in Morality and Government, it would be our Happiness to
            observe. But I forbear descanting further, and rather leave the judicious Reader to his own Remarks and
            Applications.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am not a little pleased that this Work of mine can possibly meet with no Censurers: For what Objections can
            be made against a Writer who relates only plain Facts that happened in such distant Countries, where we have
            not the least Interest with respect either to Trade or Negotiations? I have carefully avoided every Fault
            with which common Writers of Travels are often too justly charged. Besides, I meddle not the least with any
            <em>Party</em>, but write without Passion, Prejudice, or Ill-will against any Man or Number of Men
            whatsoever. I write for the noblest End, to inform and instruct</p>

        <p>Mankind, over whom I may, without Breach of Modesty, pretend to some Superiority, from the Advantages I
            received by conversing so long among the most accomplished <em>Houyhnhnms</em>. I write without any View
            towards Profit or Praise. I never suﬀer a Word to pass that may look like Reflection, or possibly give the
            least Oﬀence even to those who are most ready to take it. So that, I hope, I may with Justice pronounce
            myself an Author perfectly blameless; against whom the Tribes of Answerers, Considerers, Observers,
            Reflecters, Detecters, Remarkers, will never be able to find Matter for exercising their Talents.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I confess, it was whispered to me, that I was bound in Duty as a Subject of <em>England</em>, to have given
            in a Memorial to a Secretary of State, at my first coming over; because, whatever Lands are dis-covered by a
            Subject, belong to the Crown. But I doubt, whether our Conquests in the Countries I treat of, would be as
            easy as those of <em>Ferdinando Cortez</em>* over the naked <em>Americans</em>. The <em>Lilliputians</em> I
            think, are hardly worth the Charge of a Fleet and Army to reduce them; and I question whether it might be
            prudent or safe to attempt the <em>Brobdingnagians</em>: Or, whether an <em>English</em> Army would be much
            at their Ease with the Flying Island over their Heads. The <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, indeed, appear not to be so
            well prepared for war, a Science to which they are perfect Strangers, and especially against missive
            Weapons.* However, supposing myself to be a Minister of State, I could never give my Advice for invading
            them. Their Prudence, Unanimity, Unacquaintedness with Fear, and their Love of their Country would amply
            supply all Defects in the military Art. Imagine twenty Thousand of them breaking into the Midst of an
            <em>European</em> Army, confounding the Ranks, overturning the Carriages, battering the Warriors Faces into
            Mummy,* by terrible Yerks* from their hinder Hoofs: For they would well deserve the Character given to
            <em>Augustus</em>; <em>Recalcitrat undique tutus.</em>* But instead of Proposals for conquering that
            magnanimous Nation, I rather wish they were in a Capacity or Disposition to send a suﬃcient Number of their
            Inhabitants for civilizing <em>Europe</em>; by teaching us the first Principles of Honour, Justice, Truth,
            Temperance, publick Spirit, Fortitude, Chastity, Friendship, Benevolence, and Fidelity. The <em>Names</em>
            of all which Virtues are still retained among us in most Languages, and are to be met with in modern as well
            as ancient Authors; which I am able to assert from my own small Reading.</p>

        <p>But, I had another Reason which made me less forward to enlarge his Majesty&rsquo;s Dominions by my
            Discoveries: To say the Truth, I had conceived a few Scruples with relation to the distributive* Just-ice of
            Princes upon those Occasions. For Instance, A Crew of Pyrates are driven by a Storm they know not whither;
            at length a Boy discovers Land from the Top-mast; they go on Shore to rob and plunder; they see an harmless
            People, are entertained with Kindness, they give the Country a new Name, they take formal Possession of it
            for the King, they set up a rotten Plank or a Stone for a Memorial, they murder two or three Dozen of the
            Natives, bring away a Couple more by Force for a Sample, return home, and get their Pardon. Here commences a
            new Dominion acquired with a Title by <em>Divine Right</em>. Ships are sent with the first Opportunity; the
            Natives driven out or destroyed, their Princes tortured to discover their Gold;* a free Licence given to all
            Acts of Inhumanity and Lust; the Earth reeking with the Blood of its Inhabitants: And this execrable Crew of
            Butchers employed in so pious an Expedition, is a <em>modern Colony</em> sent to convert* and civilize an
            idolatrous and barbarous People.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But this Description,* I confess, doth by no means aﬀect the <em>British</em> Nation, who may be an Example
            to the whole World for their Wisdom, Care, and Justice in planting Colonies; their liberal Endowments* for
            the Advancement of Religion and Learning; their Choice of devout and able Pastors to propagate
            <em>Christianity</em>; their Caution in stocking their Provinces with People of sober Lives and
            Conversations from this the Mother Kingdom; their strict Regard to the Distribution of Justice, in supplying
            the Civil Administration through all their Colonies with Oﬃcers of the greatest Abilities, utter Strangers
            to Corruption: And to crown all, by sending the most vigilant and virtuous Governors, who have no other
            Views than the Happiness of the People over whom they preside, and the Honour of the King their Master.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, as those Countries which I have described do not appear to have a Desire of being conquered, and
            enslaved, murdered or driven out by Colonies; nor abound either in Gold, Silver, Sugar or Tobacco; I did
            humbly conceive they were by no Means proper Objects of our Zeal, our Valour, or our Interest. However, if
            those whom it more concerns, think fit to be of another Opinion, I am ready to depose, when I shall be
            lawfully called, That no <em>European</em></p>

        <p>276&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>did ever visit these Countries before me. I mean, if the Inhabitants ought to be believed.*</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, as to the Formality of taking Possession in my Sovereign&rsquo;s Name, it never came once into my
            Thoughts; and if it had, yet as my Aﬀairs then stood, I should perhaps in point of Prudence and
            Self-Preservation have, put it oﬀ to a better Opportunity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having thus answered the <em>only</em> Objection that can be raised against me as a Traveller; I here take a
            final Leave of my Courteous Readers, and return to enjoy my own Speculations in my little Garden at
            <em>Redri</em><em>ﬀ</em>; to apply those excellent Lessons of Virtue which I learned among the
            <em>Houyhnhnms</em>; to instruct the <em>Yahoos</em> of my own Family as far as I shall find them docible
            Animals; to behold my Figure often in a Glass, and thus if possible habituate my self by Time to tolerate
            the Sight of a human Creature: To lament the Brutality of <em>Houyhnhnms</em> in my own Country, but always
            treat their Persons with Respect, for the Sake of my noble Master, his Family, his Friends, and the whole
            <em>Houyhnhnm</em> Race, whom these of ours have the Honour to resemble in all their Lineaments, however
            their Intellectuals came to degenerate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I began last Week to permit my Wife to sit at Dinner with me, at the farthest End of a long Table; and to
            answer (but with the utmost Brevity) the few Questions I asked her. Yet the Smell of a <em>Yahoo</em>
            continuing very oﬀensive, I always keep my Nose well stopt with Rue, Lavender, or Tobacco-Leaves. And
            although it be hard for a Man late in Life to remove old Habits; I am not altogether out of Hopes in some
            Time to suﬀer a Neighbour <em>Yahoo</em> in my Company, without the Apprehensions I am yet under of his
            Teeth or his Claws.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Reconcilement to the <em>Yahoo-</em>kind in general might not be so diﬃcult, if they would be content with
            those Vices and Follies only which Nature hath entitled them to. I am not in the least provoked at the Sight
            of a Lawyer, a Pick-pocket, a Colonel, a Fool, a Lord, a Gamester, a Politician, a Whoremunger, a Physician,
            an Evidence,* a Suborner, an Attorney, a Traytor, or the like: This is all according to the due Course of
            Things: But, when I behold a Lump of Deformity, and Diseases both in Body and Mind, smitten with
            <em>Pride</em>, it immedi-ately breaks all the Measures of my Patience; neither shall I ever be able to
            comprehend how such an Animal and such a Vice could tally together. The wise and virtuous
            <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, who abound in all Excellencies that can adorn a rational Creature, have no Name for</p>

        <p>this Vice in their Language, which hath no Terms to express any thing that is evil, except those whereby they
            describe the detestable Qualities of their <em>Yahoos</em>; among which they were not able to distinguish
            this of Pride, for want of thoroughly understanding Human Nature, as it sheweth it self in other Countries,
            where that Animal presides. But I, who had more Experience, could plainly observe some Rudiments of it among
            the wild <em>Yahoos</em>.</p>
        <p>But the <em>Houyhnhnms</em>, who live under the Government of Reason, are no more proud of the good Qualities
            they possess, than I should be for not wanting a Leg or an Arm, which no Man in his Wits would boast of,
            although he must be miserable without them. I dwell the longer upon this Subject from the Desire I have to
            make the Society of an <em>English Yahoo</em> by any Means not insupportable; and therefore I here intreat
            those who have any Tincture of this absurd Vice, that they will not presume to appear in my Sight.*</p>

        <p>EXPLANATORY NOTES</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The notes in this edition are indebted to Paul Turner, editor of the Oxford University Press edition of
            <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> in 1971 (published as a World&rsquo;s Classics paperback in 1986). Paul
            Turner&rsquo;s notes are the basis for the annota-tion in this new edition and many of Turner&rsquo;s
            glosses, and extensive notes (identified as PT) remain unchanged or only slightly altered here. There is a
            vast scholarly commentary on <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> and its contexts, and many sources,
            analogues, and allusions have been discovered. A comprehensive handbook of Swift&rsquo;s library and reading
            identifying where Swift is known to have quoted from, referred to, or alluded to an author in his writings
            is Dirk F. Passmann and Heinz J. Vienken, <em>The Library and Reading of Jonathan Swift: A
                Bio-Bibliographical Handbook</em> (Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, 2003&ndash; ). These notes attempt to
            focus on essential explanation indicating sources, allu-sions, and analogues which seem particularly germane
            to an understanding of the meaning and resonance of a passage. Words and phrases defined in standard
            dictionaries such as the <em>Concise Oxford Dictionary</em> are not normally glossed here.</p>

        <p><em>Interpolations . . . made by a Person since deceased</em>: Swift complained that the Reverend Andrew
            Tooke (d. 1732), a silent partner and mentor of the London publisher Benjamin Motte, had altered the
            manuscript of the<em> Travels</em> before publication. In October 1733, preparing for the new edi-tion to be
            published in Dublin by George Faulkner, Swift reminded his friend Charles Ford &lsquo;how much I complained
            of Motts suﬀering some friend of his (I suppose it was M<sup>r</sup> Took a Clergy-man now dead) not onely
            to blot out some things that he thought might give oﬀence, but to insert a good deal of trash contrary to
            the Author&rsquo;s manner and Style, and Intention&rsquo; (<em>Corr.</em>, iii. 693. For Swift&rsquo;s
            complaints that his satire in the first edition of 1726 had been altered by Motte and Tooke, see also
            <em>Corr.</em>, iii. 57, 66&ndash;69, 708)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>compliment the Memory</em>: Part IV, chapter vi of Motte&rsquo;s first edition con-tains an extended
            passage that was cut from the revised edition pub-lished by Faulkner in Dublin in 1735. The passage contains
            a panegyric of Queen Anne that is also a transparent attack by innuendo on the honour of King George I and
            imputes a connection between the monarch and his corrupt ministry. The passage was specifically dis-claimed
            as an interpolated paragraph by Charles Ford, writing to Motte, as a friend of the author, on 3 January 1727
            (<em>Corr.</em>, iii. 66). In &lsquo;A Letter from Capt. Gulliver, to his Cousin Sympson&rsquo;, Swift has
            Gulliver &lsquo;renounce&rsquo; all interpolations, &lsquo;particularly a Paragraph about her Majesty the
            late Queen <em>Anne</em>&rsquo;. The chapter heading in the Motte edition provoca-tively praised Queen Anne,
            reading in part: &lsquo;<em>A Continuation of the State</em> <em>of</em> England, <em>so well governed by a
                Queen as to need no</em><em> fi</em><em>rst Minister</em>&rsquo;. The &lsquo;interpolation&rsquo; reads
            as follows: &lsquo;I t o l d him, that our She Governor or Queen having no Ambition to gratify, no
            Inclination to satisfy of extend-ing her Power to the Injury of her Neighbours, or the Prejudice of her own
            Subjects, was therefore so far from needing a corrupt Ministry to carry on or cover any sinister Designs,
            that She not only directs her own Actions to the Good of her People, conducts them by the Direction, and
            restrains them within the Limitation of the Laws of her own Country; but submits the Behaviour and Acts of
            those She intrusts with the Administration of Her Aﬀairs to the Examination of Her great Council, and
            subjects them to the Penalties of the Law; and therefore never puts any such Confidence in any of her
            Subjects as to entrust them with the whole and entire Administration of her Aﬀairs: But I added, that in
            some former Reigns here, and in many other Courts of <em>Europe</em> now, where Princes grew indolent and
            careless of their own Aﬀairs through a constant Love and Pursuit of Pleasure, they made use of such an
            Administrator, as I had mentioned, under the Title of <em>fi</em><em>rst</em> or <em>chief</em> <em>Minister
                of State</em>, the Description of which, as far as it may be collected</p>

        <p>not only from their Actions, but from the Letters, Memoirs, and Writ-ings published by themselves, the Truth
            of which has not yet been disputed, may be allowed to be as follows: That he is a Person&rsquo; (<em>PW</em>
            xi. 318). Approval of Queen Anne would certainly have been objectionable to the Hanoverian Whig government
            which had prosecuted the leaders of Queen Anne&rsquo;s Tory ministry for treason. The prosecutions of
            Jacobite publicists during the reigns of George I and II show that the Whig government was willing and able
            to punish reflections on the ruling dynasty. It seems unlikely that Motte would have inserted a passage that
            increased the oﬀensiveness of Swift&rsquo;s satire and the risk of prosecution by attacking the King as well
            as his &lsquo;<em>First</em> or <em>Chief Minister of State</em>&rsquo;. The awkwardly composed passage may
            well have been Tooke&rsquo;s inadequate attempt to soften the anti-Hanoverian satire he may have found in
            Swift&rsquo;s original manuscript. In Faulkner&rsquo;s 1735 edition the scathing sat-ire is aimed at Robert
            Walpole as &lsquo;<em>First</em> or <em>Chief Minister of State</em>&rsquo; not, as in 1726, at the King and
            Walpole.</p>

        <p><em>a very worthy Gentleman</em>: Swift&rsquo;s friend Charles Ford, whose interleaved copy of the first
            edition of <em>GT</em> with manuscript corrections in his hand is now in the National Art Library in the
            Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</p>

        <p><em>Book in Sheets</em>: books were often bought with the pages unbound.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>7 <em>Gulliver</em>: the choice of name for the putative author of the <em>Travels </em>seems to have been
            made at a late stage. Swift first names Lemuel Gulliver in a letter to Benjamin Motte of 8 August 1726 (see
            <em>Corr.</em>, iii. 9&ndash;12). The name Captain Lemuel Gulliver appears in the paratexts of the book (on
            the frontispiece, title-page, Advertisement, &lsquo;The Publisher to the Reader&rsquo;, and in this
            prefatory Letter to Sympson) but the voyager is not named in the main text. The first name
            &lsquo;Lemuel&rsquo;, which means &lsquo;dedicated to God&rsquo; in Hebrew, may allude to the biblical King
            Lemuel (Proverbs 31: 1&ndash;9). The prophetic words of King Lemuel in Proverbs might be thought relevant to
            some of the targets of Swift&rsquo;s satire. They include: &lsquo;Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy
            ways to that which destroyeth kings&rsquo; (31: 3); &lsquo;Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all
            such as are appointed to destruction&rsquo; (31: 8); and &lsquo;Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead
            the cause of the poor and needy&rsquo; (31: 9). The view of King Lemuel in Proverbs 31: 6, 7: &lsquo;Give
            strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts&rsquo;;
            &lsquo;Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more&rsquo; was shared by Swift (a
            wine lover) in his Irish pamphleteering against an additional duty on wine. Swift argued that wine is
            essential for the singularly impoverished and miserable Irish people, it was the only thing that made life
            in Hanoverian Ireland endurable: &lsquo;there is no nation yet known, in either hemisphere, where the people
            of all conditions are more in want of some cordial, to keep up their spirits, than in this of ours. I am not
            in jest&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> xii. 124). Swift, also like King Lemuel (Proverbs 31: 4&ndash;5), could warn
            against strong drink, and Gulliver under Houyhnhnm</p>

        <p>influence in Part IV, chapter vi attacks the use of wine because it puts people out of their senses.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first syllable of Lemuel&rsquo;s last name, Gulliver, might suggest the character&rsquo;s gullibility. A
            &lsquo;gull&rsquo; is a dupe or fool. The final syllable &lsquo;ver&rsquo; might signify veracity or truth.
            Gulliver is &lsquo;the dupe of truth&rsquo;, the cipher of the truth-telling satirist (see Cecil C. Seronsy,
            &lsquo;Some Proper Names in &ldquo;Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels&rdquo;&rsquo; , <em>N&amp;Q</em> 202 (1957),

            <li><em>Sympson</em>: the pseudonym used by Swift when negotiating with Motte before and after the
                publication of <em>GT</em>. Swift has given a fictitious after-life to a real Richard Sympson, one of
                the copyright holders of Sir William Temple&rsquo;s writings which Swift had edited and prepared for the
                press in the 1690s. Richard Sympson has become Gulliver&rsquo;s cousin, copy-editor, and agent (see , i.
                119, n. 4). The name is probably also part of the joke that Gulliver is a fiction and <em>GT</em> is a
                mock travel book. Sympson might be recalling William Symson, the fictitious author of <em>A</em> <em>New
                    Voyage to the East-Indies</em> (1715) which was a plagiarism from an earlier travel book. This
                spurious voyage book is one of the sources Swift draws upon in <em>GT</em> (see R. W. Frantz,
                &lsquo;Gulliver&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cousin Sympson&rdquo;&rsquo; ,</li>

        <p><em>A Letter from Capt. Gulliver to His Cousin Sympson</em>. First published in 1735 but apparently intended
            for an earlier revised second edition in 1727. The Letter is dated &lsquo;<em>April</em> 2, 1727&rsquo;, the
            day after April Fool&rsquo;s Day, perhaps a wry reference to the fact that this travel book is a hoax. Swift
            pulled oﬀ some brilliant April Fool&rsquo;s Day hoaxes during his career. It was an important date in his
            calendar.</p>

        <p><em>Dampier</em>: William Dampier (1652&ndash;1715), naval captain, buccaneer, privateer, circumnavigator,
            hydrographer, and author. His voyage writ-ings, such as <em>A New Voyage Round the World</em> (1697)
            mentioned here, are among the travel books parodied by Swift. Dampier admitted that what he wrote was
            corrected by friends (<em>Voyages</em>, ii. 342).</p>

        <p><em>Inuendo (as I think you called it.)</em>: as defined in the <em>OED</em> an innuendo is an oblique hint,
            indirect suggestion; an allusive remark concerning a person or thing, especially of a depreciatory kind. It
            was a legal term for the construction put upon a word or expression, especially an injurious or libellous
            meaning or signification alleged of words not in themselves injurious or actionable. It was very much a
            vogue term for what the government regarded as seditious indirect hints and allusions. In a work attributed
            to Daniel Defoe an &lsquo;<em>Innuendo</em>&rsquo; is described as &lsquo;a rare new<em>
                Law-</em><em>fi</em><em>gure</em>&rsquo; used in Charles II&rsquo;s reign (<em>An Account of the Late

            29&ndash;30). The Walpolean Administration was said to be destroying the liberty of the press in its
            punishment of writers allegedly using seditious and treasonable innuendo (see <em>The Doctrine of
                Innuendo&rsquo;s</em> <em>Discuss&rsquo;d, or the Liberty of the Press Maintain&rsquo;d: Being some

            explanatory keys, pamphlet attacks, continuations, and adaptations. The list of &lsquo;Gulliveriana&rsquo;
            given in the standard Teerink-Scouten bibliography (see Teerink, 244&ndash;52; 34 items up to 1735) vastly
            understates the phenomenal response to <em>GT</em>. For a comprehensive record, see Jeanne K. Welcher (ed.),

            <li><em>confound the Times</em>: Gulliver&rsquo;s complaints are a typical author&rsquo;s cant, blaming the

                discrepancies in the times and dates which were almost certainly the result of Swift&rsquo;s own
                carelessness. The time scheme in Faulkner&rsquo;s 1735 edition is generally consistent. On this textual

        <p>manuscript, was destroyed by Motte, thus removing incriminating evidence, a routine practice among
            eighteenth-century publishers, espe-cially of politically sensitive works. Swift&rsquo;s holograph, in the
            safe custody of his friend Charles Ford, seems to have survived into the second half of the eighteenth
            century, see David Woolley, &lsquo;The Stemma of <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>: A Second Note&rsquo;,

        <p><em>nor now in Use</em>: indeed, as Swift largely took the nautical language from Samuel Sturmy&rsquo;s

        <p><em>Utopia</em>: the word was first coined by Sir Thomas More as the name for the imaginary island described
            in his book of 1516. &lsquo;Utopia&rsquo; means &lsquo;no place&rsquo;, but the word also puns on
            &lsquo;eutopia&rsquo;, meaning happy or fortunate place, and has come to mean a perfect society. Sir Thomas
            More&rsquo;s<em> Utopia</em> (1516) is one of Swift&rsquo;s sources. More&rsquo;s Utopians like
            Swift&rsquo;s Houyhnhnms live according to reason and nature. Swift&rsquo;s Houyhnhnmland like More&rsquo;s
            Utopia exhibits, at least for many modern readers, both attractive and unattractive features. No one starves
            there but there is little personal freedom.</p>

        <p><em>Banbury</em>: the town of Banbury in Oxfordshire was associated with Puritan fanaticism. Swift refers to
            &lsquo;a <em>Banbury Saint</em>&rsquo; in his satire on Puritan Enthusiasm in <em>A Discourse Concerning the
                Mechanical Operation</em> <em>of the Spirit</em> (<em>PW</em> i. 184). PT notes that several Gulliver
            tombstones are still legible in the churchyard of St Mary&rsquo;s, and the parish register records the
            burial of a Samuel Gulliver on 17 Aug. 1728. Like Lemuel, Samuel was an innkeeper, and the name of his inn,
            the &lsquo;Dolphin&rsquo; (on the south side of the Horsefair), had associations with seafaring.
            Samuel&rsquo;s wife, like Lemuel&rsquo;s daughter, was called Elizabeth. There is a local trad-ition that
            Swift once lodged on the opposite side of the Horsefair, prob-ably at &lsquo;The Three Tuns&rsquo;, the
            principal inn at Banbury during the eight-eenth century. He may have passed through the town in the summer
            of 1726, on his way to visit his old friend William Rollinson, whose family home was at Chadlington, about
            15 miles south-west of Banbury. PT (see<em> Corr.</em>, iii. 7 n. 2; 11 n. 1).</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Lilliput</em>: there have been ingenious attempts to decipher the fictional place names and
                languages in <em>GT</em>. Many of these suggested decodings are recorded in the explanatory notes of
                Paul Turner&rsquo;s Oxford edition of<em> GT</em> and in studies such as Paul Odell Clark, &lsquo;A
                Gulliver Dictionary&rsquo;,<em> Studies in Philology</em>, 50 (1953), 592&ndash;624. While many of
                Swift&rsquo;s invented words may teasingly suggest puns, anagrams, and language games involv-ing letter
                substitutions, on the whole, the invented words and languages seem to be mainly delightful nonsense.
                Swift&rsquo;s linguistic playfulness on display in <em>GT</em> is also evidenced in the &lsquo;little
                language&rsquo; used in his corres-pondence with Esther Johnson (known as the <em>Journal to
                    Stella</em>, see <em>PW</em> xv and xvi) and in the punning language games he enjoyed with his
                friend Thomas Sheridan. <em>GT</em> has given several words to the language, including
                &lsquo;lilliputian&rsquo; meaning a little or diminutive person or thing.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>an average Englishman: the middle son of a father of middling social estate, born in the English midlands. He
            is educated at a Cambridge college of Puritan foundation implying perhaps that he is solidly Whiggish and
            Protestant. The opening reads like a parody of the manner of voyage authors reporting personal details, and
            of the start of the Protestant Dissenter Daniel Defoe&rsquo;s <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> in particular.
            Defoe&rsquo;s fictional voyage hero is also a third son.</p>

            England.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Swallow</em>: with the exception of the Dutch ship the &lsquo;Amboyna&rsquo; in Part III, all of
            Gulliver&rsquo;s ships have the names recorded of real contemporary ships in the <em>Calendar of Treasury
                Books</em> (Quinlan, 412&ndash;17) and in the huge voyage collections of Richard Hakluyt and Samuel
            Purchas (Real/ Vienken, 518&ndash;19). Swift&rsquo;s library contained Hakluyt&rsquo;s <em>Principal
                Naviga-tions</em> (either in the 1589 or the 1598&ndash;1600 edition, see <em>Library</em>, Part I, vol.
            ii, 778&ndash;83) and <em>Hakluytus Posthumous, or Purchas His Pilgrimes</em> (1625, see <em>Library</em>,
            Part I, vol. ii, 1546&ndash;51). Ships called <em>Swallow</em>, <em>Adventure</em>,<em> Antelope</em>, and
            <em>Hopewell</em> are recorded several times in a number of London newspapers in the single month of August
            1722 (Real/Vienken, 519). A &lsquo;<em>Swallow</em>, was among the vessels with which Sir John Hawkins
            conducted a profitable slave trade in Guinea in the 1560s&rsquo; and other ships with this name are
            mentioned in Purchas (Real/Vienken, 518) and in the <em>Calendar</em> <em>of Treasury Books</em> (Quinlan,

            estimated that a contemporary eighteenth-century tradesman&rsquo;s family and servants could live
            comfortably for a year on about &pound;350. Gulliver as a student in Leiden was expected to maintain himself
            on &lsquo;Thirty Pounds a Year&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>I married . . . Portion</em>: possibly a veiled reference to Defoe, who had started life as a hosier,
            married an heiress called Mary Tuﬄey, rapidly spent her dowry of nearly &pound;4,000, and passed five months
            in Newgate Prison. PT. Swift aﬀected not to know Defoe&rsquo;s name, referring to the notorious Dissenter
            and Whig author in one pamphlet as &lsquo;the Fellow that was <em>pilloryed</em>, I have forgot his
            Name&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> ii. 113).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Master Bates</em>: it is sometimes suggested that the possible pun on the surgeon&rsquo;s name,
            elaborately built up with earlier references to &lsquo;Mr <em>James</em> <em>Bates</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;Mr
            <em>Bates</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;my good Master Mr <em>Bates</em>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Mr <em>Bates</em>, my
            Mas-ter&rsquo;, alludes to the panic about masturbation generated by sensational contemporary publications
            such as the best-selling <em>Onania, or The Hein-ous Sin of Self-Pollution, and All Its Frightful
                Consequences, in Both Sexes, Considered</em> (in its eighth edition in 1723). The concern about
            &lsquo;Masturba-tion&rsquo; among young men is amusingly exploited in Bernard Mandeville&rsquo;s</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>A Modest Defence of Public Stews</em> (London, 1724): &lsquo;they are every Day committing <em>Rapes</em>
            upon their own Bodies&rsquo; with &lsquo;the Agility of their Wrists&rsquo; and &lsquo;laying <em>violent
                Hands</em> upon themselves&rsquo; (pp. 30, 31). The reader may already be beginning to suspect that this
            voyage book will be giving details not found in real voyage books or in fictional works like Defoe&rsquo;s
            <em>Robinson Crusoe</em>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>I was Surgeon . . . to the East and West-Indies . . . Addition to my Fortune</em>: Gulliver is vague

        <p>Gulliver&rsquo;s shipwreck and misfortunes in the South Seas an allusion to the South Sea Bubble, a financial
            market crash in 1720 which saw a specula-tive boom in South Sea stock collapse, citing Swift&rsquo;s satiric
            poem &lsquo;The Bubble&rsquo; where the bankrupt &lsquo;plunges in the Southern waves&rsquo; (line 23, see

            <li><em>when I awaked</em>: Gulliver is perhaps imagined like Hercules being attacked by pygmies
                (Philostratus, <em>Imagines</em>, ii. 22) or like Samson being bound and imprisoned (Judges 15: 14; 16:
                7&ndash;30). The Philistines &lsquo;put out&rsquo; Samson&rsquo;s eyes, the Lilliputians later plan such
                a fate for Gulliver.</li>

        <p><em>not six Inches high</em>: Lilliputians are one-twelfth the size of humans, the scale of proportion in
            Lilliput is one to twelve, and since we are three dimensional, humans are therefore 1,728 times as large as
            Lilliputians. The scale is reversed in Brobdingnag, twelve to one. Powerfully used by Swift for purposes of
            satiric reduction and aggrandisement, the use of and interest in perspective also reflect the recent
            discovery of the microscope and the telescope.</p>

            Beheaded&rsquo; (<em>Key</em>, Part I, pp. 7&ndash;8). Swift venerated the &lsquo;memory of that excellent
            King and blessed Martyr CHARLES I&rsquo; describing the regicide in 1649 as a murder, for example, in a
            sermon preached in 1726, the year of the publication of <em>GT</em> (see <em>PW</em> ix. 219&ndash;31). The
            allusion to the martyrdom of Charles I is a sign of the political satire&rsquo;s High Church Tory rather
            than dissident Old Whig prov-enance as Old Whigs hated the Stuart king. Swift also honoured the memory of
            the executed Earl of Straﬀord &lsquo;that illustrious Earl who dyed to preserve The Church, his King and the
            old Constitution, so shattered and crazy almost ever since&rsquo; (see Hermann J. Real, &lsquo;A New Letter

        <p><em>His Features</em>: the description of the Emperor of Lilliput&rsquo;s features is a sardonic allusion to

        <p><em>Austrian Lip</em>: the thick underlip typical of the Habsburgs. George was neither Austrian nor a

            of Austria (see e.g. [Matthias Earbery], <em>An Historical</em> <em>Account of the Advantages that have
                Accrued to England by the Succession in the Illustrious House of Hanover, Part II</em> (London, 1722),

                Tindal&rsquo;s <em>The Rights of the Christian</em> <em>Church</em>: &lsquo;Put the Case, that walking

        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Flimnap</em>: this satiric paradigm of a Royal favourite and first minister was seen by contemporaries as
            alluding to the Whig statesman Robert Walpole, Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1715 and a principal champion
            of the post-1688 settlement and supporter of the Hanoverian dynasty. Walpole took a severe line on Jacobite
            disaﬀection, vigorously pursuing Queen Anne&rsquo;s Tory ministers for treason, was active in the
            suppression of the 1715 Jacobite Rising, and led proceedings against Francis Atterbury, the Bishop of
            Rochester, for Jacobite conspiracy in 1722&ndash;3. Although he lost power during the Whig split of 1717, he
            emerged after the South Sea crisis in 1720 and following the deaths of the Whig leaders Sunderland and
            Stanhope in 1721&ndash;2 as the leading Whig minister. He was, in eﬀect, the Whig prime minister of both
            George I and George II from 1721&ndash;2 to 1742. His political management secured the Hanoverian dynasty
            through a number of crises (including the controversy over the aﬀair of Wood&rsquo;s halfpence in which
            Swift was one of Walpole&rsquo;s principal Irish polemical antagonists) and maintained Whig hegemony and the
            Tory party&rsquo;s proscription from oﬃce. Swift opposed him on religious, political, economic, and Irish
            issues. In an explicit, unpublished political allegory, <em>An Account of the Court and Empire of Japan</em>
            (written in 1728),</p>

            <em>Explanatory Notes</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Swift satirized Walpole&rsquo;s government as arbitrary and corrupt and referred to Walpole as
            &lsquo;perfectly skilled, by long practice&rsquo; in parlia-mentary management &lsquo;and dextrous in the
            purchasing of votes&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> v. 101), recalling the references to Flimnap&rsquo;s skill and
            dexterity in <em>GT</em>. The Opposition press alluded to Walpole as a brazen man who made
            &lsquo;<em>Britannia</em>&rsquo; turn &lsquo;<em>Rope-Dancer</em>&rsquo; (<em>Robin&rsquo;s Panegyrick. Or,
                The Norfolk Miscellany</em> (London, [1729]), 81&ndash;4).</p>

        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Reldresal</em>: a type of the false friend and trimming politician, identified in modern commentary with
            various Whigs who, unlike Walpole, some-times seemed disposed either to the Tories or to Swift: Lord
            Carteret, a Whig Secretary of State and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and the Earl of Stanhope, head of the
            Whig government in 1717&ndash;21 and a rival to Walpole, have been suggested. The <em>Key</em> linked
            Flimnap and Reldresal with Walpole and Lord Townshend, a Whig Secretary of State and Walpole&rsquo;s close
            political ally in the 1720s although their relationship deteriorated (<em>Key</em>, Part I, p. 13).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>one of the King&rsquo;s Cushions</em>: in the fifth <em>Drapier&rsquo;s Letter</em> (1724), an
                eastern king is said to put an unjust judge to death and stuﬀ his hide into a cushion. Swift wonders
                &lsquo;what Number of such <em>Cushions</em>&rsquo; the king had (<em>PW</em> 92). The satire in
                <em>GT</em> suggests that the corrupt and dexterous Flimnap (innuendo Walpole) has his neck saved at the
                court of an arbitrary oriental despot, the Emperor of Lilliput (innuendo King George).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>three</em><em> fi</em><em>ne silken Threads</em>: the colours correspond with the British Order of the
            Garter (blue), given to Walpole, May 1726; the Order of the Bath (red), revived by George I, May 1725; and
            the Order of the Thistle (green), revived by Queen Anne, 1703. The colours in the first edition of 1726 were
            purple, yellow, and white. Nevertheless, it was recognized that the &lsquo;Intent could be no other than to
            ridicule our <em>three</em> most noble Orders of the <em>Garter</em>, the <em>Thistle</em> and the
            <em>Bath</em>&rsquo; (<em>Key</em>, Part I, p. 16; see also Mrs Howard to Swift, <em>c.</em>10 November
            1726, <em>Corr.</em>, iii. 50). In the 1735 edition Swift is more specific. The 1735 text either restores
            the original colours that Motte may have altered in 1726 believing the satire to be too dangerous, or
            revises the colours to blue, red, and green since the satiric allusion had been recognized in 1726 without
            provoking a government prosecution. The seditious point of Swift&rsquo;s satire was noted, for example, in
            Curll&rsquo;s <em>Key</em> where it is loyally answered: &lsquo;But indeed the Meannesses to which the
            <em>Lilliputians</em> are subjected by an Arbitrary Prince can never be the fate of <em>Britons</em> thanks
            to the Happiness of our admirable Constitution!&rsquo; (<em>Key</em>, Part I, p. 16).</p>

                have been to the Earl of Nottingham, a former first Lord of the Admiralty, who was called
                &lsquo;Dismal&rsquo; because of his &lsquo;dark and dismal Countenance&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> 139;
                &lsquo;Toland&rsquo;s Invitation to Dismal, to Dine with the Calves-Head Club&rsquo;, <em>Poems</em>, i.
                161&ndash;6). Skyresh Bolgolam has &lsquo;a morose and sour Complection&rsquo;. Although a High
                Churchman, Nottingham was a Hanoverian Tory. He did not support the Tory Peace policy, siding with the
                Whigs on the peace and succession issues in the last years of Anne&rsquo;s reign. Swift savaged him as
                an apostate, a selfish unprovoked wrecker of the Tory government, and in eﬀect a true Whig (see e.g.
                &lsquo;An Excellent New Song, Being the Intended Speech of a Famous Orator against Peace&rsquo;,

                Caesars</em>, Book VIII). King George was praised in the Old Whig journal <em>Cato&rsquo;s Letters</em>

        <p><em>Animosities</em>: Swift described the party-political strife in London in 1703 (roughly contemporaneous
            with Gulliver&rsquo;s stay in Lilliput; Gulliver returns from Lilliput in 1702) as follows: &lsquo;I wish
            you had been here for ten days during the highest and warmest reign of party and faction that I ever knew or
            read of . . . It was so universal, that I observed the dogs in the streets much more contumelious and
            quarrelsome than usual . . . a committee of Whig and Tory cats had a very warm and loud debate upon the roof
            of our house. But why should we wonder at that, when the very ladies are split asunder into High Church and
            Low, and, out of zeal for religion, have hardly time to say their prayers?&rsquo; (Swift to the Revd William
            Tisdall, 16 December 1703, <em>Corr.</em>, i. 147).</p>

                1689 (36 years before 1725 when Swift was prepar-ing GT) until 1697 (the War of the League of Augsburg),
                and again in 1701&ndash;13 (War of the Spanish Succession).</li>

        <p><em>one Emperor lost his Life, and another his Crown</em>: Charles I was executed in 1649 and James II was
            deposed in 1689. An application for the entire passage would be the conflict between Catholics (Big Endians)
            and Protestants (Little Endians) since the Henrician Reformation, and between Roman Catholics, Anglicans,

            1688&ndash;9.<em> rendred incapable by Law</em>: an analogy would be with the Test Acts passed after the
            Restoration which required public oﬃce-holders to demon-strate their conformity to the established Church of
            England by taking the sacrament according to Anglican rites.</p>

        <p><em>Mark of Disa</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>ection</em>: a satiric reflection on the Walpolean Whig
            govern-ment&rsquo;s readiness to suspect the Tories of Jacobitism. Disaﬀection meant disloyalty to the
            ruling dynasty and establishment. Swift&rsquo;s satire invites us to believe that such charges are baseless
            and politically motivated, and that the accused, like Gulliver, are essentially innocent. Swift wrote to
            Pope in 1723: &lsquo;I have often made the same remark with you of my Infelicity in being so strongly
            attached to Traytors (as they call them) and Exiles, and State Criminalls&rsquo; (<em>Corr.</em>, ii. 468).
            In 1735 he tells Pope: &lsquo;I heartily wish you were what they call disaﬀected, as I, who detest
            abom-inate &amp; abhor every Creature who hath a dram of Power in either Kingdom&rsquo; (Williams, iv. 383).
            In 1737 Lord Bathurst described Swift as &lsquo;a disaﬀected person&rsquo; who would be reputed so for as
            long as Swift lived (Williams, v. 79).</p>

            Education of Ladyes&rsquo; Swift wrote: &lsquo;No French Romances, and few plays for young Ladyes&rsquo;
            (<em>PW</em> xii. 308). In <em>A Letter to a Young Lady, on her Marriage</em> (written in 1723, published
            1727) Swift recommends &lsquo;a Match of Prudence, and common Good-liking, without any Mixture of that

                thousand, four hundred and eighteen persons, not counting the women and small children. A number of
                them, however, were quick enough on their feet to escape this piss-flood; and when they reached the top
                of the hill above the University, sweating, coughing, spitting, and out of breath, they began to swear

        <p><em>Manner of Writing</em>: analogues for Gulliver&rsquo;s observations on Lilliputian writing style have
            been found in several works, fictitious and genuine. William Symson wrote of the East Indians in <em>A New
                Voyage to the East-Indies</em>: &lsquo;Their Way of Writing, is not like the <em>Europeans</em>, in a
            Line from the Left to the Right; nor like the <em>Hebrews</em>, from the Right to the Left; nor yet like the
            <em>Chinese</em>, from the Top of the Paper strait down to the Bottom; but from the Left Corner down to the
            Right, slanting down-wards&rsquo; (pp. 35&ndash;6). This passage was stolen and adapted from a real voyage
            book, John Ovington&rsquo;s <em>Voyage to Suratt</em> (1696) (R. W. Frantz, &lsquo;Gulliver&rsquo;s
            &ldquo;Cousin Sympson&rdquo;&rsquo; , <em>HLQ</em> 1 (1938), 331&ndash;3). Other analogues include a passage
            on Chinese writing in Swift&rsquo;s first patron, Sir William Temple&rsquo;s essay &lsquo;Of Heroic
            Virtue&rsquo; (1690; Temple, ii. 201). Swift has invented the &lsquo;Cascagians&rsquo;, and given this
            passage of Lilliputian exotica a satiric inflection with the reference to the handwriting of English ladies.
            A joke reanimated in the correspondence between Mrs Howard and Swift, Mrs Howard writing aslant to Swift
            &lsquo;downwards to the right on one Page, and upwards in the two others&rsquo; (<em>Corr.</em>, iii. 51,
            54).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>They bury their Dead . . . downwards</em>: Swift draws on actual voyage accounts for this Lilliputian
            custom. In Part II Gulliver will join a voyage bound for Surat. In Jean de Thevenot&rsquo;s <em>Voyages</em>
            (Paris, 1684) there is an</p>

            n s 33 (March 1986), 50&ndash;1). There are accounts of upright burials in voyage books Swift owned, see
            Linschoten, 263, and Thomas Herbert, <em>A Relation of Some Yeares Travaile, Begunne Anno</em><em>

            <em>Satiric Allegory: Mirror of Man</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1956), 74. PT observes that
            &lsquo;Swift&rsquo;s parody of literal-minded piety is in the tradition of satirical Utopian fiction&rsquo;.
            It also recalls the satire of Jack&rsquo;s literal-minded religious enthusiasm in Swift&rsquo;s <em>A Tale

            Swift&rsquo;s satire rejects cultural relativism insisting on universal truths about human nature and
            societies. Swift shares the view of his first patron, Sir William Temple, who after a consideration of
            Peruvian religion and government wrote in his essay &lsquo;Of Heroic Virtue&rsquo; (1690): &lsquo;it must, I
            think, be allowed, that human Nature is the same in these Remote, as well as the other more known and
            celebrated Parts of the World&rsquo; (Temple, ii. 210; see also Temple, i. 95).</p>

            16: 21). In a letter of October 1722 Swift refers to the Whig prosecutors of Tories accused of Jacobite

                for Jacobite plot-ting. With insuﬃcient evidence to secure a legal conviction Walpole&rsquo;s Whig
                government prosecuted him by parliamentary means in the House of Lords bringing in a bill of pains and

                surrendered after the 1715 Rebellion (many of whom were executed or transported) and to the Whig
                government&rsquo;s proclamation of George&rsquo;s clemency. The division in the Lilliputian court
                between the ministers calling for immediate capital punishment and the Emperor and Secretary Reldresal
                who think &lsquo;there was room for Mercy&rsquo; alludes to a division in the Whig court in 1723.
                Whether or not Atterbury should receive the death penalty &lsquo;divided the Court much and made the

        <p>mercy, and forgiving temper, have been so signal, so extraordinary, so more than humane during the whole

            most ingenious pamphlet just come over, relating to the wicked Bishop of Rochester&rsquo; (<em>Corr.</em>,
            ii. 432). The euphemistic clemency of the Emperor of Lilliput (innuendo George I) is probably also meant to
            recall the cruelty of the Roman Emperor Domitian described by Suetonius in his <em>The Lives of the
                Caesars</em>: &lsquo;[Domitian] never pronounced an unusually dreadful sen-tence without a preliminary
            declaration of clemency, so that there came to be no more certain indication of a cruel death than the
            leniency of his preamble&rsquo; (Suetonius, <em>Domitian</em>, xi. 2; R. F. Kennedy in <em>N&amp;Q</em>, 214
            (1969), 340&ndash;1). Jacobite polemicists cast George I as an oriental despot, as for example, in <em>The
                Character of Sultan Galga, the present Cham of Tartary</em> (<em>c.</em>1720), 2: &lsquo;the
            distinguishing Part of <em>GALGA</em>&rsquo;s Character, is, his cruel Disposition . . . Yet he talks every

                (<em>Measure for Measure</em>, i i. ii. 108&ndash;10) and in Milton&rsquo;s use of the giant analogy for
                the rebel angels in <em>Paradise Lost</em> (i. 197&ndash;200), and illustrated by the behaviour of the
                Giants and of Cyclops in Greek myth-ology. Swift&rsquo;s conventional usage of giants as bad can be seen
                in an attack on the Earl of Wharton in the <em>Examiner</em> (<em>PW</em> 9). As PT observes, Swift
                produces a surprise eﬀect in <em>GT</em> by making the Brobdingnagians the most humane and &lsquo;the
                least corrupted&rsquo; of the nations Gulliver visits. Gulliver was a humane giant in Lilliput.</li>

                <em>World</em>: &lsquo;I have not so much of the Vanity of a Traveller, as to be fond of telling

            Persons; and I being in want of Money, was prevailed upon to sell first, part of my share in him, and by
            degrees all of it. After this I heard he was carried about to be shown as a Sight, and that he died of the
            Small-pox at Oxford&rsquo; (see <em>Voyages</em>, i. 494&ndash;500, 502, 528). A literary analogue is in

                king and his views had seditious political resonance. The Stuart Pretender or &lsquo;James III&rsquo; is
                &lsquo;a huge Giant&rsquo; across the sea in a political allegory printed in Dublin in 1714 (<em>The
                    Life of</em> <em>Aristides, the Athenian; Who was Decreed to be Banish&rsquo;d for His Justice . .
                    .</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(Dublin: Printed by Daniel Tompson, 1714), 25). The King of Brobdingnag&rsquo;s views on England&rsquo;s
            taxes, national debt, wars, foreign deployment of the fleet, and mercenary standing army were understood by
            contemporary readers as &lsquo;a common <em>Jacobite</em> Insinuation&rsquo; (<em>Gulliver
                Decypher&rsquo;d</em> (London, n.d.), 38). The hereditary King of Brobdingnag&rsquo;s political
            philosophy and polity may be indebted to one of the most widely read contemporary French works in the genre
            of the imaginary voyage, Francois de Fen&eacute;lon&rsquo;s <em>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</em> (1699; see
            <em>Telemachus, son of Ulysses</em>, ed. and trans. Patrick Riley (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,
            1994) ). F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s work theorized a combination of monarchisn with the virtues of ancient
            Lycurgan Sparta, attacked luxury and militarism, and valued simplicity and the virtues of agriculture.
            F&eacute;nelon was profoundly admired by the Stuart Pretender or &lsquo;King James III&rsquo;. The Jacobite
            Charles Wogan refers to Swift as &lsquo;Mentor&rsquo;, Telemachus&rsquo; sage companion (actually Minerva in
            disguise), in a letter to Swift in 1733 (<em>Corr.</em>, iii. 590&ndash;3). For Whigs the Pretender was a
            &lsquo;fictitious Monarch&rsquo; (Thomas Burnett, <em>The British Bulwark</em> (London, 1715), 42). In
            having a fictional king articulate what could be understood as a Jacobite political critique of the
            Hanoverian Whig regime, Swift gives his satire the atmosphere of a dynastic challenge. There are parallels
            between the whiggish Gulliver&rsquo;s conversation with His Majesty of Brobdingnag and the (former Whig now
            Jacobite convert) Duke of Wharton&rsquo;s account of his interview with the Pretender in a sensational
            political work of 1726, <em>The Duke of Wharton&rsquo;s Reasons for Leaving his native Country, and
                espousing the Causes of his Royal Majesty King James III. in a Letter to his Friends in Great Britain
                and Ireland</em>. Swift denied the charge of Jacobitism that was often levelled at him by his Whig
            enemies. However, he thought that the threat of a revolt to a pretender might oblige ruling princes to
            govern well, although he lamented that it had &lsquo;not succeeded in mending Kings&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> v.
            292).</p>

        <p>(<em>PW</em> ii. 24). In <em>A Short Character of His Excellency Thomas Earl of Wharton</em>, Swift reports
            how the Whig Lord Lieutenant of Ireland refused the promotion of a chaplain, an esteemed gentleman of
            &lsquo;good Birth&rsquo;, decency, &lsquo;Wit&rsquo;, &lsquo;Learning&rsquo; and experience, because
            &lsquo;he had the original Sin of being a reputed Tory&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> iii. 183). In his partisan Tory
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>History of the Four Last Years of the Queen</em> Swift refers to Whig and Tory as &lsquo;those Fantastick
            Words&rsquo; which should have been dropped in favour of other names &lsquo;to distinguish Lovers of Peace
            [Tories] from Lovers of War [Whigs]&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> vii. 3). Whig and Tory was the primary
            party-political division in Swift&rsquo;s lifetime. Tory originally derived from the name of Irish Catholic
            bandits or rapparees. The Tories supported King Charles II and the hereditary succession in the Exclusion
            Crisis (1679&ndash;81). Swift called them the &lsquo;Church Party&rsquo; and the defence of the exclusive
            position of the Church of England was fundamental to their political ideology. The Tory party after the
            Revolution of 1688&ndash;9 had a Jacobite wing. In Ireland the appellation &lsquo;Tory&rsquo; denoted a
            supporter of the Jacobite succes-sion, so Swift rarely uses the term for his side of politics since it
            signified</p>

        <p>treason. After Queen Anne&rsquo;s Tory ministry of 1710&ndash;14, which Swift served as propagandist, the
            Tories never again formed a government in Swift&rsquo;s lifetime, being proscribed under George I and George
            II. The name Whig originally derived from whiggamore, a name for Scottish Puritan rebels in the Civil War.
            The Whigs supported the exclusion of the Catholic Duke of York from the throne in the Exclusion crisis. They
            supported the Revolution of 1688&ndash;9 and were the political party per-ceived as most sympathetic to
            Protestant Dissenters from the Established Church of England supporting Protestant religious freedom and
            toler-ation. They had an anticlerical, crypto-republican wing. The Whig party was entrenched in government
            after 1714.</p>

            The Houyhnhnms are without luxury and Brobdingnag is said to be &lsquo;the least corrupted&rsquo; of the

                Swift is nevertheless appar-ently familiar and young women are advised not to be. Amusingly, Swift

            Lords had any jurisdiction over appeals from the courts and Swift opposed it telling Charles Ford in a
            letter of 4 April 1720: &lsquo;I believe my self not guilty of too much veneration for the Irish H[ouse] of
            L[ords], but . . . the Question is whether People ought to be Slaves or no&rsquo; (<em>Corr.</em>, ii. 327).

            <li><em>never once known to degenerate</em>: the degeneracy of the aristocracy was a traditional satiric
                topos and Juvenal, <em>Satires</em>, viii, was an important model. The degeneration of the hereditary
                nobility was a virulent theme in Jacobite writing against the Williamite and Hanoverian regimes. Swift
                traced the degeneration of the nobility to the &lsquo;Rebellion and Usurpation&rsquo; of the 1640s and
                1650s (<em>PW</em> 47) and to the Revolution of 1688&ndash;9 and the Williamite Whig creations
                (<em>PW</em> vii. 19, 21). In Ireland, Swift wrote, the Lords were &lsquo;a mungril Breed&rsquo; and
                &lsquo;Peerage is a wither&rsquo;d Flower&rsquo; (<em>Poems</em>, ii. 570).</li>

        <p><em>These were searched . . . People</em>: although Swift was strident in defence of episcopacy he rarely has
            a good word for contemporary bishops. Cf. his observation on the Revd Thomas Sawbridge, Dean of Ferns, in a
            letter to the Earl of Oxford in 1730: &lsquo;There is a fellow here from England one Sawbridge, he was last
            term indited for a Rape. The Plea he intended was his being drunk when he forced the woman; but he bought
            her oﬀ; He is a Dean and I name him to your Lordship, because I am confident you will hear of his being a
            Bishop&rsquo; (<em>Corr.</em>, iii. 322; <em>Poems</em>, ii. 516&ndash;20). A contemporary story has it that
            when &lsquo;King George . . . made several odd and illiterate English Clergymen Bishops in Ireland&rsquo;
            his choice was freely condemned when they came over to Ireland. &lsquo;Upon which Swift said with a grave
            face, ye are in the wrong to blame his Majesty before you know the truth: He sent us over very good and
            great Men, but they were murder&rsquo;d by a parcell of highway Men between Chester and London, who slipping
            on their gowns and Cassocks here pretend to pass for those Bishops&rsquo; (Ehrenpreis, ii. 771; iii. 168).
            The failure of the Dean of St Patrick&rsquo;s to become a bishop clearly rankled; he wrote in <em>Verses
                on</em> <em>the Death of Dr. Swift</em> that &lsquo;h a d he but spar&rsquo;d his Tongue and Pen, | He

                account of his country is a combination of traditional satiric themes and contemporary opposition
                politics. The attack on a degener-ate nobility, unfree elections, a corrupt legal system, criminal
                mis-management of the treasury, and a mercenary standing army were prom-inent themes in Jacobite
                propaganda against the Hanoverian Whig state. Cf. the Duke of Wharton&rsquo;s critique of Hanoverian
                England and account of his interview with the Stuart Pretender, &lsquo;James III&rsquo;, published in
                1726: &lsquo;the Triennial Act repelled, standing Armies and martial Law established by Authority of
                Parliament, the Convocation of the Clergy prevented from meeting, the orthodox Members of the Church
                discouraged, Schism, Ignorance and Atheism become the only Recommendations to Ecclesiastical Benefices;
                both Houses filled with the corrupt Tools of the Court, the Nation overwhelmed with exorbitant Taxes,

                fond of a Title and Precedence. Thus will that whole Bench, in an Age or two, be composed of mean,

            continuing the War cry up our constant Success at a most prodigious rate . . . Getting into the
            Enemy&rsquo;s Lines, passing Rivers, and taking Towns, may be Actions attended with many glorious

            Money might be better employed . . .&rsquo;. The &lsquo;true Spring or Motive&rsquo; of the war against
            France &lsquo;was the aggrandizing a particular Family, and in short, a War of the <em>General</em> and the
            <em>Ministry</em>, and not of the <em>Prince</em> or <em>People</em>&rsquo; (<em>PW</em>, vi. 19&ndash;20,

        <p><em>mercenary standing Army</em>: the King of Brobdingnag&rsquo;s observations recall the argument against
            standing armies in <em>Utopia</em> comparing mercenary soldiers to thieves (<em>Utopia</em>, 17).
            Swift&rsquo;s first patron Sir William Temple argued against a standing army in <em>An Essay upon the
                Original and Nature</em> <em>of Government</em> (Temple, i. 102) and used the same family metaphor of
            father-children-servant as Swift does in his anti-army writings (see Robert C. Steensma, &lsquo;Swift on
            Standing Armies: A Possible Source&rsquo;,<em> N&amp;Q</em>, n s 10 (1963), 215&ndash;16). Opposition to
            standing armies was a popu-lar theme of Old Whigs and Tories during William III&rsquo;s reign. After the
            Hanoverian accession, total opposition to standing armies was a Jacobite theme. Charles Leslie set the tone
            in 1715: &lsquo;For when he [the &lsquo;Elector of Brunswick&rsquo; i.e. George I] has an army, he may
            augment it to a number that shall make you hewers of wood and drawers of water; which deserves the notice of
            whig as well as tory, for the calamity will be general, and therefore equally aﬀect both&rsquo; (<em>The
                Church of England&rsquo;s Advice to her</em> <em>Children, and to all Kings, Princes, and
                Potentates</em>, in <em>Somers Tracts</em>, xiii. 699). The Jacobite George Flint was
            &lsquo;amaz&rsquo;d, astonish&rsquo;d&rsquo; how any man with a family and property could be &lsquo;pleased
            to see a standing Army&rsquo; (<em>The Shift Shifted</em>, no. 7 (16 June 1716), 41). As propagandist for
            Queen Anne&rsquo;s Tory government in the <em>Examiner</em> of 21 December 1710 Swift considered &lsquo;a
            Kingdom as a great Family, whereof the Prince is the Father; and it will appear plainly, that Mercenary
            Troops are only<em> Servants armed</em>&rsquo; and associated standing armies with the military tyranny of
            Caesar in Rome and Cromwell in England (<em>PW</em> iii. 41, 44). In 1722 Swift denounced the mercenary
            standing army kept up by King George I and his Whig ministry (<em>PW</em> ix. 31&ndash;2). In a bleak
            description of Hanoverian Ireland (written <em>c.</em>1730), Swift computed that the impover-</p>

                Oxford manuscript of 1325 and guns are known to have been used in Florence in 1326. Gunpowder was said
                to have been invented by a German monk Bertholdus or Michael Schwarz in about 1320 (Gough, 376; PT). The
                gunpowder revolution in military technology had begun in Europe over three centuries earlier, however

        <p><em>as to Ideas . . . Heads</em>: the satiric strategy of expressing wisdom as sim-plicity, obtuseness, and
            ignorance is used with devastating misanthropic eﬀect in Part IV in the Houyhnhnm Master&rsquo;s reaction to
            what he hears about humankind. The satirized Laputians in Part III are absurdly and dangerously given to
            abstraction and theory. The King of Brobdingnag, the Houyhnhnms, and More&rsquo;s Utopians are like the
            Ancients and lack the scholastic philosophy and abstract conceptions which More, like Erasmus, mocked. Swift
            may ironically recall a satiric passage in <em>Utopia</em> which in turn was indebted to Erasmus:
            &lsquo;while they equal the ancients in almost all subjects, they are far from matching the inventions of
            our modern logicians. In fact they have not discovered even one of those elaborate rules about restrictions,

                but was particularly popular in the seventeenth century (Gough, 377; PT). A French dissertation (1718)
                argued that Adam was 123 feet 9 inches high, Eve, 118 feet and 9&frac34; inches, Moses 13 feet, and
                Alexander only 6 feet (Eddy, 123). It was almost a topos in voyage literature texts to report the
                presence of giants or how the histor-ies and excavations in remote countries indicated that there were
                giants in the past (for many examples, see D. F. Passmann, <em>&lsquo;Full of Improbable</em>

            found the heads lying by them, the teeth thereof being three fingers broad, and foure fingers long, and five
            quarters square, which were sent into divers places of <em>Peru</em>&rsquo; (Linschoten, 270). Gulliver

            shibboleth. The Country platform of Tories and Old Whigs in the 1690s called for the disbandment of the
            army. In 1697 Robert Harley, later to be leader of Queen Anne&rsquo;s Tory government of 1710&ndash;14 and a
            friend of Swift&rsquo;s, moved to disband all the standing forces raised since 1680. William III and George
            I preferred a professional standing army to a militia. Robert Walpole thought the army more reliable than
            the militia in controlling popular disturbances (see Cruickshanks, 83&ndash;4, 98). More&rsquo;s Utopia is
            basically pacifist, but men and women undertake military training and can form a citizen&rsquo;s army if the

            informed Swift in February 1723 that &lsquo;As for the reigning Amusement of the town, tis entirely Musick.

        <p><em>Mortals so singular</em>: cf. Ned Ward&rsquo;s satire in <em>The London Spy</em> on the unworldly,

            many lines and angles in his face as you shall find in Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em>, and he looked as if
            he had fed upon nothing but Cursus Mathematicus for a fortnight&rsquo; (Ward, 52). PT observes that the
            satiric device of putting unworldly intellectuals literally up in the air can be traced back to Aristophanes
            (<em>Clouds</em>, 218 ﬀ.), where Socrates is suspended in a basket. The appearance of the Laputians has been
            compared to an emblematic picture of &lsquo;Mathematica&rsquo; in the <em>Icones</em></p>

            satire on Sir Isaac Newton with reference to contemporary anecdotes about his absent-mindedness and
            impracticality (Gough, 382). Newton was loathed by Swift and the Tories for his activ-ities as Warden of
            Mint (it was said that Newton would be the first Whig hanged at a Stuart restoration), for approving the
            quality of William Wood&rsquo;s copper coinage, and as the symbol of Hanoverian patronage of mathematics:

            anticlerical Whig by the name of John Partridge. Calling himself Isaac Bickerstaﬀ, a rival astrologer, Swift
            in a sequence of premeditated pamphlets predicted Partridge would die on the night of 29 March, gave a
            circumstantial account of his death, and, when Partridge claimed to be alive, published a vindication of
            Bickerstaﬀ&rsquo;s veracity on the fact of Partridge&rsquo;s death. This April Fool&rsquo;s Day hoax

            relation to the sun would be disas-trous and lead to the earth falling into the sun. Newton was optimistic

            concluded that the biblical Flood had been caused by a comet. Edmond Halley read a paper about Noah&rsquo;s

            which appeared in the year 1680 was in its perihelion less distant from the sun . . . being attracted
            something nearer to the sun in every revolution, will at last fall down upon the body of the sun&rsquo;

            reinforced by the second law of thermo-dynamics, would later fuel theories of degeneration in the nineteenth

                earth&rsquo;s magnetism) which was capable of turning in a vertical plane about a horizontal axis. The
                heterodox Whig William Whiston&rsquo;s account in <em>A New Theory of the</em> <em>Earth</em> of the
                &lsquo;Power of Attraction belonging to the Loadstone&rsquo; (i. 2) and calculation of the oblique
                motion of the heavenly bodies (&lsquo;If a Body, as B, be moving uniformly along the line DC, from D to

                . .&rsquo; see i. 8 and <em>passim</em>) is probably one of the sources parodied by Swift in
                Gulliver&rsquo;s technical account and explanatory figure of the loadstone and the motion of the flying
                island. The Royal Society&rsquo;s<em> Philosophical Transactions</em> contain many papers of specialist

                Dominions</em>&rsquo; (<em>Key</em>, Part III, p. 15). The Flying Island is associated with England and
            the Hanoverian Court, and later in Part III there is allusion to that Court&rsquo;s arbitrary power and
            oppression of Ireland. For Swift a sign of that oppression was the Woollen Act (1699) of the English
            parliament which banned the export of woollen goods from Ireland to any destination other than England,
            where there were already prohibitive import duties. As PT suggests there is also a biblical allusion to Job
            7: 6: &lsquo;My days are swifter than a weaver&rsquo;s shuttle, and are spent without hope&rsquo;. An
            unprinted passage later in Part III valorizing armed insurrection, revolution, and regicide will suggest how
            the Irish may hope to end arbitrary Whig oppression.</p>

            cutting oﬀ their light supply with a wall of thick cloud, a total eclipse which eﬀectively condemned the
            Moon to permanent darkness (Lucian, 258). The passage is usually understood to be referring to
            England&rsquo;s economic oppression of Ireland. In the <em>Drapier&rsquo;s</em> <em>Letters</em> Swift wrote
            that English trade restrictions imposed on Ireland &lsquo;denied the <em>Bene</em><em>fi</em><em>ts</em>

                unpublished in Swift&rsquo;s lifetime. In September 1722 the Whig authorities received sworn
                infor-mation of an Irish Jacobite plot to kill King George (see Ian Higgins, &lsquo;Jonathan Swift and
                the Jacobite Diaspora&rsquo;, <em>Reading Swift</em>, 98). In the published <em>Drapier&rsquo;s
                    Letters</em> Swift denied that Irish resistance to Wood&rsquo;s patent represented a rebellious

                of the provision in the Act of Settlement (1701) forbidding the King to leave England without
                parliament&rsquo;s approval. There is also an oblique innuendo about princesses in the House of Hanover

                patron Sir William Temple (a friend and adviser of William III). Such particular identifications, all in
                some ways unsatisfactory, are assessed by F. P. Lock who concludes that he is principally &lsquo;a

            water in capillary tubes and the eﬀect on the flow of water at various heights, and accounts of experiments
            concerning running water in pipes (Nicolson, 150&ndash;1). The story may allude to the South Sea Bubble
            catastrophe of 1720 and to contemporary entrepreneurial projects involving water and mills, for which see
            Pat Rogers, &lsquo;Gulliver and the Engineers&rsquo;, <em>MLR</em> 70 (1975), 260&ndash;70. The story is
            also possibly a political allusion to the Act of Settlement of 1701 which had diverted the hereditary
            succession of the crown from the House of Stuart to the remote (but Protestant) House of Hanover. Munodi had
            complied with this Laputian act in 1701 (innu-endo: the Tories had complied with the Act of Settlement), but
            the destruction of his &lsquo;mill&rsquo; (innuendo: the English Stuart line: in con-temporary political
            iconography, as, for example, in the Dutch print &lsquo;Qualis vir Talis Oratio&rsquo; dated 16 October

            deviation to a new one (innuendo: the distant House of Hanover) was ruinous for Munodi (innuendo: the Tory
            party). The Jacobite Matthias Earbery used the trope of water current and water-mills for dynastic political
            commen-tary in his edition of <em>Advices from Parnassus. By Trajano Boccalini</em>, no. III (May 1727),

                (1709) and had proposed an Academy for the English language in <em>A Proposal for Correcting, Improving

                Philosophical Society. Swift&rsquo;s satire of the new science describes or is based on actual
                contemporary experi-ments reported in the publications of the English Royal Society (see Marjorie
                Nicolson and Nora M. Mohler, &lsquo;The Scientific Background of Swift&rsquo;s Voyage to Laputa&rsquo;,

        <p>which had a reputation for religious toleration and the Newtonian mod-ern science. One of Swift&rsquo;s
            earlier satiric victims the anticlerical Whig Astrologer John Partridge (see Swift&rsquo;s Bickerstaﬀ
            Papers, <em>PW</em> ii. 139&ndash;64) claimed to have studied at the University of Leiden. The Latin name of
            the University of Leiden, Academia Lugduno-Batavo, was commonly abbreviated in booklists and correspondence
            as &lsquo;Acad. Lugd.&rsquo; (from which Swift possibly derived &lsquo;Academy of Lagado&rsquo;) and the
            physical description of the Academy has been thought to resemble the University of Leiden more than Gresham
            College, the home of the Royal Society (see Dolores J. Palomo, &lsquo;The Dutch Connection: The University
            of Leiden and Swift&rsquo;s Academy of Lagado&rsquo;, <em>HLQ</em> 41 (1977), 27&ndash;35). The Dublin
            Philosophical Society had external ties with the Royal Society and articles from the Dublin Society were
            published in the Royal Society&rsquo;s <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>. It focused on scientific papers
            and encouraged experimentation. William Petty, whose statistical approach to population studies is parodied
            in the conversation between Gulliver and the King of Brobdingnag in Part II, was first president of the
            Dublin Philosophical Society. In satirizing what he regarded as misguided scien-tific experimentation, Swift
            characteristically has multiple targets, but there is an underlying ideological consistency, and that is to
            discredit the Newtonian Whig intelligentsia which received the patronage of the Hanoverian court and to
            ridicule anything even remotely connected with the Dutch.</p>

        <p><em>most ingenious Architect . . . Bee . . . Spider</em>: probably a satiric gibe at Sir John Vanbrugh, the
            anticlerical Whig dramatist and architect whose architectural achievement Swift regarded as ridiculous. The
            discourse on architecture in the four parts of <em>GT</em> can be and was construed as per-sonal satire on
            this high-profile member of the Whig elite. The bee and spider were insects admired for their architectural
            skills, see Virgil,<em> Georgics</em>, iv. 178&ndash;9; Pliny, <em>Natural History</em>, xi. 5&ndash;6, 28.
            Cf. the fable of the Bee and Spider in <em>The Battle of the Books</em> (<em>PW</em> i. 147&ndash;51). Swift
            alludes to contemporary architectural experiments in which floors and bridges were proposed or designed
            without supports under them (Nicolson, 139).</p>

        <p><em>a Man born blind</em>: probably meant to reflect on Newton&rsquo;s corpuscular theory of light reported
            in the <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>, but is specific-ally based on Robert Boyle&rsquo;s account of a
            blind man at Maastricht who could tell colours by touch. Boyle believed he really did it by smelling
            (diﬀerent coloured dyes had diﬀerent scents). Martinus Scriblerus was the first to find out &lsquo;the
            <em>Palpability</em> of <em>Colours</em>&rsquo; and could distinguish &lsquo;Rays of Light&rsquo; (Nicolson,

            Society reported a custom in Ceylon where buﬀaloes were enclosed in a patch of ground and would be left

                the Sun&rsquo;s apparent motion (Nicolson, 139&ndash;40). Newton however would have been no match for

            were used at his trial as evidence against him. The reference to a lame dog was Walpole&rsquo;s main break

            Jacobite correspondence, for &lsquo;T. Illington&rsquo; had been sent such a dog. For Swift&rsquo;s virulent

            &lsquo;because in Times of Tranquility, standing Armies might be thought a Grievance, a new kind of War was
            contrived, a Plague was denounced, Forces were decreed to be kept on Foot&rsquo; (Lansdowne, 5). Swift may
            also be recalling More&rsquo;s hostility to standing armies in <em>Utopia</em>: &lsquo;. . . an even more
            pestiferous plague. Even in peacetime, if you can call it peace, the whole country is crowded and overrun

        <p><em>not poisoned, but . . . Drinking</em>: Alexander, King of Macedonia, conquered Greece and Egypt and
            defeated the King of Persia at the Battle of Arbela in modern Iraq in 331 b c. The story that he was
            poisoned is mentioned in Plutarch&rsquo;s <em>Life of Alexander</em> where he is said to have actually died
            of a fever after excessive drinking, although Plutarch quotes Aristobulus that the fever caused the
            excessive drinking (PT). On 29 February 1712 Swift was reading the Greek historian and philosopher Flavius
            Arrianus&rsquo; <em>De</em> <em>Expeditione Alexandri</em>. He tells Esther Johnson in a journal letter to
            her: &lsquo;I came home early, and have read 200 Pages of Arrian, Alexdr the great is just dead; I do not
            think he was poisoned. Betwixt you and me all those are but idle Storyes, tis certain that neither Ptolomy
            nor Aristobulus thought so, and they were both with him when [he] died. Tis a Pity we have not their

        <p><em>Brutus</em>: Marcus Junius Brutus, tyrannicide, a close friend of Julius Caesar who nevertheless was one
            of the conspirators who assassinated him in 44 b c. For Swift, as for many of his contemporaries in the
            early eighteenth century, Brutus is viewed as a champion of liberty. Swift invoked Cato and Brutus in a
            pamphlet of 1712 attacking the Duke of Marlborough and the former Whig ministry: &lsquo;<em>Cato</em> and
            <em>Brutus</em> were the two most virtuous Men in <em>Rome</em> . . . those two excellent Men, who thought
            it base to stand Neuter where the Liberties of their Country was at stake, joined heartily on that side
            which undertook to preserve the Laws and Constitu-tion, against the Usurpations of a victorious General,
            whose Ambition was bent to overthrow them&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> vi. 134). In Swift&rsquo;s <em>Drapier&rsquo;s
                Letters</em> attacking the English Whig government over Wood&rsquo;s Patent to mint copper coins for
            Ireland, the Drapier is given the initials &lsquo;M.B.&rsquo; and King George is Caesar (<em>PW</em> x. 21;
            see Jack G. Gilbert, &lsquo;The Drapier&rsquo;s Initials&rsquo;,<em> N&amp;Q</em>, n s 10 (1963),
            217&ndash;18). Swift&rsquo;s praise of Brutus in <em>GT</em> seems capable of diﬀerent political
            interpretations. One interpretation is that it expresses Swift&rsquo;s loyal Old Whig principles:
            &lsquo;Ever since 1688, an analogy had been drawn between the defence of the Republic by heroes like Cato
            and Brutus and the achievement of the English in the Glorious Revolu-tion, who had won their fight against
            Stuart absolutism . . . many polit-ical writers of the age had come to view the Revolution principles in
            terms of Roman republican values. These were the &ldquo;Old Whig&rdquo; prin-ciples&rsquo; and Swift&rsquo;s
            choice of heroes reflects these principles (Passmann, 341). An alternative reading is that the meaning is
            seditious since Brutus was praised in militant contemporary Jacobite propaganda aimed at over-throwing the
            Hanoverian monarchy (cf. Richard Savage, &lsquo;Britannia&rsquo;s Miseries&rsquo; (ll. 99&ndash;104), in
            <em>The Poetical Works of Richard Savage</em>, ed. Clarence Tracy (Cambridge, 1962), 23: &lsquo;Who
            cou&rsquo;d behold such Noble Virtues fall, | And not (like Brutus) own the Generous Call? | He
            scorn&rsquo;d (when Honour summon&rsquo;d[)] Friendship&rsquo;s bond, | And from oppression freed his Native
            Land. | His Friend he knew not, when a Tyrant grown, | But stab&rsquo;d that C&aelig;sar that Userp&rsquo;d
            the Throne&rsquo;; cf. <em>The</em> <em>True Briton</em>, no. 20 (9 August 1723) in <em>The Life and
                Writings of Philip Late Duke of Wharton</em>, 2 vols. (London, 1732), i. 173: &lsquo;t h e Great
            <em>Brutus </em>who stabb&rsquo;d <em>C&aelig;sar</em>, is a Noble Mark of Publick Spirit&rsquo;. For George
            Granville, Baron Lansdowne in his militantly Jacobitical <em>A Letter from a</em> <em>Noble-Man Abroad, to
                His Friend in England</em> (1722), &lsquo;<em>Brutus</em> was an hon-ourable Man&rsquo; (pp. 6&ndash;7).
            A Whig writer observed in 1721: &lsquo;does not he, who recommends the Assassinating <em>C&aelig;sar</em> as
            an Heroic Action, encour-age all those; who think they have as just a Cause to murder their King?&rsquo;
            (Matthew Tindal, <em>The Judgement of Dr. Prideaux</em> (London, 1721), 39).</p>

            was truly a model chosen by nature to show how far human virtue and con-stancy could go.&rsquo; Horace
            praised Caesar who subjugated the whole earth &lsquo;Excepting Cato&rsquo;s unrelenting soul&rsquo;
            (Montaigne, 171, 172). The last line of Swift&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ode to Dr William Sancroft&rsquo; praises the
            Archbishop of Canterbury, who refused to acknowledge William III as King after the Revolution of
            1688&ndash;9 by saying that &lsquo;Heaven and Cato both are pleas&rsquo;d&rsquo; (<em>Poems</em>, i. 42,

            <li><em>Amboyna</em>: Ambon in Indonesia. This spice-island in the East Indies was controlled by the Dutch
                but the English had trading rights there. It was infamous for Swift&rsquo;s contemporaries as the site
                of a Dutch atrocity in 1623 in which Englishmen were tortured and killed (see William J. Brown,
                &lsquo;Gulliver&rsquo;s Passage on the Dutch <em>Amboyna</em>&rsquo;, <em>ELN</em> 1 (1964),
                262&ndash;4). Swift&rsquo;s cousin John Dryden produced a play on the sensational subject,
                <em>Amboyna</em> (1673; Dryden, xii. 1&ndash;77, and p. 264 noting Swift&rsquo;s agreement with Dryden
                about the Dutch in Amboyna). The atrocity at &lsquo;Amboyna&rsquo; was invoked in Tory and Jacobite

                mythic Houyhnhnms are horses, not humans; however, the homonymous similarity between
                &lsquo;Houyhnhnm&rsquo; and &lsquo;human&rsquo; and the fact that Houyhnhnm society is modelled on
                Lycurgan Sparta as described in Xenophon&rsquo;s <em>Constitution of the Spartans</em> and
                Plutarch&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life of Lycurgus&rsquo;, on the utopias of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em> and

                <em>Essays</em>, i. 31 (&lsquo;Of Cannibals&rsquo;), and on accounts of Golden Age primitivism, enables
                readers to understand them as pre-Christian &lsquo;Ancients&rsquo; or utopians. The Houyhnhnms are
                mythic embodiments of what Temple in &lsquo;Of Heroic Virtue&rsquo; described as the foundation
                principle of China&rsquo;s &lsquo;Prince of Philosophers, the Great and Renowned
                <em>Confutius</em>&rsquo;, an ideal of human aspiration: &lsquo;That every Man ought to study and
                endeavour the improving and perfecting of his own Natural Reason to the great Height he is capable, so
                as he may never (or as seldom as can be) err and swerve from the Law of Nature&rsquo; (Temple, i. 200).

                shock to his first readers by overturning a commonplace definition of man as a rational animal and the
                horse as an instance of an irrational animal given prominence in the logic textbooks of the seventeenth
                and early eighteenth centuries. The proposition &lsquo;rational&rsquo; is to &lsquo;irrational&rsquo; as
                &lsquo;man&rsquo; is to &lsquo;horse&rsquo; found in the third-century neo-platonist

            would &lsquo;undertake to prove by force | Of Argument, a Man&rsquo;s no Horse&rsquo; (<em>Hudibras</em>, i.
            i. 65, 71&ndash;2, p. 3). As a student at Trinity College Dublin Swift would have come across the definition
            &lsquo;<em>animal rationale</em>&rsquo; in the <em>Institutio logicae</em> of Narcissus Marsh (Dublin, 1679;
            reissued Dublin, 1681) and the particular formulation of the logical definition in this work was recalled by
            Swift when he stated in 1725 that his misanthropic inten-tion in <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em> was to
            prove &lsquo;the falsity of that Definition animal rationale&rsquo; (Crane, 248&ndash;53; see
            <em>Corr.</em>, ii. 607, 623). Swift invents a fable where a hypothetical horse species are rational animals
            and humans generally worse than unreasoning brutes. PT observes that the idea of an intellectually superior
            horse goes back to Chiron, the centaur in Greek mythology, the educator of Jason and Achilles. Swift also
            draws on a tradition positing that animals provide humankind with exemplary patterns of conduct and are
            superior to civilized humans because they are more natural, a tradition of paradox drawn on by earlier
            misanthropic satirists such as John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester (see James E. Gill, &lsquo;Beast over Man:
            Theriophilic Paradox in Gulliver&rsquo;s &ldquo;Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms&rdquo;&rsquo; ,
            <em>SP</em> 67 (1970), 532&ndash;49). The traditional view is that the Houyhnhnms are meant to be admirable,
            but a modern interpretation developed in the twentieth century has claimed that they are objects of satiric
            criticism. For the critical debate see: James L. Cliﬀord, &lsquo;Gulliver&rsquo;s Fourth Voyage:
            &ldquo;Hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;Soft&rdquo; Schools of Interpretation&rsquo;, in Larry S. Champion (ed.),

            Macmillan, 1989). For a rebuttal of the usual charges against the Houyhnhnms and emphasis on Swift&rsquo;s
            aggressive purposes in presenting them as the satire&rsquo;s positive, see Rawson, 14&ndash;15, 18&ndash;19,

            satire works to conflate human with Yahoo. Travel books recorded an inland tribe in Guinea called
            &lsquo;<em>Yahoos</em>&rsquo; (John Robert Moore, &lsquo;The Yahoos of the African Travellers&rsquo;,
            <em>N&amp;Q</em> 195 (1950), 182&ndash;5; Moore comments that the African Yahoos lived &lsquo;under more
            complete subjection to their masters than the Helots ever did&rsquo; (185) ) and the &lsquo;Yaios&rsquo; of
            Guiana (Frank Kermode, &lsquo;Yahoos and Houyhnhnms&rsquo;, <em>N&amp;Q</em> 195 (1950), 317&ndash;18).
            Swift drew on several sources for the Yahoos: accounts of the people of &lsquo;savage nations&rsquo; in
            voyage literature and accounts of simians in voyage literature (see Frantz; Passmann, &lsquo;<em>Full of
                Improbable Lies</em>&rsquo;, esp. pp. 186&ndash;94); accounts of the &lsquo;savage Irish&rsquo; in
            Swift&rsquo;s and in English colonialist writings (see Firth,</p>

            hamstring cattle) in 1711 (the year Gulliver enters Houyhnhnmland); accounts of the helots of ancient
            Sparta, serfs with pariah status who were periodic-ally slaughtered (William H. Halewood, &lsquo;Plutarch in

            185&ndash;94). The Yahoos have also been seen to embody Christian symbols of Original Sin (Roland M. Frye,

            In a passage printed in the last chapter of the first edition of 1726, but not reproduced in
            Faulkner&rsquo;s edition of 1735, Gulliver speculates that the original &lsquo;two <em>Yahoos</em>&rsquo;
            from which the race has degenerated &lsquo;may have been <em>English</em>&rsquo; thus giving, Swift
            insultingly suggests, Gulliver&rsquo;s countrymen, who would claim a colonial title to Houyhnhnmland, a kind
            of native title as Yahoos.</p>

            potential hougher who might lead Yahoos in raids on Houyhnhnm cattle that Gulliver will be deported from
            Houyhnhnmland, exiled as if he were a traitor.</p>

            &lsquo;The Monkeys that are in these Parts are the ugliest I ever saw . . . If they meet with a single
            Person they will threaten to devour him. When I have been alone I have been afraid to shoot them, especially
            the first Time I met them. They were a great Company dancing from Tree to Tree, over my Head; chattering and
            making a terrible Noise; and a great many grim Faces, and shewing antick Gestures. Some broke down dry
            Sticks and threw at me; others scattered their Urine and Dung about my Ears&rsquo; (<em>Voyages</em>, ii.

            (1729) are said to be willing to devour the Irish nation without salt (<em>PW</em> xii. 117). However,
            Gulliver, who is discovering that horses are the rational animals and humankind worse than unreasoning
            brutality, now finds that this utopian society based on the highest ideals of civilized aspiration, a life
            lived in accord with reason and nature, is without salt, a supposed defining commodity of civilization. It
            was also one of the spoils of the English maritime empire. Dampier describes the &lsquo;great Trade for
            Salt&rsquo; and how at the island of Mayo the English &lsquo;have commonly a Man of War here for the Guard
            of our Ships and Barks that come to take it in; of which I have been inform&rsquo;d that in some Years there

        <p><em>almost the same Observation</em>: Emperor Charles V is supposed to have said that he would speak to his
            God in Spanish, his mistress in Italian, and his horse in German (Gough, 414; PT). &lsquo;<em>German</em>,
            <em>Spanish</em> and <em>Italian</em>&rsquo; are cited for their permanence in Swift&rsquo;s <em>A Proposal
                for Correcting, Improving</em> <em>and Ascertaining the English Tongue</em> (<em>PW</em> iv. 9).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>not the least Idea of Books or Literature</em>: ancient Sparta is said to have had no written
                literature but did have an oral tradition of poetry and song (&lsquo;Lycurgus&rsquo;, xxi). Socrates
                (with whose opinions the Houyhnhnms are elsewhere said to agree) preferred oral poetry over written
                literature (Plato, <em>Phaedrus</em>, 274d&ndash;278b). Robert C. Elliott, <em>The Shape of Utopia</em>
                (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970) observes that the abolition of books is a characteristic of
                utopian fiction (pp. 121&ndash;8). Swift could</li>

        <p><em>He knew it was impossible</em>: as explained below, ideal or unfallen Houyhnhnm reason is cognitive
            rather than ratiocinative, when the Houyhnhnms have to deduce from apparent evidence they often get it wrong
            or cannot do it. The Houyhnhnms like the Spartans of Lycurgus are in a closed society cut oﬀ from the world
            and therefore from the corruption that comes from the luxury of maritime empires. Their ignorance is a sign
            of their bliss and primitivist virtue.</p>

            Florentine&rsquo;s work, especially the seventh dialogue concerning horse versus man, was one of
            Swift&rsquo;s probable sources for Part IV (see Benjamin Boyce, <em>Tom Brown of Facetious Memory</em>
            (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1939), 84&ndash;5).</p>

            her body (<em>Paradise Lost</em>, v. 383&ndash;4, p. 304). Gulliver&rsquo;s sexual modesty is a sign of
            fallen human nature (Genesis 3: 7: &lsquo;And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
            were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons&rsquo;).</p>

            <li><em>All this . . . consented to</em>: the Houyhnhnms are not supposed to lie, and have great diﬃculty
                with the concept, but he has agreed to suppress the truth at Gulliver&rsquo;s request. The Houyhnhnm
                Assembly later deports Gulliver because he is a potentially corrupting influence in Houyhnhnmland and
                this episode would appear to be an (albeit comic) instance of fallen human influence.</li>

                6). The corruption of the language is dated from &lsquo;the great Rebellion in Forty-two&rsquo; and
                subsequent &lsquo;Usurpation&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> iv. 9&ndash;10) and further decline in the language
                follows from the Revolution and start of William III&rsquo;s reign: &lsquo;<em>the continual Corruption
                    of our</em> English <em>Tongue;</em> <em>which, without some timely Remedy, will
                    su</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>er more by the false Re</em><em>fi</em><em>nements of Twenty Years past, than
                    it hath been improved in the foregoing Hundred</em>&rsquo;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(<em>PW</em> ii. 174). Swift laments &lsquo;a Tendency to lapse into the Barbarity of those <em>Northern</em>
            Nations from whom we are descended&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> iv. 12, cf. <em>PW</em> ii. 175). He condemns
            &lsquo;those barbarous Mutilations of Vowels and Syllables&rsquo; in the English language (<em>PW</em> ii.
            176).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Revolution</em>: that of 1688&ndash;9.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>long War</em>: that of the League of Augsberg (1689&ndash;97), soon followed by the War of the Spanish
            Succession (1701&ndash;13).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Ambition . . . to govern</em>: compare the scathing denunciation of French foreign policy, war-mongering,
            and the territorial ambitions of kings in <em>Utopia</em>, 28&ndash;31. Cf. also Rabelais (i. 33, pp.
            109&ndash;13) satirizing King Picrochole and his advisers and their ambition of world conquest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Di</em><em>ﬀ</em><em>erence in Opinions</em>: Swift&rsquo;s satire on religious controversy, war,
                and the profession of soldier might be compared with the violent satiric denunci-ation of religious
                madness, war, and its causes compiled in Burton, &lsquo;Democritus Junior to the Reader&rsquo;, i.
                39&ndash;49. The sequence of subjects in Swift&rsquo;s satire in Part IV, chapters v and vi &ndash; war,
                law, money &ndash; is the sequence in Burton. As in <em>A Tale of a Tub</em>, Swift&rsquo;s satire on
                religious diﬀerences refuses to acknowledge that genuine diﬀerences in belief might exist. In his satire
                and polemical writings Swift endorses religious uniformity in the state.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Whether Flesh be Bread, or Bread be Flesh</em>: compare the satire on Roman Catholicism and the doctrine
            of transubstantiation in <em>A Tale of a Tub</em>.<em> Whether Whistling . . . Virtue</em>: under the
            influence of the Presbyterians and the Independents during the Commonwealth (1649&ndash;60), organs and
            choirs were removed from the churches. PT.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Post</em>: an image or crucifix. Swift satirizes Papist idolatry and Puritan iconoclasm, as he had in the
            characters of Peter (Roman Catholicism) and Jack (Calvinism and Puritan Enthusiasm) in <em>A Tale of a
                Tub</em>. Gough (p. 415) and PT quote a Wycliﬃte saying that images had one use: &lsquo;thai myghtten
            warme a mans body in colde, if thai were sette upon a fire&rsquo;. Swift satire recalls instances of
            iconoclasm during the Civil Wars and Interregnum, especially the Puritan campaign against crosses, often
            destroyed in public bonfires, see Julie Spraggon, <em>Puritan Iconoclasm</em> <em>during the English Civil
                War</em> (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2003).</p>

        <p>resistance to the royal patent given to William Wood and to consider-ations about &lsquo;the best Way of
            murdering the King&rsquo; in the plots passage of Part III. Cf. Swift&rsquo;s correspondence in 1735 where
            king-killing is imagined and approved, see Williams, iv. 337). The Houyhnhnms do not blame the Yahoos for
            what they are but are pleased to consider their extermination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <li><em>Nature and Reason were su</em><em>ﬃ</em><em>cient Guides . . . Animal</em>: cf. More&rsquo;s
                Utopians: &lsquo;They define virtue as living according to nature; and God, they say, created us to that
                end. When an individual obeys the dictates of reason in choosing one thing and avoiding another, he is
                following nature&rsquo; (<em>Utopia</em>, 67). Swift, like More, is using a conception of reason derived
                from the Stoics, that of &lsquo;right reason&rsquo; which enables instinctive apprehension of the
                natural law. The Houyhnhnms are exemplars of stoic &lsquo;sociableness&rsquo; and hypothetical
                embodiments of the stoic-influenced state of nature described in the &lsquo;Prolegomena&rsquo; to Hugo
                Grotius&rsquo; <em>De Jure Belli ac Pacis</em>, a work Swift owned and recommended (see
                <em>Library</em>, Part I, vol. i, pp. 760&ndash; 6; , i. 615), where all obey what is enjoined by
                natural law without the necessity of divine injunction, Church, or scripture (see Hugo Grotius, <em>The
                    Law of War and Peace. De Jure Belli ac Pacis Libri Tres</em>, trans. Francis Kelsey (Oxford: Oxford
                University Press, 1925). Cf. More&rsquo;s Utopians, who live in accord with reason and nature:
                &lsquo;Human reason, they think, can attain to no truer conclusions than these, unless a revelation from
                heaven should inspire men with holier notions . . . But of this I am sure, that whatever their
                principles are, there is not a more excellent people or a happier commonwealth anywhere in the whole
                world&rsquo; (<em>Utopia</em>, 74). The Houyhnhnms exemplify what the Jacobite ideologist Chevalier
                Ramsay described as &lsquo;the Idea&rsquo; of a &lsquo;State . . . con-formable to reasonable
                Nature&rsquo;, the fictional &lsquo;Golden Age&rsquo;: &lsquo;IF Men, would follow the Law of Nature . .
                . they would have no occasion for positive Laws, nor exemplary Punishments: Reason would be the common
                Law; Men would live in Simplicity without Pride, in mutual Commerce without Propriety, and in Equality
                without Jealousy: They would know no other Superiority but that of Virtue, nor no other Ambition but
                that of being generous and disinterested.&rsquo; Ramsay thought &lsquo;Self-Love&rsquo; and the passions
                prevented humankind from living in such a state (<em>An Essay upon Civil Government</em> (London, 1722),
                36, 37). Swift makes the same point, for the order of the Houyhnhnms is non-human.</li>

        <p><em>I said there was a Society of Men among us</em>: the satire on lawyers is much softer in the first
            edition published by Motte (who was a publisher of legal works). Ridicule of law and lawyers was a
            traditional satiric topos. However, Swift&rsquo;s animus was undoubtedly intensified, as PT observes, by the
            conduct of Lord Chief Justice Whitshed who, when Edward Waters was prosecuted for printing Swift&rsquo;s
            <em>A Proposal for the Universal</em> <em>Use of Irish Manufactures</em> (1720), refused to accept a verdict
            of not guilty, sent the jury back nine times, and kept them for eleven hours; and who in 1724 dissolved the
            Grand Jury, because they refused to present Swift&rsquo;s</p>

        <p><em>Seasonable Advice</em> as a seditious paper. Gulliver&rsquo;s extreme claim that hereditary title in

            (e.g. Ramsay, <em>An Essay</em> <em>upon Civil Government</em>, 65&ndash;6). It is perhaps revealing of
            Swift&rsquo;s train of thought that Gulliver immediately starts talking about the arbitrary way treason
            trials are conducted after asserting that hereditary title to property is disregarded.</p>

        <p><em>a young Female Yahoo</em>: the episode has been variously construed: as a bestiality scene of man-beast
            sexual contact, as a rape scene with the male as victim, as an evocation of the scenario of European male
            sexual encounters with native women, as an ironic adaptation of the &lsquo;Adam and Eve&rsquo; bathing pools
            in Bacon&rsquo;s <em>The New Atlantis</em> where prospective husbands and wives inspect their intended mates
            nude (PT), and as a parody of Echo&rsquo;s wooing of Narcissus in Book III of Ovid&rsquo;s<em>
                Metamorphoses</em>. For detailed contextual analysis of the episode, see Paul-Gabriel Bouc&eacute;,
            &lsquo;The Rape of Gulliver Reconsidered&rsquo;, 98&ndash;114;<em> GGG</em>, 92&ndash;182. As Gulliver
            recognizes, the main implication of this nar-rative episode is that it shows that Gulliver has biological
            kinship with the brutal, unreasoning Yahoos. He is recognized by Yahoos, as well as by the Houyhnhnms, as
            belonging to the Yahoo species.</p>

                &lsquo;Of the Education of Ladies&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> 225&ndash;8). The Houyhnhnm Master&rsquo;s
                senti-ments were shared by contemporary women writers such as Anne Ingram, Viscountess Irwin, who

        <p><em>Representative Council . . . Nation</em>: cf. &lsquo;the general council of the whole island&rsquo;
            (<em>Utopia</em>, 48). In the Utopian general council or senate, which has representatives from each
            district, &lsquo;they first determine where there are shortages and surpluses, and promptly satisfy one
            district&rsquo;s shortage with another&rsquo;s surplus . . . Thus the whole island is like a single
            family&rsquo; (<em>Utopia</em>, 59). The Houyhnhnms exemplify that &lsquo;rule of the law of nature&rsquo;
            to abide by pacts and to conform to what the majority, or those upon whom authority is conferred, have
            determined (Grotius<em>, De Jure Belli ac</em> <em>Pacis Libri Tres</em>, trans. Francis Kelsey,

                and Swift&rsquo;s own punitive extremism in works such as <em>A Proposal for Giving Badges to the
                    Beggars</em> where &lsquo;strolling Beggars&rsquo; from the country are said to be &lsquo;a most
                insuﬀerable Nuisance, being nothing else but a profligate Clan of Thieves, Drunkards, Heathens, and
                Whoremongers, fitter to be rooted out oﬀ the Face of the Earth&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> 138&ndash;9). On
                Swift&rsquo;s rhetorical extremism, see <em>GGG</em>,<em> passim</em>, but esp. pp. 256&ndash;66. Cf. in
                a comic context, Cervantes, <em>Don Quixote</em>, i. viii. 63: &lsquo;For this is a just war, and it is

        <p>255 <em>In Poetry . . . Mortals</em>: Houyhnhnm poetry and its subjects seem modelled on that in Ancient
            Sparta which had no written literature, but did have a flourishing oral poetic tradition. The subjects of
            Houyhnhnm poetry are what Lycurgus and Plato approved, and what Pindar cele-brated (&lsquo;Lycurgus&rsquo;,
            xxi; <em>Republic</em>, 390d; Swift&rsquo;s earliest poems were Pindaric odes. PT). Cf. also Montaigne,
            <em>Essays</em>, i. 31 (Montaigne, 158).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>the obscurest Places . . . Grief</em>: Swift&rsquo;s Will contains a request to be buried &lsquo;as
                privately as possible, and at Twelve o&rsquo;Clock at Night&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> 149). He also expressed
                a wish to be buried obscurely at Holyhead (<em>Poems</em>, ii. 421). He seems to have made no public
                show of his very real grief at the death of his dearest friend Esther Johnson. The Utopians approve when
                people die blithely and they do not mourn such deaths, rather they celebrate such souls
                (<em>Utopia</em>, 96). The Houyhnhnm approach to death is what Montaigne admired and Montaigne points to
                the kind of signifi-cance Swift&rsquo;s account of the Houyhnhnms implies. Montaigne wrote
                (<em>Essays</em>, ii. 12, &lsquo;Apology for Raymond Sebond&rsquo;): &lsquo;What they tell us of the
                Brazilians, that they died only of old age, which is attributed to the serenity and tranquillity of
                their air, I attribute rather to the tranquillity and serenity of their souls, unburdened with any tense
                or unpleasant passion or thought or occupation, as people who spent their life in admir-able simplicity
                and ignorance, without letters, without law, without king, without religion of any kind&rsquo;
                (Montaigne, 362).</li>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>upon returning</em>: PT quotes Cornelius Nepos, <em>Life of Atticus</em>, xxii. 1&ndash;2: &lsquo;all
            this he said with so steady a voice and countenance, that he seemed to be passing, not out of life, but
            merely from one house to another&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>She died about three Months after</em>: although she is outwardly stoical, there may be a subtle
            suggestion here that she dies of a broken heart.</p>

        <p><em>I enjoyed . . . Enemy</em>: cf. <em>Utopia</em>, 105 on &lsquo;the happiness of the Utopian republic,
            which has abolished not only money but with it greed! What a mass of trouble was cut away by that one step!
            What a thicket of crimes was uprooted! Everyone knows that if money were abolished, fraud, theft, robbery,
            quarrels, brawls, altercations, seditions, murders, treasons, poisonings and a whole set of crimes which are
            avenged but not pre-vented by the hangman would at once die out . . .&rsquo;. On Swift&rsquo;s lists and

            <em>on Conversation</em> were the &lsquo;two chief Ends of Conversation . . . to entertain and improve those
            we are among, or to receive those Benefits ourselves&rsquo;. Swift condemned &lsquo;the Itch of Dispute and
            Contradiction&rsquo; and &lsquo;telling of Lies&rsquo; in conversation (<em>PW</em> iv. 92, 94).</p>

            Like the young people in Utopia, Gulliver is the auditor at improving table conversation and is drawn into
            the conversation with questions (<em>Utopia</em>, 58). Swift&rsquo;s principal satiric exhibit of debased
            conversation was &lsquo;at Court, and in the Best Companies of England&rsquo;, see his satiric anthology
            from a lifetime of collecting, <em>A Complete Collection of Genteel and Ingenious</em> <em>Conversation</em>
            (<em>PW</em> iv. 97&ndash;201).</p>

                (<em>Paradise Lost</em>, iv. 460&ndash;71) and Narcissus who fell in love with his own reflection in the
                water (Ovid, <em>Metamorphoses</em>, iii. 402&ndash;36), Gulliver hates the image of fallen humanity
                that he sees. Gulliver&rsquo;s abhorrence of the self he beholds has striking analogues in Christian
                rhetoric on humanity deformed by sin, see Frye, &lsquo;Swift&rsquo;s Yahoo and the Christian Symbols for
                Sin&rsquo;, 206&ndash;8. PT interprets the scene as &lsquo;an ironical adaptation of a stock passage in
                pastoral love poetry (Theocritus, vi. 34&ndash;8; Virgil, <em>Eclogues</em>, ii. 25&ndash;6; Pope,
                <em>Pastorals</em>, ii. 27&ndash;30) where the unsuccessful lover (Polyphemus, Corydon, &ldquo;A
                Shepherd&rsquo;s Boy&rdquo;) looks at himself (in the sea, a &ldquo;crystal spring&rdquo;) to check that
                he is not really so very unattractive. Gulliver has fallen in love with the Houyhnhnms, but feels a
                Cyclops to their Galatea.&rsquo;</li>

                &lsquo;frequently bewailed his Return to the World, which could not, he said, with all its Enjoyments,

                where he is, but the reader can have considerable diﬃculty finding him.</li>

                his country in a Portuguese ship (<em>Utopia</em>, 10&ndash;11). Mendez is the name of Portuguese
                sailors in the 1625 edition of <em>Purchas His</em> <em>Pilgrimes</em> which Swift owned. Swift had
                Portuguese cousins (Williams, v. 58). Dampier commented in <em>A Voyage to New Holland</em> that many of
                &lsquo;the Portuguez, who are Batchelors&rsquo; have &lsquo;black Women for Misses&rsquo;
                (<em>Voyages</em>, ii. 386), but Swift&rsquo;s Portuguese bachelor appears austere and chaste. The good
                generous Captain from a Catholic country oﬀers a stark contrast to the perfidious Calvinist Protestant
                Dutchman in Part III. Mendez is a prominent patronymic among Sephardim (Jews who settled in Spain and
                Portugal), Marranos (secret Jews who appeared ostensibly Christian), and Jews who were Catholic
                Christian converts, and Swift may have chosen the name to suggest an outsider or a diasporic outcast
                figure who is the Good Samaritan to Gulliver (see Maurice A. G&eacute;racht, &lsquo;Pedro De Mendez:
                Marrano Jew and Good Samaritan in Swift&rsquo;s <em>Voyages</em>&rsquo;, <em>Swift</em>

            omitted by Faulkner in 1735, presumably to avoid a doubt about Houyhnhnm veracity, since they have told
            Gulliver: &lsquo;That no European did ever visit these Countries before me.&rsquo; In the passage Don Pedro,
            like the Houyhnhnms, rejects out of hand the idea of a society where the roles of horse and human are

            <em>Portugal</em>&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> ii. 160). Gulliver&rsquo;s book might be understood by an Inquisition
            as blasphemy against Genesis 1: 27, 28 where it is said that &lsquo;God created man in his own image&rsquo;
            and with &lsquo;dominion&rsquo; over all living things on earth.</p>

            sociability, friendship, and benevolence. The Houyhnhnm Master did</p>

        <p>not treat his wife and family with contempt. In having Gulliver impu-dently acting as if he was God and in
            recoiling from &lsquo;Yahoos&rsquo;, Swift may be recalling Montaigne (<em>Essays</em>, ii. 12,
            &lsquo;Apology for Raymond Sebond&rsquo;): &lsquo;There is not one of us who is so oﬀended to see himself
            compared to God as he is to see himself brought down to the rank of the other animals&rsquo; (Montaigne,
            361). Swift&rsquo;s traveller boasts of his reason but from having looked on the light for a long time has
            become disorientated, blinded rather than enlightened. At the moment Gulliver cannot distinguish true reason
            and virtue from a prejudiced and bigoted monomania. In Gulliver&rsquo;s absurd antics Swift is making a
            further misan-thropic point: even when shown a life of reason in accord with nature humankind is unable to
            truly imitate it.</p>

                Hythloday, like Gulliver, &lsquo;told us of many ill-considered usages in these new-found nations, he
                also described quite a few other customs from which our own cities, nations, races and kingdoms might
                take lessons in order to correct their errors . . .</li>

            <li><em>Nec si miserum . . .</em><em> fi</em><em>nget</em>: nor, if Fortune has made Sinon for misery, will
                she also in her spite make him false and a liar (Virgil, <em>Aeneid</em>, ii. 79&ndash;80). The Greek
                Sinon tells a famous lie which persuades the Trojans to take the wooden horse (full of Greeks) within
                the walls of their city and this leads to the destruction of Troy. Gulliver is Swift&rsquo;s magnificent
                liar who tells a gloriously false tale. His Greek-model (i.e. Spartan and Platonic) horses would, if
                their principles were introduced, destroy modern Troy (London). Swift elsewhere imagines the destruction
                of corrupt modern Britain. In <em>An Argument against Abolishing Christianity</em>, for example,
                Swift&rsquo;s sardonic irony supposes that the introduction of real Christianity would &lsquo;break the
                entire Frame and Constitution of Things&rsquo; and &lsquo;turn our Courts, Exchanges and Shops into
                Desarts&rsquo;, and approves Horace&rsquo;s proposal to the corrupt Romans &lsquo;to leave their City,
                and seek a new Seat in some remote Part of the World&rsquo; (<em>PW</em> 27&ndash;8). Alluding to the
                <em>Aeneid</em> (ii. 311&ndash;12) in a letter to his friend Charles Ford, a Jacobite, Swift obliquely
                implies that his main worry if a Jacobite invasion takes place is that the flames in sacked Troy
                (Britain) might spread to his Deanry-house in Ireland (16 February 1719, <em>Corr</em>., ii. 291).</li>

            is partly because the princes are all so just and virtuous, partly also from the awe and reverence that
            everyone feels for the popes.&rsquo; Swift is also parodying contemporary Whig-speak praising British
            colonialism. The loyal Old Whig journal, <em>Cato&rsquo;s Letters</em>, for example, found English liberty
            exempli-fied in Britain&rsquo;s productive American slave plantations: &lsquo;the English planters in
            America, besides maintaining themselves and ten times as many Negroes, maintain likewise great numbers of
            their countrymen in England. Such are the blessings of liberty, and such is the diﬀerence which it makes
            between country and country!&rsquo; (<em>Cato&rsquo;s Letters</em>, no. 67, 24 Feb. 172[2], 474, in John

            the English, whom he would depict in another satiric masterpiece, <em>A Modest Proposal</em>, as cannibal
            oppressors who would eat the cannibal savage Irish. Faulkner omitted the passage. Swift may have thought
            that it seemed to contradict Houyhnhnm veracity, as they have said that no Europeans had been to their
            country, or Faulkner may have thought the insult to the English was too specific (after all, the idea that
            the Yahoos are partly based on the native Irish is never explicitly stated).</p>
