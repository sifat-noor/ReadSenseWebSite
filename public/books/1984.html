        <p><strong>* Chapter One *</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled
            into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory
            Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for
            indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide:
            the face of man of about forty&minus;five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made
            for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at
            present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in
            preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty&minus;nine and had
            a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing,
            opposite the lift&minus;shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of
            those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS
            WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.</p>

        </ul> -->
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the
            production of pig&minus;iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed
            part of the surface of the right&minus;hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat,
            though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed,
            but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure,
            the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His
            hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades
            and the cold of the winter that had just ended.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Outside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked
            cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was
            shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except; the posters that were
            plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the
            house&minus;front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the
            dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another
            poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a
            helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a
            bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the
            Thought Police mattered.</p>

        <p>Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig&minus;iron and the
            overfulfilment of the Ninth Three&minus;Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously.
            Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so
            long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as
            heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often,
            or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even
            conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever
            they wanted to. You had to live did live, from habit that became instinct in the assumption that every sound
            you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be
            revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy
            landscape. This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste this was London, chief city of Airstrip One,
            itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory
            that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these vistas of
            rotting nineteenth&minus;century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, their windows patched
            with</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? And the
            bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow&minus;herb straggled over the heaps of
            rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of
            wooden dwellings like chicken&minus;houses? But it was no use, he could not remember: nothing remained of
            his childhood except a series of bright&minus;lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly
            unintelligible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Ministry of Truth& Minitrue, in Newspeak* was startlingly
            different from any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300
            metres into the air. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in
            elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WAR IS PEACE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding
            ramifications below. Scattered about London there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and
            size. So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you
            could see all four of them simultaneously. They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the
            entire apparatus of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news,
            entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war. The
            Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for
            economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows in it at all. Winston had never
            been inside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter
            except on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed&minus;wire entanglements,
            steel doors, and hidden machine&minus;gun nests. Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were
            roamed by gorilla&minus;faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was
            advisable to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the
            Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">2</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark&minus;coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's
            breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY
            GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese ricespirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful,
            nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and
            moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club.
            The next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. He
            took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright,
            whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful. He went back to the
            living&minus;room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From the table
            drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto&minus;sized blank book with a red back
            and a marbled cover.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For some reason the telescreen in the living&minus;room was in an unusual position. Instead of being placed,
            as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite
            the window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when
            the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping
            well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be
            heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the
            unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly
            beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been
            manufactured for at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that.
            He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk&minus;shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what
            quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess
            it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops ('dealing on the free market', it was called),
            but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades,
            which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He had given a quick glance up and down the street
            and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious of
            wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothing
            written in it, it was a compromising possession. </p>    
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>April 4th, 1984.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To begin with, he did not know with any
            certainty that this was 1984. It must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was
            thirty&minus;nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible nowadays
            to pin down any date within a year or two.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this
            diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against
            the Newspeak word <em>doublethink.</em> For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home
            to him. How could you communicate with the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the future would
            resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it, and his
            predicament would be meaningless.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The telescreen had changed over to strident military
            music. It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to
            have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks past he had been making ready
            for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual
            writing would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that
            had been running inside his head, literally for years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried
            up. Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it, because if he did so
            it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of
            the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight
            booziness caused by the gin.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down. His small but
            childish handwriting straggled up and down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its
            full stops:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                trying to swim away with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a

                round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience
                shouting with laughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering

        <p>Winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. He did not know what had made him pour
            out this stream of rubbish. But the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory
            had clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down. It was, he now
            realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary
            today.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so nebulous could be said to
            happen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records
            Department, where Winston worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in
            preparation for the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">4</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>    
        <p>people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was
            a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the
            Fiction Department. Presumably since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner
            she had some mechanical job on one of the novel&minus;writing machines. She was a bold&minus;looking girl, of about
            twenty&minus; seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem
            of the Junior Anti&minus;Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough
            to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her.
            He knew the reason. It was because of the atmosphere of hockey&minus;fields and cold baths and community hikes
            and general clean&minus; mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked nearly all women,
            and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were
            the most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers&minus;out of
            unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. Once when
            they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and
            for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent
            of the Thought Police. That, it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness,
            which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and holder of some post so important
            and remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people
            round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching. O'Brien was a large,
            burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he
            had a certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously
            disarming in some indefinable way, curiously civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought
            in such terms, might have recalled an eighteenth&minus;century nobleman offering his snuffbox. Winston had
            seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely
            because he was intrigued by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize&minus;fighter's
            physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope
            that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And
            again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply intelligence. But at any
            rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the
            telescreen and get him alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there
            was no way of doing so. At this moment O'Brien glanced at his wrist&minus;watch, saw that it was nearly
            eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over.
            He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away. A small, sandy&minus;haired woman who
            worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately
            behind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine running without oil, burst from the
            big telescreen at the end of the room. It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at
            the back of one's neck. The Hate had started.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had flashed on to the screen. There were
            hisses here and there among the audience. The little sandy&minus;haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear
            and disgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite
            remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself,
            and then had engaged in counter&minus;revolutionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day,
            but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor, the earliest
            defiler of the Party's purity. All subsequent crimes against the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies,
            deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his
            conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">5</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>even so it was occasionally rumoured in some hiding&minus;place in Oceania itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of
            emotions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard a
            clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose,
            near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice,
            too, had a sheep&minus;like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines
            of the Party an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and
            yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level&minus;headed
            than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the
            Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech,
            freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the
            revolution had been betrayed and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the
            habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed,
            than any Party member would normally use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as
            to the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched
            the endless columns of the Eurasian army row after row of solid&minus;looking men with expressionless
            Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly
            similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the background to Goldstein's bleating voice.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out
            from half the people in the room. The self&minus;satisfied sheep&minus;like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of
            the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or even the thought of Goldstein
            produced fear and anger automatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or
            Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other.
            But what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day
            and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were
            refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all
            this, his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him. A
            day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought
            Police. He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of conspirators dedicated to
            the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories
            of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author and which circulated
            clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as the
            book. But one knew of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor <em> the book </em>was a
            subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">6</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary,
            against Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his heart went out to the
            lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the
            very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him
            to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother
            seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia, and
            Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence,
            seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of
            civilization.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by
            the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston
            succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark&minus;haired girl behind him.
            Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind. He would flog her to death with a rubber
            truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would
            ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was
            that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed
            with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it
            with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant
            the face changed into that of a sheep. Then the sheep&minus;face melted into the figure of a Eurasian
            soldier who seemed to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub&minus;machine gun roaring, and seeming to
            spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched
            backwards in their seats. But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile
            figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black&minus;haired, blackmoustachio'd, full of power and
            mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.
            It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not
            distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big
            Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WAR IS PEACE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it
            had made on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandyhaired woman had
            flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a tremulous murmur that sounded like
            'My Saviour!' she extended her arms towards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was
            apparent that she was uttering a prayer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow,
            rhythmical chant of 'B&minus;B! . . . B&minus;B!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first 'B' and the second&minus;a heavy,
            murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked
            feet and the throbbing of tom&minus;toms. For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a
            refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom
            and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self&minus;hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness
            by means of rhythmic noise. Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not
            help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub&minus;human chanting of 'B&minus; B! . . . B&minus;B !' always filled him with
            horror. Of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">7</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. But there was a space of
            a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And it was
            exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened if, indeed, it did happen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stood up. He had taken off his spectacles and was in the
            act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when
            their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew&minus;yes, he knew !&minus;that O'Brien was thinking
            the same thing as himself. An unmistakable message had passed. It was as though their two minds had
            opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. 'I am with you,' O'Brien
            seemed to be saying to him. 'I know precisely what you are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your
            hatred, your disgust. But don't worry, I am on your side!' And then the flash of intelligence was gone, and
            O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such incidents never had any sequel. All
            that they did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the
            Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all perhaps the Brotherhood
            really existed ! It was impossible, in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure
            that the Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days not. There was no
            evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation,
            faint scribbles on lavatory walls once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand which
            had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined
            everything. He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at O'Brien again. The idea of following up their
            momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had
            known how to set about doing it. For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and
            that was the end of the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which one had
            to live.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a belch. The gin was rising from his
            stomach.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His eyes re focused on the page. He discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he
            had also been writing, as though by automatic action. And it was no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen
            had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>over and over again, filling half a page.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He could not help feeling a twinge of panic. It was absurd, since the writing of those particular words was
            not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out
            the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. Whether he wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or
            whether he refrained from writing it, made no difference. Whether he went on with the diary,</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">8</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>or whether he did not go on with it, made no difference. The Thought Police would get him just the same. He
            had committed would still have committed, even if he had never set pen to paper the essential crime that
            contained all others in itself. Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be
            concealed for ever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were
            bound to get you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was always at night the arrests invariably happened at night. The sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand
            shaking your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. In the vast
            majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. People simply disappeared, always during the
            night. Your name was removed from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out,
            your one&minus;time existence was denied and then forgotten. You were abolished, annihilated:
            <em>vaporized</em> was the usual word.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began&nbsp; writing&nbsp; in a hurried untidy scrawl:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother
                they always shoot you in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down the pen. The next moment he started
            violently. There was a knocking at the door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Already! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single
            attempt. But no, the knocking was repeated. The worst thing of all would be to delay. His heart was thumping
            like a drum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless. He got up and moved heavily towards
            the door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As he put his hand to the door&minus;knob Winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table. DOWN WITH
            BIG BROTHER was written all over it, in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. It was an
            inconceivably stupid thing to have done. But, he realized, even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the
            creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him. A colourless,
            crushed&minus;looking woman, with wispy hair and a lined face, was standing outside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Oh, comrade,' she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, 'I thought I heard you come in. Do you think you
            could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink? It's got blocked up and&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor. ('Mrs' was a word somewhat discountenanced by
            the Party you were supposed to call everyone 'comrade' but with some women one used it instinctively.) She
            was a woman of about thirty, but looking much older. One had the impression that there was dust in the
            creases of her face. Winston followed her down the passage. These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily
            irritation. Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were falling to pieces. The
            plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls, the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked
            whenever there was snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down
            altogether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what you could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by
            remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a window&minus; pane for two years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Of course it's only because Tom&nbsp; isn't&nbsp; home,'&nbsp; said&nbsp; Mrs&nbsp; Parsons&nbsp; vaguely.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">9</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Parsons' flat was bigger than Winston's, and dingy in a different way. Everything had a battered,
            trampled&minus;on look, as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal. Games
            impedimenta hockey&minus;sticks, boxing&minus;gloves. a burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turned
            inside out lay all over the floor, and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog&minus;eared
            exercise&minus;books. On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, and a full&minus;sized poster of Big Brother.
            There was the usual boiled&minus;cabbage smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a
            sharper reek of sweat, which&minus;one knew this at the first sniff, though it was hard to say how was the
            sweat of some person not present at the moment. In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep
            tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's the children,' said Mrs Parsons, casting a half&minus; apprehensive glance at the door. 'They haven't
            been out today. And of course&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. The kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim
            with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage. Winston knelt down and examined the
            angle&minus;joint of the pipe. He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was always liable
            to start him coughing. Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Of course if Tom was home he'd put it right in a moment,' she said. 'He loves anything like that. He's ever
            so good with his hands, Tom is.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Parsons was Winston's fellow&minus;employee at the Ministry of Truth. He was a fattish but active man of
            paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party depended. At
            thirty&minus;five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the Youth League, and before graduating into the
            Youth League he had managed to stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age. At the Ministry he was employed in
            some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required, but on the other hand he was a leading figure
            on the Sports Committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes, spontaneous
            demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary activities generally. He would inform you with quiet pride,
            between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the Community Centre every evening for the
            past four years. An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his
            life, followed him about wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Have you got a spanner? said Winston, fiddling with the nut on the angle joint.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'A spanner,' said Mrs Parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate. 'I don't know, I'm sure. Perhaps the
            children &minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children charged into the
            living&minus;room. Mrs Parsons brought the spanner. Winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the
            clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe. He cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water
            from the tap and went back into the other room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Up with your hands!' yelled a savage voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A handsome, tough&minus;looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a
            toy automatic pistol, while his small sister, about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment
            of wood. Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and red neckerchiefs which were the
            uniform of the Spies. Winston raised his hands above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was
            the boy's demeanour, that it was not altogether a game.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">10</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You're a traitor!' yelled the boy. 'You're a thought&minus; criminal! You're a Eurasian spy! I'll shoot you,
            I'll vaporize you, I'll send you to the salt mines!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting 'Traitor!' and 'Thought&minus;criminal!' the little girl
            imitating her brother in every movement. It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of tiger
            cubs which will soon grow up into man&minus;eaters. There was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy's
            eye, a quite evident desire to hit or kick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do
            so. It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston thought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs Parsons' eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children, and back again. In the better light of the
            living&minus;room he noticed with interest that there actually <em>was</em> dust in the creases of her face.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'They do get so noisy,' she said. 'They're disappointed because they couldn't go to see the hanging, that's
            what it is. I'm too busy to take them. and Tom won't be back from work in time.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Why can't we go and see the hanging?' roared the boy in his huge voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Want to see the hanging ! Want to see the hanging!' chanted the little girl, still capering round.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the Park that evening, Winston
            remembered. This happened about once a month, and was a popular spectacle. Children always clamoured to
            be taken to see it. He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door. But he had not gone six steps
            down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow. It was as though a
            red&minus;hot wire had been jabbed into him. He spun round just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her son back
            into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Goldstein!' bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. But what most struck Winston was the look of
            helpless fright on the woman's greyish face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the table again, still rubbing his
            neck. The music from the telescreen had stopped. Instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a
            sort of brutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress which had just been
            anchored between lceland and the Faroe lslands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of terror. Another year, two years, and
            they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were
            horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spies they were
            systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever
            to rebel against the discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything
            connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the
            yelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their
            ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs,
            thought&minus;criminals. It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children.
            And with good reason, for hardly a week passed in which <em>The Times</em> did not carry a paragraph
            describing how some eavesdropping little sneak 'child hero' was the phrase generally used had overheard some
            compromising remark and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked up his pen half&minus;heartedly, wondering whether
            he could find something more to write in the diary. Suddenly he began thinking of O'Brien again.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">11</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Years ago how long was it? Seven years it must be he had dreamed that he was walking through a
            pitch&minus;dark room. And someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed: 'We shall meet in the
            place where there is no darkness.' It was said very quietly, almost casually a statement, not a command. He
            had walked on without pausing. What was curious was that at the time, in the dream, the words had not made
            much impression on him. It was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. He
            could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen O'Brien for the
            first time, nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as O'Brien's. But at any rate the
            identification existed. It was O'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston had never been able to feel sure even after this morning's flash
            flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O'Brien was a friend or an enemy. Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There was a link
            of understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship. 'We shall meet in the place
            where there is no darkness,' he had said. Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or
            another it would come true.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The voice from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call, clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air. The
            voice continued raspingly:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Attention! Your attention, please ! A newsflash has this moment arrived from the Malabar front. Our forces
            in South India have won a glorious victory. I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may
            well bring the war within measurable distance of its end. Here is the newsflash &minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bad news coming, thought Winston. And sure enough, following on a gory description of the annihilation of
            a Eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next
            week, the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston belched again. The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling. The telescreen perhaps to
            celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate crashed into 'Oceania, 'tis for
            thee'. You were supposed to stand to attention. However, in his present position he was invisible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Oceania, 'tis for thee' gave way to lighter music. Winston walked over to the window, keeping his back to
            the telescreen. The day was still cold and clear. Somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull,
            reverberating roar. About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London at present.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and the word INGSOC fitfully appeared and
            vanished. Ingsoc. The sacred principles of Ingsoc. Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past. He
            felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he
            himself was the monster. He was alone. The past was dead, the future was unimaginable. What certainty had he
            that a single human creature now living was on his side? And what way of knowing that the dominion of the
            Party would not endure <em>for ever?</em> Like an answer, the three slogans on the white face of the
            Ministry of Truth came back to him:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WAR IS PEACE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He took a twenty&minus;five cent piece out of his pocket. There, too, in tiny clear lettering, the same
            slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of the coin the head of Big Brother. Even from the coin the
            eyes pursued you. On coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on the wrappings
            of a cigarette</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">12</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Packet everywhere. Always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, working or
            eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed no escape. Nothing was your own except the few cubic
            centimetres inside your skull.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the Ministry of Truth, with the light no longer shining
            on them, looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress. His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape.
            It was too strong, it could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down. He wondered
            again for whom he was writing the diary. For the future, for the past for an age that might be imaginary.
            And in front of him there lay not death but annihilation. The diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to
            vapour. Only the Thought Police would read what he had written, before they wiped it out of existence and
            out of memory. How could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an anonymous word
            scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The telescreen struck fourteen. He must leave in ten minutes. He
            had to be back at work by fourteen&minus;thirty.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him. He was a lonely ghost uttering a
            truth that nobody would ever hear. But so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not
            broken. It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage. He
            went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and
                do not live alone to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone:</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age of doublethink
            greetings !</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that it was only now, when he had begun to be able to
            formulate his thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step. The consequences of every act are included in
            the act itself. He wrote:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime</em> IS <em>death.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible. Two
            fingers of his right hand were inkstained. It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. Some
            nosing zealot in the Ministry (a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy&minus; haired woman or the
            dark&minus;haired girl from the Fiction Department) might start wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval,
            why he had used an oldfashioned pen, <em>what</em> he had been writing and then drop a hint in the
            appropriate quarter. He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty
            dark&minus;brown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite useless to think of hiding it, but he could at least make
            sure whether or not its existence had been discovered. A hair laid across the page&minus;ends was too
            obvious. With the tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on
            the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shaken off if the book was moved.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston was dreaming of his mother.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared. She was a tall,
            statuesque, rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">13</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>more vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered especially the very
            thin soles of his father's shoes) and wearing spectacles. The two of them must evidently have been swallowed
            up in one of the first great purges of the fifties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this; moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him, with his
            young sister in her arms. He did not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large,
            watchful eyes. Both of them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean place the bottom of
            a well, for instance, or a very deep grave but it was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving
            downwards. They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening water. There
            was still air in the saloon, they could still see him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down,
            down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever. He was out in the
            light and air while they were being sucked down to death, and they were down there <em>because</em> he was
            up here. He knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no reproach either in
            their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive,
            and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He could not remember what had happened, but he
            knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own. It
            was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery, are a continuation of one's
            intellectual life, and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after
            one is awake. The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his mother's death, nearly thirty years
            ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to
            the ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of a
            family stood by one another without needing to know the reason. His mother's memory tore at his heart because
            she had died loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and because somehow, he
            did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable.
            Such things, he saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of
            emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his
            sister, looking up at him through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded
            the ground. The landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully
            certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden
            Country. It was an old, rabbit&minus;bitten pasture, with a foot&minus;track wandering across it and a
            molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees
            were swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women's hair.
            Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight, there was a clear, slow&minus;moving stream where dace were
            swimming in the pools under the willow trees.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. With what seemed a single movement she tore
            off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire
            in him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside. With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a
            whole culture, a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could
            all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm. That too was a gesture belonging to
            the ancient time. Winston woke up with the word <em>'Shakespeare'</em> on his lips.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The telescreen was giving forth an ear&minus;splitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds.
            It was nought seven fifteen, getting&minus;up time for office workers. Winston wrenched his body out of bed 
            naked, for a member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually, and a suit of pyjamas
            was 600 and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">14</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>would begin in three minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly
            always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin
            breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort
            of the cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Thirty to forty group!' yapped a piercing female voice. ' Thirty to forty group! Take your places, please. Thirties to forties!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny
            but muscular, dressed in tunic and gym&minus;shoes, had already appeared.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Arms bending and stretching!' she rapped out. 'Take your time by me. <em>One,</em> two, three, four! <em>One,</em> two, three,
            four! Come on, comrades, put a bit of life into it! <em>One,</em> two, three four! <em>One,</em> two, three, four! . . .'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Winston's mind the impression made by his dream,
            and the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat. As he mechanically shot his arms back
            and forth, wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the Physical
            Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood. It was
            extraordinarily difficult. Beyond the late fifties everything faded. When there were no external records that
            you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness. You remembered huge events which
            had quite probably not happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their
            atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing. Everything had been
            different then. Even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One, for
            instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called England or Britain, though London, he felt
            fairly certain, had always been called London.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war, but it was evident that
            there had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of
            an air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had
            fallen on Colchester. He did not remember the raid itself, but he did remember his father's hand clutching his
            own as they hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round a spiral staircase
            which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to
            stop and rest. His mother, in her slow, dreamy way, was following a long way behind them. She was carrying
            his baby sister or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying: he was not certain whether
            his sister had been born then. Finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had realized to
            be a Tube station.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were people sitting all over the stone&minus;flagged floor, and other people, packed tightly together,
            were sitting on metal bunks, one above the other. Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place
            on the floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk. The old man had
            on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and his
            eyes were blue and full of tears. He reeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat, and
            one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly drunk he was
            also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. In his childish way Winston grasped that
            some terrible thing, something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened.
            It also seemed to him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the old man loved a little granddaughter,
            perhaps had been killed. Every few minutes the old man kept repeating:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We didn't ought to 'ave trusted 'em. I said so, Ma, didn't I? That's what comes of trusting 'em. I said so all
            along. We didn't ought to 'ave trusted the buggers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">15</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But which buggers they didn't ought to have trusted Winston could not now remember.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the
            same war. For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself,
            some of which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole period, to say who was
            fighting whom at any given moment, would have been utterly impossible, since no written record, and no
            spoken word, ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for example,
            in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or
            private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different
            lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and
            in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess
            because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never
            happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The
            enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with
            him was impossible.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward
            (with hands on hips, they were gyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be
            good for the back muscles) the frightening thing was that it might all be true. If the Party could thrust
            its hand into the past and say of this or that event, <em>it never happened</em> that, surely, was more
            terrifying than mere torture and death?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had
            been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in
            his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all others accepted the lie which
            the Party imposed &minus;if all records told the same tale then the lie passed into history and became
            truth. 'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present
            controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was
            true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending
            series of victories over your own memory. 'Reality control', they called it: in Newspeak, 'doublethink'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Stand easy!' barked the instructress, a little more genially.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air. His mind slid away into the
            labyrinthine world of doublethink. To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while
            telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to
            be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while
            laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of
            democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the
            moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to
            the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once
            again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word
            'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The instructress had called them to attention again. 'And now let's see which of us can touch our toes!' she
            said enthusiastically. 'Right over from the hips, please, comrades. <em>One&minus;</em>two!
            <em>One&minus;</em> two! . . .'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often
            ended by bringing on another coughing fit. The half&minus;pleasant quality went out of his meditations. The
            past, he reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. For how could you establish
            even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory? He tried to remember in
            what</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">16</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>year he had first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but
            it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and
            guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in
            time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the
            capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in great gleaming motor&minus;cars or
            horse carriages with glass sides. There was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much
            invented. Winston could not even remember at what date the Party itself had come into existence. He did not
            believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before 1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak
            form&minus;'English Socialism', that is to say it had been current earlier. Everything melted into mist.
            Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was not true, for example, as was claimed
            in the Party history books, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his
            earliest childhood. But you could prove nothing. There was never any evidence. Just once in his whole life
            he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact. And on
            that occasion</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Smith !' screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W.! Yes, <em>you!</em>
            Bend lower, please! You can do better than that. You're not trying. Lower, please! <em>That's</em> better, comrade. Now stand at
            ease, the whole squad, and watch me.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston's body. His face remained completely inscrutable. Never
            show dismay! Never show resentment! A single flicker of the eyes could give you away. He stood watching
            while the instructress raised her arms above her head and one could not say gracefully, but with remarkable
            neatness and efficiency bent over and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>'There,</em> comrades! <em>That's</em> how I want to see you doing it. Watch me again. I'm
            thirty&minus;nine and I've had four children. Now look.' She bent over again. 'You see my knees aren't bent.
            You can all do it if you want to,' she added as she straightened herself up. 'Anyone under forty&minus; five
            is perfectly capable of touching his toes. We don't all have the privilege of fighting in the front line,
            but at least we can all keep fit. Remember our boys on the Malabar front! And the sailors in the Floating
            Fortresses! Just think what <em>they</em> have to put up with. Now try again. That's better, comrade, that's <em>much</em> better,' she added encouragingly as Winston, with a
            violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first time in several years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With the deep, unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen could prevent him from uttering
            when his day's work started, Winston pulled the speakwrite towards him, blew the dust from its mouthpiece,
            and put on his spectacles. Then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had
            already flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right&minus;hand side of his desk.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube
            for written messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of
            Winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of waste
            paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every
            room but at short</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any
            document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an
            automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled
            away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the
            building.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled. Each contained a message of only one or two
            lines, in the abbreviated jargon not actually Newspeak, but consisting largely of Newspeak words which was
            used in the Ministry for internal purposes. They ran:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth message aside. It was an intricate and
            responsible job and had better be dealt with last. The other three were routine matters, though the second
            one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston dialled 'back numbers' on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of <em>The Times,</em>
            which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes' delay. The messages he had received referred
            to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as the
            official phrase had it, to rectify. For example, it appeared from <em>The Times</em> of the seventeenth of
            March that Big Brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the South Indian front would
            remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in North Africa. As it happened, the
            Eurasian Higher Command had launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone. It was
            therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother's speech, in such a way as to make him predict the
            thing that had actually happened. Or again, <em>The Times</em> of the nineteenth of December had published
            the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983,
            which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three&minus;Year Plan. Today's issue contained a statement of
            the actual output, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong. Winston's
            job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones. As for the third message,
            it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short a time ago as
            February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a 'categorical pledge' were the official words) that
            there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston was aware, the
            chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week. All that
            was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to
            reduce the ration at some time in April.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the
            appropriate copy of <em>The Times</em> and pushed them into the pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which
            was as nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had
            made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did
            know in general terms. As soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular
            number of <em>The Times</em> had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the original
            copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead. This process of continuous alteration was
            applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound&minus;tracks,
            cartoons, photographs to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any
            political or ideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to
            date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been
            correct, nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the
            moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed
            exactly as often as was necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, to prove
            that any falsification had taken place. The largest section of the Records Department, far larger than the
            one on which Winston worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all
            copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction.
            A number of the Times which might, because of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>uttered by Big Brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date, and no
            other copy existed to contradict it. Books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were
            invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made. Even the written instructions
            which Winston received, and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated
            or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors, misprints,
            or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But actually, he thought as he re&minus;adjusted the Ministry of Plenty's figures, it was not even forgery. It was
            merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing with
            had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct
            lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great deal of
            the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty's forecast
            had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was given as
            sixty&minus;two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty&minus;seven
            millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty&minus;two
            millions was no nearer the truth than fiftyseven millions, or than 145 millions. Very likely no boots had been
            produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew
            was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the
            population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small.
            Everything faded away into a shadow&minus;world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become
            uncertain</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston glanced across the hall. In the corresponding cubicle on the other side a small,
            precise&minus;looking, dark&minus; chinned man named Tillotson was working steadily away, with a folded
            newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the air of trying
            to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. He looked up, and his spectacles
            darted a hostile flash in Winston's direction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed on. People in the Records
            Department did not readily talk about their jobs. In the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles
            and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were quite a dozen
            people whom Winston did not even know by name, though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the
            corridors or gesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman
            with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply at tracking down and deleting from the Press the names of
            people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. There was a certain
            fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier. And a few cubicles away
            a mild, ineffectual, dreamy creature named Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for
            juggling with rhymes and metres, was engaged in producing garbled versions definitive texts, they were
            called of poems which had become ideologically offensive, but which for one reason or another were to be
            retained in the anthologies. And this hall, with its fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one sub&minus;section, a
            single cell, as it were, in the huge complexity of the Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were other
            swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. There were the huge printingshops with
            their sub&minus;editors, their typography experts, and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of
            photographs. There was the tele&minus;programmes section with its engineers, its producers, and its teams of actors
            specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. There were the armies of reference clerks whose job was
            simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall. There were the vast repositories
            where the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were
            destroyed. And somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who co&minus;ordinated the
            whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should
            be preserved, that one falsified, and the other rubbed out of existence.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">19</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the Records Department, after all, was itself only a single branch of the Ministry of Truth, whose
            primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of Oceania with newspapers, films,
            textbooks, telescreen programmes, plays, novels with every conceivable kind of information, instruction, or
            entertainment, from a statue to a slogan, from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from a child's
            spelling&minus;book to a Newspeak dictionary. And the Ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs
            of the party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat.
            There was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, music, drama, and
            entertainment generally. Here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport,
            crime and astrology, sensational five&minus;cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimental songs
            which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator.
            There was even a whole sub&minus;section <em>Pornosec</em> , it was called in Newspeak engaged in producing
            the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packets and which no Party member, other than
            those who worked on it, was permitted to look at.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while Winston was working, but they were simple matters,
            and he had disposed of them before the Two Minutes Hate interrupted him. When the Hate was over he returned
            to his cubicle, took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed the speakwrite to one side, cleaned his
            spectacles, and settled down to his main job of the morning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work. Most of it was a tedious routine, but included in it
            there were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a
            mathematical problem delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you except your knowledge
            of the principles of Ingsoc and your estimate of what the Party wanted you to say. Winston was good at this
            kind of thing. On occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of <em>The Times</em> leading
            articles, which were written entirely in Newspeak. He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier. It
            ran:</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be rendered: The reporting of Big Brother's Order for the Day in
            The Times of December 3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non&minus;existent
            persons. Rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before filing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston read through the offending article. Big Brother's Order for the Day, it seemed, had been chiefly
            devoted to praising the work of an organization known as FFCC, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts
            to the sailors in the Floating Fortresses. A certain Comrade Withers, a prominent member of the Inner Party,
            had been singled out for special mention and awarded a decoration, the Order of Conspicuous Merit, Second
            Class.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given. One could assume that Withers and
            his associates were now in disgrace, but there had been no report of the matter in the Press or on the
            telescreen. That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even
            publicly denounced. The great purges involving thousands of people, with public trials of traitors and
            thought&minus;criminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed, were
            special show&minus;pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years. More commonly, people who
            had incurred the displeasure of the Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never had
            the smallest clue as to what had happened to them. In some cases they might not even be dead. Perhaps thirty people
            personally known to Winston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper&minus;clip. In the cubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson was
            still crouching secretively over his speakwrite. He raised his head for a moment: again the hostile
            spectacle&minus;flash.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">20</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself. It was perfectly possible.
            So tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person: on the other hand, to turn it over to
            a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place. Very likely as many as a
            dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said. And presently
            some master brain in the Inner Party would select this version or that, would re&minus;edit it and set in
            motion the complex processes of cross&minus;referencing that would be required, and then the chosen lie
            would pass into the permanent records and become truth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced. Perhaps Big Brother was merely getting rid of a too&minus;popular subordinate.
            Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps&minus;what was likeliest of all&minus;the
            thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of
            government. The only real clue lay in the words 'refs unpersons', which indicated that Withers was already
            dead. You could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested. Sometimes they were
            released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed. Very
            occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some
            public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing, this time for
            ever. Withers, however, was already an unperson. He did not exist: he had never existed. Winston decided
            that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of Big Brother's speech. It was better to make
            it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>            
        <p>He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thought&minus;criminals, but that was a
            little too obvious, while to invent a victory at the front, or some triumph of over&minus;production in the
            Ninth Three&minus;Year Plan, might complicate the records too much. What was needed was a piece of pure
            fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready made as it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy,
            who had recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances. There were occasions when Big Brother devoted his
            Order for the Day to commemorating some humble, rankand&minus;file Party member whose life and death he held
            up as an example worthy to be followed. Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. It was true that there was no
            such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring
            him into existence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in Big Brother's
            familiar style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then
            promptly answering them ('What lessons do we learn from this fact, comrades? The lesson&minus;which is also
            one of the fundamental principles of Ingsoc&minus;that,' etc., etc.), easy to imitate.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">21</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit: in the end he
            decided against it because of the unnecessary cross&minus;referencing that it would entail.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. Something seemed to tell him with certainty that
            Tillotson was busy on the same job as himself. There was no way of knowing whose job would finally be
            adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade Ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago,
            was now a fact. It struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones. Comrade Ogilvy,
            who had never existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was
            forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius
            Caesar.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the low&minus;ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the lunch queue jerked slowly forward. The room was
            already very full and deafeningly noisy. From the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring
            forth, with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. On the far side of
            the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought at ten cents the large
            nip.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Just the&nbsp; man&nbsp; I&nbsp; was&nbsp; looking&nbsp; for,'&nbsp; said&nbsp; a&nbsp; voice&nbsp; at&nbsp;
            Winston's back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked in the Research Department. Perhaps 'friend' was not
            exactly the right word. You did not have friends nowadays, you had comrades: but there were some comrades
            whose society was pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist, a specialist in Newspeak. Indeed,
            he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak
            Dictionary. He was a tiny creature, smaller than Winston, with dark hair and large, protuberant eyes, at
            once mournful and derisive, which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I wanted to ask you whether you'd got any razor&nbsp; blades,'&nbsp; he&nbsp; said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Not one!' said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. 'I've&nbsp; tried&nbsp; all over the place. They don't
            exist any longer.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually he had two unused ones which he was hoarding up. There
            had been a famine of them for months past. At any given moment there was some necessary article which the
            Party shops were unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darning wool, sometimes it was
            shoelaces; at present it was razor blades. You could only get hold of them, if at all, by scrounging more or
            less furtively on the 'free' market.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I've been using the same blade for six weeks,' he added untruthfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted he turned and faced Syme again. Each of them took a
            greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?' said Syme.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I was working,' said Winston indifferently. 'I shall see it on the flicks, I suppose.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'A very inadequate substitute,' said Syme.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His mocking eyes roved over Winston's face. 'I know you,' the eyes seemed to say, 'I see through you. I know
            very well why you didn't go to see those prisoners hanged.' In an intellectual way, Syme was venomously
            orthodox. He would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy villages, and
            trials and confessions of thought&minus;criminals, the executions in the cellars of the Ministry of Love.
            Talking to</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">22</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him, if possible, in the
            technicalities of Newspeak, on which he was authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his head a little
            aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It was a good hanging,' said Syme reminiscently. 'I think it spoils it when they tie their feet together. I
            like to see them kicking. And above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue a quite bright
            blue. That's the detail that appeals to me.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Nex', please!' yelled the white&minus;aproned prole with the ladle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. On to each was dumped
            swiftly the regulation lunch a metal pannikin of pinkish&minus;grey stew, a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory
            Coffee, and one saccharine tablet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'There's a table over there, under that telescreen,'&nbsp; said&nbsp; Syme.&nbsp; 'Let's pick up a gin on the
            way.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. They threaded their way across the crowded room and
            unpacked their trays on to the metal topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew,
            a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston took up his mug of gin, paused for an instant
            to collect his nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the tears out of his eyes
            he suddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew, which, in among its
            general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. Neither of
            them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. From the table at Winston's left, a little behind
            his back, someone was talking rapidly and continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck,
            which pierced the general uproar of the room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'How is the Dictionary getting on?' said Winston, raising his voice to overcome the noise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Slowly,' said Syme. 'I'm on the adjectives. It's fascinating.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak. He pushed his pannikin aside, took up his hunk
            of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to
            speak without shouting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,' he said. 'We're getting the language into its final shape the
            shape it's going to have when nobody speaks anything else. When we've finished with it, people like you will
            have to learn it all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job is inventing new words. But not a bit
            of it! We're destroying words scores of them, hundreds of them, every day. We're cutting the language
            down to the bone. The Eleventh Edition won't contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year
            2050.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, then continued speaking, with a sort of
            pedant's passion. His thin dark face had become animated, his eyes had lost their mocking expression and
            grown almost dreamy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and
            adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms;
            there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite
            of some other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take "good", for instance. If you have a word
            like "good", what need is there for a word like "bad"? "Ungood" will do just as well better, because it's an
            exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of "good", what sense is
            there in having a whole string</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">23</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of vague useless words like "excellent" and "splendid" and all the rest of them? "Plusgood" covers the
            meaning, or " doubleplusgood" if you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already.
            but in the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else. In the end the whole notion of goodness and
            badness will be covered by only six words in reality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that,
            Winston? It was B.B.'s idea originally, of course,' he added as an afterthought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston's face at the mention of Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme
            immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,' he said almost sadly. 'Even when you write it you're
            still thinking in Oldspeak. I've read some of those pieces that you write in <em>The Times</em>
            occasionally. They're good enough, but they're translations. In your heart you'd prefer to stick to
            Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning. You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. Do you know that
            Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not trusting himself to speak. Syme
            bit off another fragment of the dark&minus;coloured bread, chewed it briefly, and went on:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make
            thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that
            can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly <em>one</em> word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all
            its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we're not far from that
            point. But the process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer
            words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller. Even now, of course, there's no reason or
            excuse for committing thoughtcrime. It's merely a question of self&minus;discipline, reality&minus;control.
            But in the end there won't be any need even for that. The Revolution will be complete when the language is
            perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak,' he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. 'Has it
            ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be
            alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Except' began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It had been on the tip of his tongue to say 'Except the proles,' but he checked himself, not feeling fully
            certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox. Syme, however, had divined what he was about to
            say.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The proles are not human beings,' he said carelessly. ' By 2050 earlier, probably all real knowledge of
            Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer,
            Shakespeare, Milton, Byron they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed into something
            different, but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be. Even the literature of
            the Party will change. Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like "freedom is slavery" when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The whole climate of thought will be different. In fact there
            will <em>be</em> no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking not needing to think.
            Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme will be vaporized. He is too
            intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly. The Party does not like such people. One day he
            will disappear. It is written in his face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of
            coffee. At the table on his left the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. A
            young woman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back to Winston, was listening to
            him and</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">24</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said. From time to time Winston caught some such remark
            as 'I think you're <em>so</em> right, I do <em>so</em> agree with you', uttered in a youthful and rather
            silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an instant, even when the girl was speaking.
            Winston knew the man by sight, though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the
            Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a
            little, and because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the light and presented to
            Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What was slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that
            poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just once Winston caught a
            phrase&minus;'complete and final elimination of Goldsteinism'&minus; jerked out very rapidly and, as it
            seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a
            quackquack&minus;quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you could
            not be in any doubt about its general nature. He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner
            measures against thought&minus; criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the atrocities of
            the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar front&minus;it made no
            difference. Whatever it was, you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc. As
            he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of
            dummy. It was not the man's brain that was speaking, it was his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him
            consisted of words, but it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like
            the quacking of a duck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of
            stew. The voice from the other table quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'There is a word in Newspeak,' said Syme, 'I don't know whether you know it: <em>duckspeak,</em> to quack
            like a duck. It is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings. Applied to an
            opponent, it is abuse, applied to someone you agree with, it is praise.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again. He thought it with a kind of sadness, although
            well knowing that Syme despised him and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a
            thought&minus;criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something subtly wrong with Syme. There
            was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he
            was unorthodox. He believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother, he rejoiced over
            victories, he hated heretics, not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up&minus;to&minus;dateness
            of information, which the ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet a faint air of disreputability always
            clung to him. He said things that would have been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented
            the Chestnut Tree Cafe/, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law, not even an unwritten law,
            against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe/, yet the place was somehow ill&minus;omened. The old, discredited
            leaders of the Party had been used to gather there before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself, it was
            said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. Syme's fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet
            it was a fact that if Syme grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston's, secret opinions, he
            would betray him instantly to the Thought police. So would anybody else, for that matter: but Syme more
            than most. Zeal was not enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Syme looked up. 'Here comes Parsons,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, 'that bloody fool'. Parsons, Winston's fellow&minus;tenant
            at Victory Mansions, was in fact threading his way across the room a tubby, middle&minus;sized man with fair
            hair and a froglike face. At thirty&minus;five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline,
            but his movements were brisk and boyish. His whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much
            so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to think of him as
            being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red neckerchief of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw
            always a</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">25</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did, indeed, invariably revert
            to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He greeted
            them both with a cheery 'Hullo, hullo!' and sat down at the table, giving off an intense smell of sweat.
            Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face. His powers of sweating were extraordinary. At the
            Community Centre you could always tell when he had been playing table&minus;tennis by the dampness of the
            bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words, and was studying
            it with an ink&minus;pencil between his fingers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Look at him working away in the lunch hour,' said Parsons, nudging Winston. 'Keenness, eh? What's that
            you've got there, old boy? Something a bit too brainy for me, I expect. Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why
            I'm chasing you. It's that sub you forgot to give me.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Which sub is that? said Winston, automatically feeling for money. About a quarter of one's salary had to be
            earmarked for voluntary subscriptions, which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'For Hate Week. You know the house&minus;by&minus;house fund. I'm treasurer for our block. We're making an
            all&minus;out effort going to put on a tremendous show. I tell you, it won't be my fault if old Victory
            Mansions doesn't have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which Parsons entered in a small notebook, in the
            neat handwriting of the illiterate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'By the way, old boy,' he said. 'I hear that little beggar of mine let fly at you with his catapult
            yesterday. I gave him a good dressingdown for it. In fact I told him I'd take the catapult away if he does
            it again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ah, well what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn't it? Mischievous little beggars they are,
                both of them, but talk about keenness! All they think about is the Spies, and the war, of course. D'you
                know what that little girl of mine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike out Berkhamsted way?
                She got two other girls to go with her, slipped off from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon
                following a strange man. They kept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, when
                they got into Amersham, handed him over to the patrols.'
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What did they do that for?' said Winston, somewhat taken aback. Parsons went on triumphantly:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent might have been dropped by parachute, for instance. But
            here's the point, old boy. What do you think put her on to him in the first place? She spotted he was
            wearing a funny kind of shoes said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before. So the chances
            were he was a foreigner. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What happened to the man?' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ah, that I couldn't say, of course. But I wouldn't be altogether surprised if&minus;' Parsons made the
            motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue for the explosion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Good,' said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Of course we can't afford to take chances,' agreed Winston dutifully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What I mean to say, there is a war on,' said Parsons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">26</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads.
            However, it was not the proclamation of a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the
            Ministry of Plenty.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Comrades!' cried an eager youthful voice. 'Attention, comrades! We have glorious news for you. We have won
            the battle for production! Returns now completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show
            that the standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past year. All over Oceania this
            morning there were irrepressible spontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and
            offices and paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to Big Brother for the new,
            happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us. Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs-</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The phrase 'our new, happy life' recurred several times. It had been a favourite of late with the Ministry of
            Plenty. Parsons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity, a
            sort of edified boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they were in some way a
            cause for satisfaction. He had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred
            tobacco. With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top.
            Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start
            till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter
            noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen. It appeared that there had even
            been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And
            only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grammes a
            week. Was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty&minus;four hours? Yes, they swallowed
            it. Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature at the other table
            swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone
            who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too in some more complex way,
            involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, alone in the possession of a memory?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. As compared with last year there was more
            food, more clothes, more houses, more furniture, more cooking&minus;pots, more fuel, more ships, more
            helicopters, more books, more babies&minus;more of everything except disease, crime, and insanity. Year by
            year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards. As Syme had done earlier
            Winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in the pale&minus;coloured gravy that dribbled across the
            table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of
            life. Had it always been like this? Had food always tasted like this? He looked round the canteen. A low
            ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and
            chairs, placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays, coarse white
            mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee
            and metallic stew and dirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest, a
            feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to. It was true that he had no memories
            of anything greatly different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never been quite
            enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes, furniture had always
            been battered and rickety, rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces, bread dark&minus;coloured,
            tea a rarity, coffee filthy&minus;tasting, cigarettes insufficient&minus;always
            very nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. And though,
            of course, it grew worse as one's body aged, was it not a sign that this was not the natural order of things, if
            one's heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness of one's
            socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food
            with its strange evil tastes? Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral
            memory that things had once been different?</p>
        <p>He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed
            otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls. On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small,
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">27</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>curiously beetle&minus;like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting suspicious glances from
            side to side. How easy it was, thought Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical
            type set up by the Party as an ideal&minus;tall muscular youths and deep&minus;bosomed maidens,
            blond&minus;haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree existed and even predominated. Actually, so far as he could
            judge, the majority of people in Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill&minus;favoured. It was curious how that beetle&minus;like type
            proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growing stout very early in life, with short legs, swift
            scuttling movements, and fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to flourish
            best under the dominion of the Party.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music. Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The Ministry of Plenty's certainly done a good job this year,' he said with a knowing shake of his head. 'By
            the way, Smith old boy, I suppose you haven't got any razor blades you can let me have?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Not one,' said Winston. 'I've been using the same blade for six weeks myself.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ah, well just thought I'd ask you, old boy.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Sorry,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the Ministry's announcement, had started
            up again, as loud as ever. For some reason Winston suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her
            wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. Within two years those children would be denouncing her
            to the Thought Police. Mrs Parsons would be vaporized. Syme would be vaporized. Winston would be
            vaporized. O'Brien would be vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized. The eyeless
            creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized. The little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly
            through the labyrinthine corridors of Ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. And the girl with dark
            hair, the girl from the Fiction Department she would never be vaporized either. It seemed to him that he
            knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish: though just what it was that made for survival,
            it was not easy to say
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. The girl at the next table had turned
            partly round and was looking at him. It was the girl with dark hair. She was looking at him in a sidelong way,
            but with curious intensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked away again. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sweat started out on Winston's backbone. A horrible pang of terror went through him. It was gone almost
            at once, but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind. Why was she watching him? Why did she keep
            following him about? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when
            he arrived, or had come there afterwards. But yesterday, at any rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she had
            sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real object had been
            to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member of the Thought Police, but then
            it was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all. He did not know how long she had been
            looking at him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was possible that his features had not been
            perfectly under control. It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public
            place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious
            look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality,
            of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous
            when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">28</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Newspeak: <em>facecrime,</em> it was called.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after all she was not really following him about, perhaps
            it was coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running. His cigarette had gone out, and he
            laid it carefully on the edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work, if he could keep the
            tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely
            he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette end must not be
            wasted. Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket. Parsons had begun talking
            again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Did I ever tell you, old boy,' he said, chuckling round the stem of his pipe, 'about the time when those two
            nippers of mine set fire to the old market&minus;woman's skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in
            a poster of B.B.? Sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches. Burned her quite badly, I
            believe. Little beggars, eh? But keen as mustard! That's a first&minus;rate training they give them in the
            Spies nowadays better than in my day, even. What d'you think's the latest thing they've served them out
            with? Ear trumpets for listening through keyholes ! My little girl brought one home the other night tried it
            out on our sitting&minus;room door, and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole.
            Of course it's only a toy, mind you. Still, gives 'em the right idea, eh?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. It was the signal to return to work. All three men
            sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts, and the remaining tobacco fell out of
            Winston's cigarette.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston was writing in his diary:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a narrow side&minus;street near one of the big
                railway stations. She was standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any
                light. She had a young face, painted very thick. It was really the paint that appealed to me, the
                whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. Party women never paint their faces. There was
                nobody else in the street, and no telescreens. She said two dollars. I</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying
            to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring. He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of
            filthy words at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall, to kick over the table, and hurl
            the inkpot through the window to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory
            that was tormenting him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. At any moment the tension inside you was liable
            to translate itself into some visible symptom. He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few
            weeks back; a quite ordinary&minus;looking man, a Party member, aged thirty&minus;five to forty, tallish and
            thin, carrying a brief&minus;case. They were a few metres apart when the left side of the man's face was
            suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. It happened again just as they were passing one another: it was only
            a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual. He remembered
            thinking at the time: That poor devil is done for. And what was frightening was that the action was quite
            possibly unconscious. The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. There was no way of guarding
            against that, so far as he could see.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He drew his breath and went on writing:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit. Simultaneously with the woman in the basement

            still was married, so far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour
            of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but
            nevertheless alluring, because no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so. Only

        <p>permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to
            one another. The only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the Party.
            Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema. This
            again was never put into plain words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from
            childhood onwards. There were even organizations such as the Junior Anti&minus;Sex League, which advocated
            complete celibacy for both sexes. All children were to be begotten by artificial insemination
            <em>(artsem,</em> it was called in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. This, Winston was aware,
            was not meant</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party. The Party was trying
            to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty it. He did not know
            why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so. And as far as the women were concerned, the
            Party's efforts were largely successful.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten nearly eleven years since they had parted. It was curious
            how seldom he thought of her. For days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married.
            They had only been together for about fifteen months. The Party did not permit divorce, but it rather
            encouraged separation in cases where there were no children.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Katharine was a tall, fair&minus;haired girl, very straight, with splendid movements. She had a bold,
            aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as
            possible nothing behind it. Very early in her married life he had decided though perhaps it was only that he
            knew her more intimately than he knew most people that she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar,
            empty mind that he had ever encountered. She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there
            was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party handed it out to her.
            'The human sound&minus;track' he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he could have endured living with her if
            it had not been for just one thing sex.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden
            image. And what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she
            was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidlty of her muscles managed to convey
            that impression. She would lie there with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co&minus;operating but
            <em>submitting.</em> It was extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then he
            could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate. But curiously
            enough it was Katharine who refused this. They must, she said, produce a child if they could. So the
            performance continued to happen, once a week quite regulariy, whenever it was not impossible. She even used
            to remind him of it in the morning, as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be
            forgotten. She had two names for it. One was 'making a baby', and the other was 'our duty to the Party'
            (yes, she had actually used that phrase). Quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the
            appointed day came round. But luckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying, and
            soon afterwards they parted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston&nbsp; sighed&nbsp; inaudibly. He picked up his pen again and&nbsp; wrote:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse,
                horrible way you can imagine, pulled up her skirt. I</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He&nbsp; saw&nbsp; himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; smell of bugs and cheap
            scent in his nostrils,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought
            of Katharine's white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party. Why did it always have to be
            like this? Why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years?
            But</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event. The women of the Party were all alike. Chastity was as
            deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty. By careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the
            rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the Youth League, by lectures, parades,
            songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling had been driven out of them. His reason told him that
            there must be exceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable, as the Party intended
            that they should be. And what he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue,
            even if it were only once in his whole life. The sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion. Desire
            was thoughtcrime. Even to have awakened Katharine, if he could have achieved it, would have been like a
            seduction, although she was his wife.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But&nbsp; the&nbsp; rest of the story had got to be written down. He&nbsp; wrote:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>I turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright. For the first time he could
            see the woman properly. He had taken a step towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror. He was
            painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here. It was perfectly possible that the patrols
            would catch him</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>on the way out: for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment. If he went away
            without even doing what he had come here to do !</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed. What he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was
            that the woman was <em>old.</em> The paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it
            might crack like a cardboard mask. There were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly dreadful detail
            was that her mouth had fallen a little open, revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness. She had no
            teeth at all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years old at least. But I went ahead and
                did it just the same.</em></p>

        <p>He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. He had written it down at last, but it made no difference.
            The therapy had not worked. The urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever.

        <p><em>If there is hope,</em> wrote Winston, <em>it lies in&nbsp; the&nbsp; proles.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If there was hope, it <em>must</em> lie in the proles, because only there in those swarming disregarded
            masses, 85 per cent of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated.
            The Party could not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming
            together or even of identifying one another. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it
            might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes.
            Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word.
            But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength. would have no need to
            conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. If they chose
            they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it?
            And yet&minus;!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He remembered how once he had been walking down a&nbsp; crowded&nbsp; street&nbsp; when&nbsp; a&nbsp;
            tremendous shout of hundreds</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of voices women's&nbsp; voices&nbsp;&nbsp; had&nbsp; burst from a side&minus;street a little way&nbsp;
            ahead.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp; great&nbsp; formidable cry of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>anger and despair, a deep, loud&nbsp; 'Oh&minus;o&minus;o&minus;o&minus;oh!' that&nbsp; went humming on like
            the reverberation of a&nbsp; bell. His</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>heart had leapt.&nbsp; It's&nbsp; started!&nbsp; he&nbsp; had&nbsp; thought.&nbsp; A&nbsp; riot!&nbsp;
            The&nbsp; proles&nbsp; are&nbsp; breaking&nbsp; loose&nbsp; at&nbsp; last! When he had</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>reached the spot it was to see a mob of&nbsp; two&nbsp; or&nbsp; three&nbsp; hundred&nbsp; women&nbsp;
            crowding round the stalls of a street</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>market, with faces&nbsp; as tragic as though they had been the doomed&nbsp; passengers&nbsp; on&nbsp; a&nbsp;
            sinking ship. But at this</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>moment the general&nbsp; despair broke down&nbsp; into&nbsp; a&nbsp; multitude of individual quarrels.
            It&nbsp; appeared that one&nbsp; of the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>stalls&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; selling&nbsp; tin&nbsp; saucepans.&nbsp; They&nbsp; were&nbsp;
            wretched,&nbsp; flimsy&nbsp; things,&nbsp; but&nbsp; cooking&minus;pots&nbsp; of any kind&nbsp; were</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>always difficult to get. Now the supply had unexpectedly&nbsp; given&nbsp; out. The successful women, bumped
            and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>jostled by the rest, were&nbsp; trying&nbsp; to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others&nbsp;

        <p>children,&nbsp; petty quarrels with neighbours,&nbsp; films, football, beer, and&nbsp; above all, gambling,
            filled&nbsp; up&nbsp; the&nbsp; horizon</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult. A few agents of the Thought Police moved always
            among them, spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged
            capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party.
            It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of them
            was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer
            working&minus;hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their
            discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific
            grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles did not even have
            telescreens in their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them very little. There was a vast amount
            of criminality in London, a whole world&minus;within&minus;a&minus;world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes,
            drug&minus;peddlers, and racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles
            themselves, it was of no importance. In all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral
            code. The sexual puritanism of the Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce was
            permitted. For that matter, even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any
            sign of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>needing or wanting it.&nbsp; They&nbsp; were&nbsp; beneath&nbsp; suspicion.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the&nbsp;
            Party&nbsp; slogan put it:&nbsp; 'Proles and&nbsp; animals are free.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer. It had begun itching again. The thing you
            invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the Revolution had really been
            like. He took out of the drawer a copy of a children's history textbook which he had borrowed from Mrs
            Parsons, and began copying a passage into the diary:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>In the old days</em> (it ran), <em>before the glorious Revolution, London was not the beautiful city that
                we know today. It was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where
                hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under.
                Children no older</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too
                slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>But in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived
                in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them. These rich men were called
                capitalists. They were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite
                page. You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer,
                shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat. This was the uniform of the capitalists,
                and no one else was allowed to wear it.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>The capitalists owned everything in the world, and everyone else was their slave. They owned all the
                land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. If anyone disobeyed them they could throw
                them into prison,</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>or they could take his job away and starve him to death. When any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist
                he had to cringe and bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as 'Sir'. The chief of all the
                capitalists was called the King. and</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the
            judges in their ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the cat&minus;o'&minus;nine tails, the
            Lord Mayor's Banquet, and the practice of kissing the Pope's toe. There was also something called the
            <em>jus primae noctis,</em> which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children. It was the law
            by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories.</p>

            worn&minus;out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the Party was
            something huge, terrible, and glittering a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying
            weapons a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts
            and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting three hundred million
            people all with the same face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and
            fro in leaky shoes, in patched&minus;up nineteenth&minus;century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad
            lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up
            with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a

        <p>Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe/. He
            remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye.
            They were men far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great figures left over
            from the heroic days of the Party. The glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly
            clung to them. He had the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he
            had known their names years earlier than he had known that of Big Brother. But also they were outlaws,
            enemies, untouchables, doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. No one who had
            once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end. They were corpses waiting to be
            sent back to</p>

        <p>the grave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood
            of such people. They were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the
            speciality of the cafe/. Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance had most impressed Winston.
            Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion
            before and during the Revolution. Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in <em>The
                Times</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were simply an imitation of his earlier manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they
            were a rehashing of the ancient themes slum tenements, starving children, street battles, capitalists in top
            hats even on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless, hopeless
            effort to get back into the past. He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy grey hair, his face pouched
            and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At one time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was
            sagging, sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction. He seemed to be breaking up before one's eyes,
            like a mountain crumbling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could&nbsp; not&nbsp; now&nbsp; remember how he had come to be in
            the cafe/ at</p>

        <p>A little later all three were re&minus;arrested. It appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from
            the very moment of their release. At their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again,
            with a whole string of new ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded in the Party histories, a
            warning to posterity. About five years after this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which
            had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had
            evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw
            its significance. It was a half&minus;page torn out of <em>The Times</em> of about ten years earlier the top
            half of the page, so that it included the date and it contained a photograph of the delegates at some Party
            function in New York. Prominent in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There was
            no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on Eurasian
            soil. They had flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had
            conferred</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>with members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important military secrets. The date
            had stuck in Winston's memory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1984&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>record&nbsp; in countless other places as well. There&nbsp; was&nbsp; only one possible&nbsp; conclusion: the
            confessions were lies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that time Winston had not imagined that the people who
            were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this was
            concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong
            stratum and destroys a geological theory. It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could
            have been published to the world and its significance made known.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what the photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered
            it up with another sheet of paper. Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside&minus;down from the
            point of view of the telescreen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his&nbsp; chair&nbsp; so as to get as far away from
            the telescreen</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>as possible. To keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled,
            with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate
            enough to pick it up. He let what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the fear
            that some accident a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for instance would betray him. Then, without
            uncovering it again, he dropped the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers.
            Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was ten eleven years ago. Today, probably, he would have kept that photograph. It was curious that the
            fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph
            itself, as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party's hold upon the past less strong,
            he wondered, because a piece of evidence which existed no longer <em>had once</em> existed?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes, the photograph might not even be
            evidence. Already, at the time when he made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it
            must have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country. Since then
            there had been other changes two, three, he could not remember how many. Very likely the confessions had
            been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance. The
            past not only changed, but changed continuously. What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was
            that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken. The immediate advantages of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>falsifying&nbsp; the&nbsp; past were&nbsp; obvious, but the ultimate motive&nbsp; was mysterious. He took up
            his pen&nbsp; again and wrote:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>I understand</em> HOW: <em>I do not understand</em> WHY.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was
            simply a minority of one. At one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the sun; today, to believe that the past is inalterable. He might be <em>alone</em> in holding that belief,
            and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was
            that he might also be wrong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of Big Brother which formed its
            frontispiece. The hypnotic eyes gazed into his own. It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon
            you something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your brain, frightening you out of your
            beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce
            that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that
            claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but
            the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was
            common sense. And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they
            might be right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity</p>

        <p>works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and
            if the mind itself is controllable what then?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord. The face of O'Brien, not called up by any
            obvious association, had floated into his mind. He knew, with more certainty than before, that O'Brien was
            on his side. He was writing the diary for O'Brien <em>to</em> O'Brien: it was like an interminable letter
            which no one would ever read, but which was addressed to a particular person and took its colour from that
            fact.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.
            His heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party
            intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand,
            much less answer. And yet he was in the right! They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly, and
            the true had got to be defended. Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its laws do not
            change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall towards the earth's centre. With the feeling
            that he was speaking to O'Brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Freedom&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; freedom to say that two plus two make&nbsp; four.&nbsp; If that is
                granted, all else follows.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee real coffee, not Victory Coffee came
            floating out into the street. Winston paused involuntarily. For perhaps two seconds he was back in the
            half&minus;forgotten world of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly as
            though it had been a sound.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcer was throbbing. This was the second
            time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the Community Centre: a rash act, since you could be
            certain that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked. In principle a Party member

        <p>played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers. Perhaps a quarter of the windows
            in the street were broken and boarded up. Most of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>with a sort of guarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick&minus;red forearms folded across thelr
            aprons were talking outside a doorway. Winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>37</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Yes," I says to 'er, "that's all very well," I says. "But if you'd of been in my place you'd of done
                the same as what I done. It's easy to criticize," I says, "but you ain't got the same problems as what I
                got." '</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ah,' said the other, 'that's jest it. That's&nbsp; jest&nbsp; where&nbsp; it is.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The strident voices stopped abruptly. The women studied him in hostile silence as he went past. But it was
            not hostility, exactly; merely a kind of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some
            unfamiliar animal. The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a street like this. Indeed,
            it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless you had definite business there. The patrols might stop you
            if you happened to run into them. 'May I see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here? What time did
            you leave work? Is this your usual way home?' and so on and so forth. Not that there was any rule against
            walking home by an unusual route: but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Police heard
            about it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were yells of warning from all sides. People were shooting
            into the doorways like rabbits. A young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a
            tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back again, all in one movement. At
            the same instant a man in a concertina&minus;like black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards
            Winston, pointing excitedly to the sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Steamer!' he yelled. 'Look out, guv'nor!&nbsp; Bang&nbsp; over'ead!&nbsp; Lay&nbsp; down quick!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Steamer' was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung
            himself on his face. The proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. They
            seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming,
            although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head.
            There was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered on to his back.
            When he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up the street. A black plume of smoke hung
            in the sky, and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins.
            There was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in the middle of it he could see
            a bright red streak. When he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from
            the bloody stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned down a side&minus;street to the
            right. Within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid
            swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly twenty hours, and
            the drinking&minus;shops which the proles frequented ('pubs', they called them) were choked with customers.
            From their grimy swing doors, endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust,
            and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting house&minus; front three men were standing very close
            together, the middle one of them holding a folded&minus;up newspaper which the other two were studying over
            his shoulder. Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces, Winston could see
            absorption in every line of their bodies. It was obviously some serious piece of news that they were
            reading. He was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in
            violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you no number ending in seven ain't won for over
            fourteen months!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, it 'as, then!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1984&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            38</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No, it 'as not! Back 'ome I got the 'ole lot of 'em for over two years wrote down on a piece of paper. I
            takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock. An' I tell you, no number ending in seven&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, a seven <em>'as</em> won! I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number. Four oh seven, it ended in.
            It were in February second week in February.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'February your grandmother! I got it all down in black and&nbsp; white.&nbsp; An' I tell you, no
            number&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Oh, pack it in!' said the third man.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They&nbsp; were&nbsp; talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back&nbsp; when he&nbsp; had gone thirty
            metres. They were still</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>arguing,&nbsp; with&nbsp; vivid,&nbsp; passionate&nbsp; faces. The Lottery, with its weekly
            pay&minus;out&nbsp; of enormous&nbsp; prizes, was the&nbsp; one</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>public&nbsp; event&nbsp; to&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; proles&nbsp; paid&nbsp; serious attention. It was
            probable that there were&nbsp; some millions of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>proles for whom the Lottery was the&nbsp; principal&nbsp; if&nbsp; not&nbsp; the&nbsp; only&nbsp;
            reason&nbsp; for&nbsp; remaining&nbsp; alive. It was their&nbsp; delight,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>their&nbsp; folly,&nbsp; their&nbsp; anodyne,&nbsp; their&nbsp; intellectual&nbsp; stimulant.&nbsp;
            Where&nbsp; the&nbsp; Lottery&nbsp; was concerned, even people who</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>could&nbsp; barely&nbsp; read&nbsp; and&nbsp; write&nbsp; seemed&nbsp; capable&nbsp; of&nbsp; intricate&nbsp;
            calculations&nbsp; and staggering feats of&nbsp; memory. There</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was a whole&nbsp; tribe of men who made&nbsp; a&nbsp; living&nbsp; simply&nbsp; by&nbsp; selling&nbsp;
            systems,&nbsp; forecasts,&nbsp; and&nbsp; lucky&nbsp; amulets.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston had&nbsp; nothing to do with&nbsp; the running of the Lottery, which was managed by&nbsp; the&nbsp;
            Ministry&nbsp; of&nbsp; Plenty,&nbsp; but</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>he was aware (indeed everyone in the&nbsp; party was&nbsp; aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary.
            Only small</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>sums&nbsp; were&nbsp; actually&nbsp; paid&nbsp; out,&nbsp; the winners of the big prizes being&nbsp;
            non&minus;existent&nbsp; persons.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of&nbsp; any</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>real&nbsp; intercommunication&nbsp; between&nbsp; one&nbsp; part&nbsp; of Oceania and another,&nbsp;
            this&nbsp; was not difficult to arrange.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that. When you put it in words it sounded
            reasonable: it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of
            faith. The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling that he had been in this
            neighbourhood before, and that there was a main thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a
            din of shouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into
            a sunken alley where a few stallkeepers were selling tired&minus;looking vegetables. At this moment Winston
            remembered where he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down the next turning, not five minutes
            away, was the junk&minus;shop where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary. And in a small
            stationer's shop not far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He paused for a moment at the top of&nbsp; the&nbsp; steps.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the&nbsp; opposite&nbsp;
            side&nbsp; of the alley there was a dingy little pub</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>whose&nbsp; windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were&nbsp; merely&nbsp; coated&nbsp;
            with&nbsp; dust. A very old man, bent</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>but active, with white&nbsp; moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn,&nbsp; pushed&nbsp;
            open&nbsp; the swing door</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and went in. As Winston stood watching, it&nbsp; occurred to&nbsp; him that the old man, who must&nbsp;
            be&nbsp; eighty&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; least,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>had&nbsp; already&nbsp; been&nbsp; middle&minus;&nbsp; aged&nbsp; when&nbsp; the Revolution&nbsp; happened.
            He and a&nbsp; few others like him were the last</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>links that&nbsp; now existed with the&nbsp; vanished world of capitalism. In the Party&nbsp; itself there
            were not many&nbsp; people</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>left&nbsp; whose&nbsp; ideas&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; formed&nbsp; before&nbsp; the Revolution.&nbsp; The
            older generation had mostly&nbsp; been wiped out in</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the great purges of&nbsp; the fifties and&nbsp; sixties,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; few&nbsp; who&nbsp;
            survived&nbsp; had&nbsp; long ago&nbsp; been terrified into&nbsp; complete</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>intellectual surrender. If there&nbsp; was&nbsp; any&nbsp; one&nbsp; still&nbsp; alive&nbsp; who&nbsp;
            could&nbsp; give you a truthful account of&nbsp; conditions in</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the early part of the&nbsp; century,&nbsp; it&nbsp; could&nbsp; only&nbsp; be&nbsp; a&nbsp; prole.&nbsp;
            Suddenly&nbsp; the&nbsp; passage from the history book that he had</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>copied&nbsp; into his diary came back into Winston's&nbsp; mind,&nbsp; and&nbsp; a&nbsp; lunatic&nbsp;
            impulse&nbsp; took&nbsp; hold&nbsp; of him. He would go</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>into the pub, he would&nbsp; scrape acquaintance with that old&nbsp; man&nbsp; and&nbsp; question&nbsp;
            him.&nbsp; He&nbsp; would&nbsp; say to him: 'Tell</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>me about your life when you were a boy.&nbsp; What&nbsp; was&nbsp; it&nbsp; like in those days? Were things
            better than they&nbsp; are</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>now, or were&nbsp; they worse?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended the steps and crossed the narrow
            street. It was madness of course. As usual, there was no definite rule against talking to proles and
            frequenting their pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the patrols appeared he
            might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not likely that they would believe him. He pushed open the

        <p>'I arst you civil enough, didn't I?' said the old man, straightening his shoulders pugnaciously. 'You telling
            me you ain't got a pint mug in the 'ole bleeding boozer?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'And what in hell's name is a pint?' said the barman, leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the
            counter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ark at 'im ! Calls 'isself a barman and don't know what a pint is! Why, a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and
            there's four quarts to the gallon. 'Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Never heard of 'em,' said the barman shortly. 'Litre and half litre that's all we serve. There's the glasses
            on the shelf in front of you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I likes a pint,' persisted the old man. 'You could 'a drawed me off a pint easy enough. We didn't 'ave these
            bleeding litres when I was a young man.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,' said the barman, with a glance at the other
            customers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston's entry seemed to disappear. The old
            man's whitestubbled face had flushed pink. He turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston.
            Winston caught him gently by the arm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'May I offer you a drink?' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You're a gent,' said the other, straightening his shoulders again. He appeared not to have noticed Winston's
            blue overalls. 'Pint!' he added aggressively to the barman. 'Pint of wallop.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The barman swished two half&minus;litres of dark&minus;brown beer into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a
            bucket under the counter. Beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs. The proles were supposed not
            to drink gin, though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of darts was in full
            swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets. Winston's presence was
            forgotten for a moment. There was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without
            fear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a
            point he had made sure of as soon as he came in.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"E could 'a drawed me off a pint,' grumbled the old man as he settled down behind a glass. 'A 'alf litre
            ain't enough. It don't satisfy. And a 'ole litre's too much. It starts my bladder running. Let alone the
            price.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You&nbsp; must&nbsp; have seen great changes since you were a young&nbsp; man,'&nbsp; said Winston
            tentatively.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and from the bar to the door of the
            Gents, as though it were in the bar&minus;room that he expected the changes to have occurred.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The beer was better,' he said finally. 'And cheaper! When I was a young man, mild beer wallop we used to
            call it was fourpence a pint. That was before the war, of course.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Which war was that?' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's all wars,' said the old man vaguely. He took up his glass, and his shoulders straightened again. "Ere's
            wishing you the very best of 'ealth!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In his lean throat the sharp&minus;pointed Adam's apple&nbsp; made&nbsp; a&nbsp; surprisingly rapid
            up&minus;and&minus;down movement, and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the beer vanished. Winston went to the bar and came back with two more half&minus;litres. The old man
            appeared to have forgotten his prejudice against drinking a full litre.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are very much older than I am,' said Winston. 'You must have been a grown man before I was born. You can
            remember what it was like in the old days, before the Revolution. People of my age don't really know
            anything about those times. We can only read about them in books, and what it says in the books may not be
            true. I should like your opinion on that. The history books say that life before the Revolution was
            completely different from what it is now. There was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty worse
            than anything</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>we can imagine. Here in London, the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death.
            Half of them hadn't even boots on their feet. They worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they
            slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were a very few people, only a few thousands the
            capitalists, they were called who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was to own. They
            lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they rode about in motor&minus;cars and
            four&minus;horse carriages, they drank champagne, they wore top hats&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old man brightened suddenly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Top 'ats!' he said. 'Funny you should mention 'em. The same thing come into my 'ead only yesterday, I dono
            why. I was jest thinking, I ain't seen a top 'at in years. Gorn right out, they 'ave. The last time I wore
            one was at my sister&minus;in&minus;law's funeral. And that was well, I couldn't give you the date, but it
            must'a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only 'ired for the occasion, you understand.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It isn't very important about the top hats,' said Winston patiently. 'The point is, these capitalists they
            and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them were the lords of the earth. Everything existed
            for their benefit. You the ordinary people, the workers were their slaves. They could do what they liked
            with you. They could ship you off to Canada like cattle. They could sleep with your daughters if they chose.
            They could order you to be flogged with something called a cat&minus;o'&minus;nine tails. You had to take
            your cap off when you passed them. Every capitalist went about with a gang of lackeys who&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old man brightened again.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What I really wanted to know was this,' he said. 'Do you feel that you have more freedom now than you had in
            those days? Are you treated more like a human being? In the old days, the rich people, the people at the
            top&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The 'Ouse of Lords,' put in the old man reminiscently.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The House of Lords, if you like. What I am asking is, were these people able to treat you as an inferior,
            simply because they were rich and you were poor? Is it a fact, for instance, that you had to call them "Sir"
            and take off your cap when you passed them?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off about a&nbsp; quarter&nbsp; of his beer before answering.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes,' he said. 'They liked you to touch your cap to 'em. It showed respect, like. I didn't agree with it,
            myself, but I done it often enough. Had to, as you might say.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'And was it usual I'm only quoting what I've read in history books was it usual for these people and their
            servants to push you off the pavement into the gutter?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'One of 'em pushed me once,' said the old man. 'I recollect it as if it was yesterday. It was Boat Race night
            terribly rowdy they used to get on Boat Race night and I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue.
            Quite a gent, 'e was dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat. 'E was kind of zig&minus;zagging across the
            pavement, and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I bumps into 'im accidental&minus;like. 'E says, "Why can't you look where you're going?" 'e says. I say, "Ju
            think you've bought the bleeding pavement?" 'E says, "I'll twist your bloody 'ead off if you get fresh with
            me." I</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>says, "You're drunk. I'll give you in charge in 'alf a minute," I says. An' if you'll believe me, 'e puts 'is
            'and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the wheels of a bus. Well, I was young in
            them days, and I was going to 'ave fetched 'im one, only&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old man's memory was nothing but a rubbish&minus;heap of
            details. One could question him all day without getting any real information. The party histories might
            still be true, after a fashion: they might even be completely true. He made a last attempt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Perhaps I have not made myself clear,' he said. 'What I'm trying to say is this. You have been alive a very
            long time; you lived half your life before the Revolution. In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up.
            Would you say from what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better than it is now, or worse? If you
            could choose, would you prefer to live then or now?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He finished up his beer, more slowly than before. When he
            spoke it was with a tolerant philosophical air, as though the beer had mellowed him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I know what you expect me to say,' he said. 'You expect me to say as I'd sooner be young again. Most
            people'd say they'd sooner be young, if you arst' 'em. You got your 'ealth and strength when you're young.
            When you get to my time of life you ain't never well. I suffer something wicked from my feet, and my
            bladder's jest terrible. Six and seven times a night it 'as me out of bed. On the other 'and, there's great
            advantages in being a old man. You ain't got the same worries. No truck with women, and that's a great
            thing. I ain't 'ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you'd credit it. Nor wanted to, what's more.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston sat back against the window&minus;sill. It was no use going on. He was about to buy some more beer
            when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The
            extra half&minus;litre was already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty
            glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again. Within twenty years at the
            most, he reflected, the huge and simple question, 'Was life better before the Revolution than it is now?'
            would have ceased once and</p>

        <p>1984&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            42</p>

        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for all to be answerable. But in effect it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from
            the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They remembered a million useless
            things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long&minus;dead
            sister's face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant facts were
            outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones.
            And when memory failed and written records were falsified when that happened, the claim of the Party to have
            improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again
            could exist, any standard against which it could be tested.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He halted and looked up. He was in a narrow street,
            with a few dark little shops, interspersed among dwelling&minus;houses. Immediately above his head there
            hung three discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. He seemed to know the
            place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk&minus;shop where he had bought the diary.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>twinge of fear went through him. It had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning,
                and he had sworn never to come near the place again. And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to
                wander, his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. It was precisely against suicidal
                impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary. At the same time he
                noticed that although it was nearly twenty&minus;one hours the shop was still open. With the feeling
                that he would be less conspicuous inside</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>than hanging about on the pavement, he stepped through the doorway. If questioned, he could plausibly say
            that he was trying to buy razor blades.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an unclean but friendly smell. He was a man
            of perhaps sixty, frail and bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick
            spectacles. His hair was almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy and still black. His spectacles, his
            gentle, fussy movements, and the fact that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague
            air of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary man, or perhaps a musician. His voice
            was soft, as though faded, and his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I recognized you on the pavement,' he said immediately. 'You're the gentleman that bought the young lady's
            keepsake album. That was a beautiful bit of paper, that was. Cream&minus; laid, it used to be called.
            There's been no paper like that made for oh, I dare say fifty years.' He peered at Winston over the top of
            his spectacles. 'Is there anything special I can do for you? Or did you just want to look round?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I&nbsp; was passing,' said Winston vaguely. 'I just looked in.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp; want anything in
            particular.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's just as well,' said the other, 'because I don't suppose I could have satisfied you.' He made an
            apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand. 'You see how it is; an empty shop, you might say. Between you
            and me, the antique trade's just about finished. No demand any longer, and no stock either. Furniture,
            china, glass it's all been broken up by degrees. And of course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down. I
            haven't seen a brass candlestick in years.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but there was almost nothing in it of the
            slightest value. The floorspace was very restricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable
            dusty picture&minus;frames. In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn&minus;out chisels,
            penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order, and other
            miscellaneous rubbish. Only on a small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends lacquered
            snuffboxes, agate</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>brooches, and&nbsp; the like&nbsp;&nbsp; which looked as though&nbsp; they might include something&nbsp;
            interesting. As Winston</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>wandered towards&nbsp; the table his eye&nbsp; was&nbsp; caught&nbsp; by&nbsp; a&nbsp; round,&nbsp;
            smooth&nbsp; thing that&nbsp; gleamed softly in the&nbsp; lamplight,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and he picked it up.</p>

        <p>1984&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            43</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making almost a hemisphere. There was a
            peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in both the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it,
            magnified by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea
            anemone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What is it?' said Winston, fascinated.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'That's coral, that is,' said the old man. 'It must have come from the Indian Ocean. They used to kind of
            embed it in the glass. That wasn't made less than a hundred years ago. More, by the look of it.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's a beautiful thing,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It is a beautiful thing,' said the other&nbsp; appreciatively.&nbsp; 'But&nbsp; there's&nbsp; not&nbsp;
            many&nbsp; that'd&nbsp; say so nowadays.' He</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>coughed.&nbsp; 'Now, if it&nbsp; so happened that you wanted to buy it, that'd&nbsp; cost&nbsp; you&nbsp;
            four&nbsp; dollars. I can remember when</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>a thing like that would&nbsp; have fetched&nbsp; eight pounds, and eight&nbsp; pounds&nbsp;
            was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well,&nbsp; I&nbsp; can't&nbsp; work&nbsp; it&nbsp; out,&nbsp; but it was</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>a lot of money. But who cares&nbsp; about genuine antiques&nbsp; nowadays even the few that's left?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing into his pocket. What appealed to
            him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite
            different from the present one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen. The
            thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once
            have been intended as a paperweight. It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much
            of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising thing, for a Party member to have in his possession.
            Anything old, and for that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The old man had grown
            noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. Winston realized that he would have accepted

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'There's another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,' he said. 'There's not much in it. Just
            a few pieces. We'll do with a light if we're going upstairs.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny
            passage, into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of
            chimney&minus;pots. Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to
            be lived in. There was a strip of carpet on the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly
            arm&minus;chair drawn up to the fireplace. An old&minus;fashioned glass clock with a twelve&minus;hour face
            was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying nearly a quarter of the room, was an
            enormous bed with the mattress still on it.</p>

        <p>He was holdlng the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and in the warm dim light the place
            looked curiously inviting. The thought flitted through Winston's mind that it would probably be quite easy
            to rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It was a wild, impossible notion,
            to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of
            ancestral memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an
            arm&minus;chair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone,
            utterly secure, with nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing of the kettle
            and the friendly ticking of the clock.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'There's no telescreen!' he could not help murmuring.</p>

        <p>'Ah,' said the old man, 'I never had one of those things. Too expensive. And I never seemed to feel the need
            of it, somehow. Now that's a nice gateleg table in the corner there. Though of course you'd have to put new
            hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp; small&nbsp; bookcase&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; other corner, and&nbsp;
            Winston&nbsp; had already gravitated towards it. It contained</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>nothing&nbsp; but rubbish.&nbsp; The hunting&minus;down and destruction of books had been&nbsp; done with
            the&nbsp; same&nbsp; thoroughness</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>in&nbsp; the&nbsp; prole&nbsp; quarters&nbsp; as&nbsp; everywhere&nbsp; else.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was&nbsp;
            very&nbsp; unlikely&nbsp; that&nbsp; there existed&nbsp; anywhere in Oceania a copy</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of a&nbsp; book printed earlier than 1960.&nbsp; The old man, still carrying the lamp,&nbsp; was standing in
            front&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; picture&nbsp; in</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>a rosewood frame which hung&nbsp; on the other side of&nbsp; the fireplace, opposite the bed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at&nbsp; all&nbsp; &minus;' he&nbsp; began delicately.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular
            windows, and a small tower in front. There was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end
            there was what appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It seemed vaguely familiar,
            though he did not remember the statue.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The frame's fixed to the wall,' said the old man, 'but&nbsp; I&nbsp; could&nbsp; unscrew it for you, I dare
            say.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I know that building,' said Winston finally. 'It's a ruin now. It's in the middle of the street outside the
            Palace of Justice.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'That's right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in oh, many years ago. It was a church at one time, St
            Clement Danes, its name was.' He smiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly
            ridiculous, and added: 'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!'</p>

        <p>"there, now, that's as far as I can get. A farthing, thatwas a small copper coin, looked something like a
            cent.' 'Where was St Martin's?' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'St Martin's ? That's still standing. It's in Victory Square, alongside the picture gallery. A building with
            a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front, and a big flight of steps.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used for propaganda displays of various kinds scale models of
            rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses, waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'St Martin's&minus;in&minus;the&minus;Fields it used to be called,' supplemented the old man, 'though I don't
            recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; buy&nbsp; the picture. It would have been an&nbsp; even&nbsp; more
            incongruous possession than&nbsp; the&nbsp; glass</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>gathered from the&nbsp; inscription over the shop&minus; front&nbsp;&nbsp; but&nbsp; Charrington.&nbsp;
            Mr&nbsp; Charrington,&nbsp; it&nbsp; seemed,&nbsp; was a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>widower aged&nbsp; sixty&minus;three and had&nbsp; inhabited&nbsp; this&nbsp; shop&nbsp; for&nbsp;
            thirty&nbsp; years.&nbsp; Throughout&nbsp; that&nbsp; time&nbsp; he&nbsp; had been</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>intending to alter the name&nbsp; over the window, but had never&nbsp; quite got to the point of&nbsp;
            doing&nbsp; it.&nbsp; All&nbsp; the&nbsp; while</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that they were&nbsp; talking the half&minus;remembered&nbsp; rhyme kept running through Winston's head.&nbsp;
            Oranges&nbsp; and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>lemons&nbsp; say&nbsp; the bells of St Clement's, You owe me three&nbsp; farthings, say&nbsp; the bells of St
            Martin's ! It was curious,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>but when you&nbsp; said it&nbsp; to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells,&nbsp; the&nbsp;
            bells of a lost London that</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>still existed somewhere&nbsp; or&nbsp; other,&nbsp; disguised and forgotten. From one ghostly steeple after
            another&nbsp; he&nbsp; seemed</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>to&nbsp; hear them pealing forth. Yet so far as he could&nbsp; remember&nbsp; he had never in real life heard
            church bells</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>ringing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as not to let the old man see him
            reconnoitring the street before stepping out of the door. He had already made up his mind that after a
            suitable interval a month, say he would take the risk of visiting the shop again. It was perhaps not more
            dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre. The serious piece of folly had been to come back here in
            the first place, after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be
            trusted. However&minus;!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish. He would buy the
            engraving of St Clement Danes, take it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his
            overalls. He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington's memory. Even the lunatic project of
            renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again. For perhaps five seconds exaltation
            made him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the
            window. He had even started humming to an improvised tune</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You owe me three farthings, say the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water. A figure in blue overalls was coming down
            the pavement, not ten metres away. It was the girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The
            light was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She looked him straight in the face, then
        </p>

        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>walked quickly on as though she had&nbsp; not seen him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move. Then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not
            noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction. At any rate, one question was settled.
            There was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She must have followed him here, because
            it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the
            same obscure backstreet, kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived. It was too great a
            coincidence. Whether she was really an agent of the Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by
            officiousness, hardly mattered. It was enough that she was watching him. Probably she had seen him go into
            the pub as well.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step, and he was
            half minded to take it out and throw it away. The worst thing was the pain in his belly. For a couple of
            minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon. But there would be no
            public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then
            turned round and began to retrace his steps. As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed
            him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her. He could keep on her track
            till they were in some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone. The piece of glass in
            his pocket would be heavy enough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately, because even the
            thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. He could not run, he could not strike a blow. Besides,
            she was young and lusty and would defend herself. He thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and
            staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening. But that too was
            impossible. A deadly lassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit
            down and be quiet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was after twenty&minus;two hours when he got back to the flat. The lights would be switched off at the
            main at twenty&minus;three thirty. He went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin.
            Then he went to the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. But he did not open
            it at once. From</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring at the marbled cover of
            the book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It&nbsp; was&nbsp; at night that they came for you, always at night.&nbsp; The&nbsp; proper thing was to
            kill&nbsp; yourself&nbsp; before&nbsp; they&nbsp; got</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>you.&nbsp; Undoubtedly some people did so. Many of the disappearances were&nbsp; actually&nbsp;
            suicides.&nbsp; But&nbsp; it&nbsp; needed</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>desperate courage to kill&nbsp; yourself in a world where firearms, or any&nbsp; quick&nbsp; and&nbsp;
            certain&nbsp; poison, were</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>completely unprocurable. He thought with a kind of&nbsp; astonishment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; biological
            uselessness of pain and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>fear,&nbsp; the&nbsp; treachery of the&nbsp; human&nbsp; body&nbsp; which&nbsp; always&nbsp; freezes&nbsp;
            into&nbsp; inertia&nbsp; at exactly the moment when a special</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>effort is needed.&nbsp; He might have&nbsp; silenced the dark&minus;haired&nbsp; girl&nbsp; if&nbsp;
            only&nbsp; he&nbsp; had&nbsp; acted quickly&nbsp; enough: but</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>precisely because of the extremity of&nbsp; his&nbsp; danger he had&nbsp; lost the power to act. It struck
            him that in&nbsp; moments of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>crisis one is&nbsp; never&nbsp; fighting&nbsp; against&nbsp; an&nbsp; external&nbsp; enemy, but always
            against one's&nbsp; own body. Even now, in spite</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of&nbsp; the&nbsp; gin,&nbsp; the&nbsp; dull ache in his belly&nbsp; made consecutive thought&nbsp;
            impossible. And it is the same, he perceived,&nbsp; in</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>all&nbsp; seemingly&nbsp; heroic or tragic situations. On the battlefield, in&nbsp; the torture&nbsp;
            chamber,&nbsp; on&nbsp; a&nbsp; sinking ship, the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>issues that you are&nbsp; fighting&nbsp; for are always forgotten, because the body swells up&nbsp;
            until&nbsp; it&nbsp; fills&nbsp; the&nbsp; universe,&nbsp; and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>even&nbsp; when you are not paralysed by&nbsp; fright or screaming&nbsp; with&nbsp; pain,&nbsp; life&nbsp;
            is&nbsp; a&nbsp; moment&minus;to&minus;moment&nbsp; struggle</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>against&nbsp; hunger&nbsp; or&nbsp; cold or sleeplessness, against a&nbsp; sour&nbsp; stomach or an aching
            tooth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He opened the diary. It was important to write something down. The woman on the telescreen had started a new
            song. Her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass. He tried to think of O'Brien,
            for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen
            to him after the Thought Police took him away. It would not matter if they killed you at once. To be killed
        </p>

        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was what you expected. But before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet everybody knew of them) there was
            the routine of confession that had to be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy,
            the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth, and bloody clots of hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Why did you have to endure it, since the&nbsp; end&nbsp; was&nbsp; always&nbsp; the&nbsp; same?&nbsp;
            Why&nbsp; was it not possible to cut a few days</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you
            had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead. Why then did that
            horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded in future time?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of O'Brien. 'We shall meet in the
            place where there is no darkness,' O'Brien had said to him. He knew what it meant, or thought he knew. The
            place where there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see, but which, by
            foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. But with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he
            could not follow the train of thought further. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco promptly
            fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again. The face of Big Brother swam
            into his mind, displacing that of O'Brien. Just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of his
            pocket and looked at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm, protecting: but what kind of smile was
            hidden beneath the dark moustache? Like a leaden knell the words came back at him:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>WAR IS PEACE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>* Chapter Two *</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left the&nbsp; cubicle&nbsp; to go to the lavatory.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long, brightly&minus;lit corridor. It
                was the girl with dark hair. Four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside
                the junk&minus;shop. As she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable at a
                distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls. Probably she had crushed her hand while
                swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were 'roughed in'. It was a
                common accident in the Fiction Department.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled&nbsp; and&nbsp; fell almost flat on her face. A
            sharp cry of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>pain was wrung out of her. She must have fallen right on the injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had
            risen to her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out redder than
            ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart. In front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in
                front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. Already he had
                instinctively started forward to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm,
                it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You're hurt?' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's nothing. My arm. It'll be all right in a second.'</p>

        <p>small and flat. As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the
            tips of his fingers. It was a scrap of paper folded into a square.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more fingering, to get it unfolded. Obviously there
            must be a message of some kind written on it. For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the
            water&minus;closets and read it at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew. There was no
            place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the
            desk, put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towards him. 'five minutes,' he told himself, 'five
            minutes at the very least!' His heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness. Fortunately the piece
            of work he was engaged on was mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing close
            attention.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some&nbsp; kind&nbsp; of&nbsp; political&nbsp; meaning.&nbsp;
            So&nbsp; far as he could see there</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>were two&nbsp; possibilities. One, much the more likely, was that the girl was&nbsp; an&nbsp; agent of the
            Thought Police, just</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>as he had feared.&nbsp; He&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; know&nbsp; why the Thought Police should choose to
            deliver their&nbsp; messages in such&nbsp; a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>fashion, but perhaps they had their reasons.&nbsp; The thing that was&nbsp; written on the paper might
            be&nbsp; a&nbsp; threat,&nbsp; a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>summons,&nbsp; an&nbsp; order&nbsp; to&nbsp; commit&nbsp; suicide,&nbsp; a&nbsp; trap&nbsp; of&nbsp;
            some&nbsp; description. But there was&nbsp; another,&nbsp; wilder&nbsp; possibility</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that&nbsp; kept&nbsp; raising&nbsp; its head, though&nbsp; he tried vainly to suppress it.&nbsp; This was,
            that the message did not&nbsp; come from</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the Thought Police&nbsp; at all, but from some kind of underground&nbsp; organization. Perhaps&nbsp; the
            Brotherhood existed</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>after all! Perhaps the&nbsp; girl was part of&nbsp; it! No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had&nbsp;
            sprung&nbsp; into&nbsp; his&nbsp; mind&nbsp; in&nbsp; the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in&nbsp; his&nbsp; hand. It was not till a couple of minutes later
            that the other,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>more probable explanation had occurred to him.&nbsp; And&nbsp; even&nbsp; now,&nbsp; though&nbsp; his&nbsp;
            intellect told him that the message</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>probably meant&nbsp; death&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still,&nbsp; that&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; what&nbsp;
            he&nbsp; believed,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; unreasonable&nbsp; hope&nbsp; persisted, and his</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>heart banged, and it was&nbsp; with difficulty&nbsp; that he kept his voice&nbsp; from&nbsp; trembling&nbsp;
            as&nbsp; he&nbsp; murmured his figures&nbsp; into</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the speakwrite.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He
            re&minus; adjusted his spectacles on his nose, sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the
            scrap of paper on top of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a large unformed handwriting:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>I love you.</em></p>
        <p><em><br /> </em></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing into the memory hole. When he
            did so, although he knew very well the danger of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it
            once again, just to make sure that the words were really there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. What was even worse than having to focus his mind
            on a series of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. He felt as though a
            fire were burning in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise&minus; filled canteen was torment. He had
            hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile
            Parsons flopped down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up
            a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week. He was particularly enthusiastic about a
            papier&minus; ma^che/ model of Big Brother's head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by
            his daughter's troop of Spies. The irritating thing was that in the racket of voices Winston could hardly
            hear what Parsons was saying, and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just
            once he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room. She
            appeared not to have seen him, and he did not look in that direction again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after lunch there arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work
            which would take several hours and necessitated putting everything else aside. It consisted in falsifying a
            series of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of
            the Inner Party, who was now under a cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and for
            more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether. Then the memory of her
            face came back, and with it a raging, intolerable desire to be alone. Until he could be alone it was
            impossible to think this new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at the Community Centre. He
            wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurried off to the Centre, took part in the solemn foolery of
            a 'discussion group', played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and sat for half
            an hour through a lecture entitled 'Ingsoc in relation to chess'. His soul writhed with boredom, but for
            once he had had no impulse to shirk his evening at the Centre. At the sight of the words <em>I love you</em>
            the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was
            not till twenty&minus;three hours, when he was home and in bed in the darkness, where you were safe even
            from the telescreen so long as you kept silent that he was able to think continuously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting. He
            did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. He knew that
            it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note. Obviously she had been
            frightened out of her wits, as well she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his
            mind. Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone, but that was of no
            importance. He thought of her naked, youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined her a
            fool like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her belly full of ice. A kind of
            fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him!
            What he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch
            with her quickly. But the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous. It was like trying to make a move at
            chess when you were already mated. Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you. Actually, all the
            possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading the note; but
            now, with time to think, he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row of instruments on a table.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not be repeated. If she had worked in
            the Records Department it might have been comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts
            in the building the Fiction Departrnent lay, and he had no pretext for going there. If he had known where
            she lived, and at what time she left work, he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home;
            but to try to follow her home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about outside the Ministry,
            which was bound to be noticed. As for sending a letter through the mails, it was out of the question.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By a routine that was not even secret, all letters were opened in transit. Actually, few people ever wrote
            letters. For the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send, there were printed postcards with long
            lists of phrases, and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he did not know the girl's
            name, let alone her address. Finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen. If he could get her
            at a table by herself, somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and with a
            sufficient buzz of conversation all round if these conditions endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be
            possible to exchange a few words.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On the next day she did not appear in the canteen
            until he was leaving it, the whistle having already blown. Presumably she had been changed on to a later
            shift. They passed each other without a glance. On the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual
            time, but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen. Then for three dreadful days she did
            not appear at all. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort of
            transparency, which made every movement, every sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or
            listen to, an agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image. He did not touch the diary
            during those days. If there was any relief, it was in his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself
            for ten minutes at a stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. There was no enquiry
            he could make. She might have been vaporized, she might have committed suicide, she might have been
            transferred to the other end of Oceania: worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mind
            and decided to avoid him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of sticking&minus;plaster round
            her wrist. The relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for
            several seconds. On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When he came into the
            canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place
            was not very full. The queue edged forward till Winston was almost at the counter, then was held up for two
            minutes because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of saccharine. But the
            girl was still alone when Winston secured his tray and began to make for her table. He walked casually
            towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her. She was perhaps three metres away from
            him. Another</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>two seconds would do it. Then a voice behind him called, 'Smith!' He pretended not to hear. 'Smith !' repeate
            the voice, more loudly. It was no use. He turned round. A blond&minus;headed, silly&minus;faced young man
            named Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not
            safe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl. It
            was too noticeable. He sat down with a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had a
            hallucination of himself smashing a pick&minus;axe right into the middle of it. The girl's table filled up a
            few minutes later.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps she would take the hint. Next day he took care to
            arrive early. Surely enough, she was at a table in about the same place, and again alone. The person
            immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly&minus;moving, beetle&minus;like man with a flat
            face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away from the counter with his tray, he saw that the
            little man was making straight for the girl's table. His hopes sank again. There was a vacant place at a
            table further away, but something in the little man's appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently
            attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table. With ice at his heart Winston followed. It was no
            use unless he could get the girl alone. At this moment there was a tremendous crash. The little man was
            sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying, two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the
            floor. He started to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, whom he evidently suspected of having
            tripped him up. But it was all right. Five seconds later, with a thundering heart, Winston was sitting at
            the girl's table.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating. It was all&minus;important to speak
            at once, before anyone else came, but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him. A week had gone by
            since she had first approached him. She would have changed her mind, she must have changed her mind! It</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>wandering&nbsp; limply&nbsp; round the room with a tray, looking for a place to&nbsp; sit down. In&nbsp;
            his&nbsp; vague&nbsp; way&nbsp; Ampleforth</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was attached to Winston, and&nbsp; would&nbsp; certainly sit down at his table if&nbsp; he&nbsp; caught&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>perhaps&nbsp; a minute in which to act. Both Winston and&nbsp; the&nbsp; girl were eating steadily. The stuff
            they were eating</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was a&nbsp; thin stew,&nbsp; actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a&nbsp; low&nbsp; murmur&nbsp;
            Winston&nbsp; began&nbsp; speaking.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; of them</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>looked up; steadily&nbsp; they spooned the&nbsp; watery stuff into their&nbsp; mouths,&nbsp; and&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Where can we meet?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Victory Square, near the monument.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No. Don't come up to me until you see me among a lot of people. And don't look at me. Just keep somewhere
            near me.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What time?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Nineteen hours.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'All right.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ampleforth&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to see Winston and sat down at another&nbsp; table.&nbsp; They did not speak
            again, and, so far as it</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was possible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one another.
            The girl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while Winston stayed to smoke a cigarette.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time. He wandered round the base of the enormous fluted
            column, at the top of which Big Brother's statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished
            the Eurasian aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a few years ago) in the Battle of Airstrip
            One. In the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent
            Oliver Cromwell. At five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared. Again the terrible fear
            seized upon Winston. She was not coming, she had changed her mind! He walked slowly up to the north side of
            the square and got a sort of pale&minus;coloured pleasure from identifying St Martin's Church, whose bells,
            when it had bells, had chimed 'You owe me three farthings.' Then he saw the girl standing at the base of the
            monument, reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column. It was not safe to go
            near her until some more people had accumulated. There were telescreens all round the pediment. But at this
            moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. Suddenly
            everyone seemed to be running across the square. The girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the
            monument and joined in the rush. Winston followed. As he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that a
            convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square. Winston, at normal times the kind
            of person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way
            forward into the heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm's length of the girl, but the way was blocked by
            an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an
            impenetrable wall of flesh. Winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managed to drive his
            shoulder between them. For a moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two
            muscular hips, then he had broken through, sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were shoulder to
            shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A long line of trucks, with wooden&minus;faced guards armed with&nbsp; sub&minus;machine guns standing
            upright in each</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>corner, was passing slowly down the street. In the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were
            squatting, jammed close together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks utterly
            incurious. Occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clankclank of metal: all the prisoners were wearing
            leg&minus;irons. Truckload after truck&minus;load of the sad faces passed. Winston knew they were there but
            he saw them only intermittently. The girl's shoulder, and her arm right down to the elbow, were pressed
            against his. Her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. She had immediately taken charge
            of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. She began speaking in the same expressionless voice
            as before, with lips barely moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of
            the trucks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Can you hear me?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Can you get Sunday afternoon off?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Then listen carefully. You'll have to remember&nbsp; this.&nbsp; Go&nbsp; to&nbsp; Paddington
            Station&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With a sort of military precision that astonished him, she&nbsp; outlined&nbsp; the&nbsp; route that he was
            to follow. A</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>half&minus;hour railway journey; turn left outside the station; two kilometres along the road: a gate with
            the top bar missing; a path across a field; a grass&minus;grown lane; a track between bushes; a dead tree
            with moss on it. It was as though she had a map inside her head. 'Can you remember all that?' she murmured
            finally.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You turn left, then&nbsp; right,&nbsp; then&nbsp; left&nbsp; again.&nbsp; And&nbsp; the&nbsp; gate's&nbsp;
            got no top bar.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes. What time?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'About&nbsp; fifteen.&nbsp; You&nbsp; may have to wait. I'll get there by&nbsp; another&nbsp; way. Are you
            sure you remember everything?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Then get away from me as quick as you can.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She need not have told him that. But for the moment they could not extricate themselves from the crowd. The
            trucks were still filing post, the people still insatiably gaping. At the start there had been a few boos
            and hisses, but it came only from the Party members among the crowd, and had soon stopped. The prevailing
            emotion was simply curiosity. Foreigners, whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind of strange
            animal. One literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as prisoners one never got

        <p>more than a momentary glimpse of them. Nor did one know what became of them, apart from the few who were
            hanged as war&minus;criminals: te others simply vanished, presumably into forced&minus;labour camps. The
            round Mogol faces had given way to faces of a more European type, dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over
            scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into Winston's, sometimes with strange intensity, and flashed away again. The
            convoy was drawing to an end. In the last truck he could see an aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair,
            standing upright with wrists crossed in front of him, as though he were used to having them bound together.
            It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part. But at the last moment, while the crowd still hemmed
            them in, her hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting squeeze.</p>

        <p>Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade, stepping out into pools of gold wherever
            the boughs parted. Under the trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells. The air seemed to
            kiss one's skin. It was the second of May. From somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the droning
            of ring doves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was a bit early. There had been no&nbsp; difficulties&nbsp; about&nbsp; the&nbsp; journey, and the girl
            was so evidently experienced</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that he was less frightened than he would normally have been. Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe
            place. In general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in London. There were
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>no telescreens, of course, but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might
            be picked up and recognized; besides, it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting
            attention. For distances of less than 100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed, but
            sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations, who examined the papers of any Party member
            they found there and asked awkward questions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the
            station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not being followed. The train was full of
            proles, in holiday mood because of the summery weather. The wooden&minus; seated carriage in which he
            travelled was filled to overflowing by a single enormous family. ranging from a toothless
            great&minus;grandmother to a month&minus;old baby, going out to spend an afternoon with 'in&minus;laws' in
            the country, and, as they freely explained to Winston, to get hold of a little blackmarket butter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him of, a mere cattle&minus;track
            which plunged between the bushes. He had no watch, but it could not be fifteen yet. The bluebells were so
            thick underfoot that it was impossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and began picking some partly to
            pass the time away, but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the
            girl when they met. He had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound
            at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was the
            best thing to do. It might be the girl, or he might have been followed after all. To look round was to show
            guilt. He picked another and another. A hand fell lightly on his shoulder.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evidently as a warning that he must keep silent, then
            parted the bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow track into the wood. Obviously she had been that
            way before, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston followed, still clasping his bunch of

        <p>flowers. His first feeling was relief, but as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him, with
            the scarlet sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips, the sense of his own
            inferiority was heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round and looked at him
            she would draw back after all. The sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted him. Already
            on the walk from the station the May sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors,
            with the sooty dust of London in the pores of his skin. It occurred to him that till now she had probably
            never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of. The girl
            hopped over and forced apart the bushes, in which there did not seem to be an opening. When Winston followed
            her, he found that they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings that
            shut it in completely. The girl stopped and turned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Here we are,' she said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was facing her at several paces' distance.&nbsp; As&nbsp; yet&nbsp; he&nbsp; did not&nbsp; dare move
            nearer to her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I didn't want to say anything in the lane,' she went on, 'in case there's a mike hidden there. I don't
            suppose there is, but there could be. There's always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your
            voice. We're all right here.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He&nbsp; still&nbsp; had not the courage to approach her. 'We're all&nbsp; right&nbsp; here?' he repeated
            stupidly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes. Look at the trees.' They were small ashes, which at some time had been cut down and had sprouted up
            again into a forest of poles, none of them thicker than one's wrist. 'There's nothing big enough to hide a
            mike in. Besides, I've been here before.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were only making conversation. He had managed to move closer to her now. She stood before him very
            upright, with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical, as though she were wondering why he was so
            slow to act. The bluebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed to have fallen of their own accord. He
            took her hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Would you believe,' he said, 'that till this moment I didn't know what colour your eyes were?' They were
            brown, he noted, a rather light shade of brown, with dark lashes. 'Now that you've seen what I'm really
            like, can you still bear to look at me?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, easily.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I'm thirty&minus;nine years old. I've got a wife that I can't get rid of. I've got varicose veins. I've got
            five false teeth.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I couldn't care less,' said the girl.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was in his his arms. At the beginning he had no feeling
            except sheer incredulity. The youthful body was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against
            his face, and yes ! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red mouth. She had
            clasped her arms about his neck, she was calling him darling, precious one, loved one. He had pulled her
            down on to the ground, she was utterly unresisting, he could do what he liked with her. But the truth was
            that he had no physical sensation, except that of mere contact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He
            was glad that this was happening, but he had no physical desire. It was too soon, her youth and prettiness
            had frightened him, he was too much used to living without women he did not know the reason. The girl picked
            herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her hair. She sat against him, putting her arm round his waist.</p>

        <p>'Never mind, dear. There's no hurry. We've got the whole afternoon. Isn't this a splendid hide&minus;out? I
            found it when I got lost once on a community hike. If anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres
            away.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What is your name?' said Winston.</p>

        <p>'Julia. I know yours. It's Winston&nbsp;&nbsp; Winston Smith.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'How did you find that out?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I expect I'm better at finding things out than you are, dear. Tell me, what did you think of me before that
            day I gave you the note?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. It was even a sort of love&minus;offering to start off by
            telling the worst.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I hated the sight of you,' he said. 'I wanted to rape you and then murder you afterwards. Two weeks ago I
            thought seriously of smashing your head in with a cobblestone. If you really want to know, I imagined that
            you had something to do with the Thought Police.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The&nbsp; girl&nbsp; laughed delightedly, evidently taking this as a&nbsp; tribute&nbsp; to the excellence of
            her disguise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Not the Thought Police! You didn't honestly think that?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Well, perhaps not exactly that. But from your general appearance merely because you're young and fresh and
            healthy, you understand I thought that probably&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You thought I was a good Party member. Pure in word and deed. Banners, processions, slogans, games,
            community hikes all that stuff. And you thought that if I had a quarter of a chance I'd denounce you as a
            thought&minus;criminal and get you killed off?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, something of that kind. A great many young girls are&nbsp; like&nbsp; that, you know.'</p>

        <p>The first fragment of chocolate had meIted on Winston's tongue. The taste was delightful. But there was still
            that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to
            definite shape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye. He pushed it away from him, aware only
            that it was the memory of some action which he would have liked to undo but could not.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are very young,' he said. 'You are ten or fifteen years younger than I am. What could you see to attract
            you in a man like me?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It was something in your face. I thought I'd take a chance. I'm good at spotting people who don't belong. As
            soon as I saw you I knew you were against <em>them.'</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Them,</em> it appeared, meant the Party, and above all the Inner Party, about whom she talked with an
            open jeering hatred which made Winston feel uneasy, although he knew that they were safe here if they could
            be safe anywhere. A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language. Party members
            were supposed not to swear, and Winston himself very seldom did swear, aloud, at any rate. Julia, however,
            seemed unable to mention the Party, and especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of words that you
            saw chalked up in dripping alley&minus;ways. He did not dislike it. It was merely one symptom of her revolt
            against the Party and all its ways, and somehow it seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse
            that smells bad hay. They had left the clearing and were wandering again through the chequered shade, with
            their arms round each other's waists whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast. He noticed how much
            softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. They did not speak above a whisper. Outside the
            clearing, Julia said, it was better to go quietly. Presently they had reached the edge of the little wood.
            She stopped him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Don't&nbsp; go&nbsp; out&nbsp; into&nbsp; the&nbsp; open.&nbsp; There&nbsp; might be someone&nbsp; watching.
            We're all right if we keep behind the boughs.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. The sunlight, filtering through innumerable leaves, was
            still hot on their faces. Winston looked out into the field beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock of
            recognition. He knew it by sight. An old, closebitten pasture, with a footpath wandering across it and a
            molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just
            perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like women's hair. Surely
            somewhere nearby, but out of sight, there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Isn't there a stream somewhere near here?' he whispered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'That's right, there is a stream. It's at the edge of the next field, actually. There are fish in it, great
            big ones. You can watch them lying in the pools under the willow trees, waving their tails.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's the Golden Country&nbsp;&nbsp; almost,' he murmured.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The Golden Country?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's&nbsp; nothing, really. A landscape I've seen sometimes in&nbsp; a&nbsp; dream.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Look!' whispered Julia.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away, almost at the level of their faces. Perhaps it had not
            seen them. It was in the sun, they in the shade. It spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place
            again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun, and then began to pour
            forth a torrent of song. In the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung
            together, fascinated. The music went on and on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations, never once
            repeating itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it
            stopped for a few</p>

        <p>seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song.
            Winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate, no
            rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness?
            He wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken only in
            low whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the
            other end of the instrument some small, beetle&minus;like man was listening intently listening to
            <em>that.</em> But by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as though it
            were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight that filtered
            through the leaves. He stopped thinking and merely felt. The girl's waist in the bend of his arm was soft
            and warm. He pulled her round so</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that they were breast to breast; her body seemed to melt into his. Wherever his hands moved it was all as
            yielding as water. Their mouths clung together; it was quite different from the hard kisses they had
            exchanged earlier. When they moved their faces apart again both of them sighed deeply. The bird took fright
            and fled with a clatter of wings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston&nbsp; put&nbsp; his&nbsp; lips&nbsp; against her ear. <em>'Now,'</em> he&nbsp; whispered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Not here,' she whispered back. 'Come back&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; hide&minus;&nbsp; out.&nbsp; It's safer.'
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Quickly, with an occasional crackle of twigs, they threaded their way back to the clearing. When they were
            once inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him. They were both breathing fast. but the smile had
            reappeared round the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him for an instant, then felt at the zipper
            of her overalls. And, yes! it was almost as in his dream. Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had
            torn her clothes off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a
            whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. Her body gleamed white in the sun. But for a moment he did not
            look at her body; his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint, bold smile. He knelt down
            before her and took her hands in his</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Have you done this before?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Of&nbsp; course.&nbsp; Hundreds&nbsp; of&nbsp; times&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well scores of times&nbsp; anyway</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'With Party members.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, always with Party members.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'With members of the Inner Party?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Not with those swine, no. But there's plenty that <em>would</em> if they got half a chance. They're not so
            holy as they make out.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he wished it had been hundreds thousands. Anything that
            hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the
            surface, its cult of strenuousness and selfdenial simply a sham concealing iniquity. If he could have
            infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Anything to rot,
            to weaken, to undermine! He pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Listen.&nbsp; The more men you've had, the more I love you. Do&nbsp; you&nbsp; understand that?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, perfectly.'</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don't want any virtue to exist anywhere. I want everyone to be corrupt to
            the bones.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Well&nbsp; then, I ought to suit you, dear. I'm corrupt to the&nbsp; bones.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You like doing this? I don't mean simply me: I&nbsp; mean&nbsp; the&nbsp; thing&nbsp; in itself?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I adore it.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct, the
            simple undifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tear the Party to pieces. He pressed her down
            upon the grass, among the fallen bluebells. This time there was no difficulty. Presently the rising and
            falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. The
            sun seemed to have grown hotter. They were both sleepy. He reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled
            them partly over her. Almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston woke first. He sat up and watched the freckled face, still peacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of
            her hand. Except for her mouth, you could not call her beautiful. There was a line or two round the eyes, if
            you looked closely. The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft. It occurred to him that he still
            did not know her surname or where she lived.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in him a pitying, protecting feeling. But the mindless
            tenderness that he had felt under the hazel tree, while the thrush was singing, had not quite come back. He
            pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank. In the old days, he thought, a man looked at a
            girl's body and saw that it was desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could not have pure
            love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their
            embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political
            act.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We can come here once again,' said Julia. 'It's generally safe to use any hide&minus;out twice. But not for
            another month or two, of course.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. She became alert and business&minus;like, put her clothes
            on, knotted the scarlet sash about her waist, and began arranging the details of the journey home. It seemed
            natural to leave this to her. She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston lacked, and she seemed
            also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round London, stored away from innumerable community
            hikes. The route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come, and brought him out at
            a different railway station. 'Never go home the same way as you went out,' she said, as though enunciating
            an important general principle. She would leave first, and Winston was to wait half an hour before following
            her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had named a place where they could meet after work, four evenings hence. It was a street in one of the
            poorer quarters, where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy. She would be hanging
            about among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing&minus; thread. If she judged that
            the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk past her without
            recognition. But with luck, in the middle of the crowd, it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour
            and arrange another meeting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'And now I must go,' she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions. 'I'm due back at
            nineteen&minus;thirty. I've got to put in two hours for the Junior Anti&minus;Sex League, handing out
            leaflets, or something. Isn't it</p>

            good&minus;bye, my love, good&minus;bye!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost violently, and a moment later pushed her way through the
            saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little noise. Even now he had not found out her surname or
            her address. However, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable that they could ever meet indoors or
            exchange any kind of written communication.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As it happened, they never went back to the clearing in the wood. During the month of May there was only one
            further occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love. That was in another hidlng&minus;place
            known to Julia, the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost&minus;deserted stretch of country where an
            atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. It was a good hiding&minus;place when once you got there, but
            the getting there was very dangerous. For the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different place
            every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. In the street it was usually possible to talk,
            after a fashion. As they drifted down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at one
            another, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flicked on and off like the beams of a
            lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a
            telescreen, then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly cut short as they
            parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without introduction on the following day. Julia appeared
            to be quite used to this kind of conversation, which she called 'talking by instalments'. She was also
            surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once in almost a month of nightly meetings they
            managed to exchange a kiss. They were passing in silence down a side&minus;street (Julia would never speak
            when they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the earth heaved, and the air
            darkened, and Winston found himself lying on his side, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must have
            dropped quite near at hand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a few centimetres from his own, deathly
            white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were white. She was dead! He clasped her against him and found that

            to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part&minus;time munition work which was
            done voluntarily by zealous Party members. So, one evening every week, Winston spent four hours of
            paralysing boredom, screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses, in a
            draughty, ill&minus;lit workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the
            telescreens.</p>

        <p>When they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conversation were filled up. It was a blazing
            afternoon. The air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smelt</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>overpoweringly of pigeon dung. They sat talking for hours on the dusty, twig&minus; littered floor, one or
            other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one
            was coming.</p>

            women! How I hate women!' she said parenthetically), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the
            novel&minus;writing machines in the Fiction Department. She enjoyed her work, which consisted chiefly in

        <p>a powerful but tricky electric motor. She was 'not clever', but was fond of using her hands and felt at home
            with machinery. She could describe the whole process of composing a novel, from the general directive issued
            by the Planning Committee down to the final touching&minus;up by the Rewrite Squad. But she was not
            interested in the finished product. She 'didn't much care for reading,' she said. Books were just a
            commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only person she had ever known who talked
            frequently of the days before the Revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight. At
            school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years running. She had
            been a troop&minus;leader in the Spies and a branch secretary in the Youth League before joining the Junior
            Anti&minus;Sex League. She had always borne an excellent character. She had even (an infallibIe mark of good
            reputation) been picked out to work in Pornosec, the sub&minus; section of the Fiction Department which
            turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck House by the people
            who worked in it, she remarked. There she had remained for a year, helping to produce booklets in sealed
            packets with titles like <em>Spanking Stories</em> or <em>One Night in a Girls' School,</em> to be bought
            furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What are these books like?' said Winston curiously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Oh, ghastly rubbish. They're boring, really. They only have six plots, but they swap them round a bit. Of
            course I was only on the kaleidoscopes. I was never in the Rewrite Squad. I'm not literary, dear not even
            enough for that.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He learned with astonishment that all the workers in Pornosec, except the heads of the departments, were
            girls. The theory was that men, whose sex instincts were less controllable than those of women, were in
            greater danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'They don't even like having&nbsp; married&nbsp; women&nbsp; there,'&nbsp; she&nbsp; added.&nbsp; Girls are
            always supposed to be so pure.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They did not discuss the possibility of getting married. It was too remote to be worth thinking about. No
            imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if Katharine, Winston's wife, could somehow
            have been got rid of. It was hopeless even as a daydream.</p>

        <p>'She was do you know the Newspeak word <em>goodthinkful?</em> Meaning naturally orthodox, incapable of
            thinking a bad thought?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No,&nbsp; I&nbsp; didn't&nbsp; know&nbsp; the&nbsp; word,&nbsp; but&nbsp; I know the kind of&nbsp;
            person,&nbsp; right enough.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He began telling her the story of his married life, but curiousIy enough she appeared to know the essential
            parts of it already. She described to him, almost as though she had seen or felt it, the stiffening of
            Katharine's body as soon as he touched her, the way in which she still seemed to be pushing him from her
            with all her strength, even when her arms were clasped tightly round him. With Julia he felt no difficulty
            in talking about such things: Katharine, in any case, had long ceased to be a painful memory and became
            merely a distasteful one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing,' he said. He toId her about the frigid little
            ceremony that Katharine had forced him to go through on the same night every week. 'She hated it, but
            nothing would make her stop doing it. She used to call it but you'll never guess.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Our duty to the Party,' said Julia promptly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'How did you know that?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I've been at school too, dear. Sex talks once a month for the over&minus;sixteens. And in the Youth
            Movement. They rub it into you for years. I dare say it works in a lot of cases. But of course you can never
            tell; peopIe are such hypocrites.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She began to enlarge upon the subject. With Julia, everything came back to her own sexuality. As soon as this
            was touched upon in any way she was capable of great acuteness. Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner
            meaning of the Party's sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own
            which was outside the Party's control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was more
            important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable because it could be transformed
            into war&minus;fever and leader&minus;worship. The way she put it was:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'When you make love you're using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy and don't give a damn for anything.
            They can't bear you to feel like that. They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this
            marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simpIy sex gone sour. If you're happy inside yourself,
            why should you get excited about Big Brother and the Three&minus;Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all
            the rest of their bloody rot?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was very true, he thought. There was a direct intimate connexion between chastity and political
            orthodoxy. For how could the fear, the hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its
            members be kept at the right pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving
            force? The sex impulse was dangerous to the Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They had played a
            similar trick with the instinct of parenthood. The family could not actually be abolished, and, indeed,
            people were encouraged to be fond of their children, in almost the old&minus;fashioned way. The children, on
            the other hand, were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their
            deviations. The family had become in effect an extension of the Thought Police. It was a device by means of
            which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.</p>

        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>another sweltering&nbsp; summer afternoon, eleven years ago.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was three or four months after they were married. They had lost their way on a community hike somewhere in
            Kent. They had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and
            presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry. It was a sheer drop of ten or
            twenty metres, with boulders at the bottom. There was nobody of whom they could ask the way. As soon as she
            realized that they were lost Katharine became very uneasy. To be away from the noisy mob of hikers even for
            a moment gave her a feeling of wrong&minus; doing. She wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and
            start searching in the other direction. But at this moment Winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing
            in the cracks of the cliff beneath them. One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick&minus;red,
            apparently growing on the same root. He had never seen anything of the kind before, and he called to
            Katharine to come and look at it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Look, Katharine ! Look at those flowers. That clump down near the bottom. Do you see they're two different
            colours?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully come back for a moment. She even leaned out over
            the cliff face to see where he was pointing. He was standing a little behind her, and he put his hand on her
            waist to steady her. At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they were. There was
            not a human creature anywhere, not a leaf stirring, not even a bird awake. In a place like this the danger
            that there would be a hidden microphone was very small, and even if there was a microphone it would only
            pick up sounds. It was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon. The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat
            tickled his face. And the thought struackhim . . .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Why didn't you give her a good&nbsp; shove?'&nbsp; said&nbsp; Julia.&nbsp; 'I&nbsp; would&nbsp; have.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, dear, you would have. I would, if I'd been the same person then as I am now. Or perhaps I would I'm not
            certain.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Are you sorry you didn't?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes. On the whole I'm sorry I didn't.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. He pulled her closer against him. Her head rested on his
            shoulder, the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeon dung. She was very young, he thought, she
            still expected something from life, she did not understand that to push an inconvenient person over a cliff

        <p>'Then why are you sorry you didn't do it?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In this game that we're playing, we can't win. Some kinds of

        <p>He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. She always contradicted him when he said anything of this
            kind. She would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated. In a way she
            realized that she herself was doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police would catch her and kill her,
            but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to construat a secret world in
            which you could live as you chose. All you needed was luack and cunningk and boldness. She did not
            understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the only victory lay in the far future, longk
            after you were dead, that from</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the moment of&nbsp; declaring war on the Party it was better to think&nbsp; of&nbsp; yourself&nbsp; as a
            corpse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We are the dead,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We're not dead yet,' said Julia prosaically.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Not physically. Six months, a year five years, conceivably. I am afraid of death. You are young, so
            presumably you're more afraid of it than I am. Obviously we shall put it off as long as we can. But it makes
            very little difference. So long as human beings stay human, death and life are the same thing.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Oh, rubbish! Which would you sooner sleep with, me or a skeleton? Don't you enjoy being alive? Don't you
            like feeling: This is me, this is my hand, this is my leg, I'm real, I'm solid, I'm alive! Don't you like
            <em>this?'</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him. He could feel her breasts, ripe yet firm,
            through her overalls. Her body seemed to be pouring some of its youth and vigour into his.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, I like that,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Then stop talking about dying. And now listen, dear, we've got to fix up about the next time we meet. We may
            as well go back to the place in the wood. We've given it a good long rest. But you must get there by a
            different way this time. I've got it all planned out. You take the train but look, I'll draw it out for
            you.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust, and with a twig from a pigeon's nest
            began drawing a map on the floor.</p>

        <p>Winston looked round the shabby little room above Mr Charrington's shop. Beside the window the enormous bed
            was made up, with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster. The old&minus;fashioned clock with the
            twelve&minus;hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gateleg table, the glass
            paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the half&minus;darkness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups, provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit
            the burner and set a pan of water to boil. He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and some
            saccharine tablets. The clock's hands said seventeen&minus;twenty: it was nineteen&minus; twenty really. She
            was coming at nineteen&minus;thirty.</p>

        <p>Norman pillar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle, was stumping to and
            fro between a washtub and a clothes line, pegging out a series of square white things which Winston
            recognized as babies' diapers. Whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a
            powerful contralto:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was only an 'opeless fancy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It passed like an Ipril dye,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tune had been haunting London for weeks past. It was one of countless similar songs published for the
            benefit of the proles by a sub&minus;section of the Music Department. The words of these songs were composed
            without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator. But the woman sang so
            tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound. He could hear the woman singing and
            the scrape of her shoes on the flagstones, and the cries of the children in the street, and somewhere in the
            far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet the room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of a
            telescreen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than
            a few weeks without being caught. But the temptation of having a hiding&minus;place that was truly their
            own, indoors and near at hand, had been too much for both of them. For some time after their visit to the
            church belfry it had been impossible to arrange meetings. Working hours had been drastically increased in
            anticipation of Hate Week. It was more than a month distant, but the enormous, complex preparations that it
            entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody. Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon
            on the same day. They had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. On the evening beforehand they met
            briefly in the street. As usual, Winston hardly looked at Julia as they drifted towards one another in the
            crowd, but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's all off,' she murmured as soon as she judged it safe&nbsp; to&nbsp; speak. 'Tomorrow, I mean.'</p>

        <p>trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household. He wished above all that they had some place where
            they could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they met. It was not
            actually at that moment, but at some time on the following day, that the idea of renting Mr Charrington's
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>room had occurred to him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected readiness. Both of
            them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As
            he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love. It was
            curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future
            times, preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone
            it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilful act, one chose to shorten the interval
            before it happened.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia burst into the room. She was carrying a
            tool&minus;bag of coarse brown canvas, such as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the
            Ministry. He started forward to take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly, partly
            because she was still holding the tool&minus;bag.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Half a second,' she said. 'Just let me show you what I've brought. Did you bring some of that filthy Victory
            Coffee? I thought you would. You can chuck it away again, because we shan't be needing it. Look here.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out&nbsp; some&nbsp; spanners and a screwdriver that
            filled the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>top part of it. Underneath were a number of neat paper packets. The first packet that she passed to Winston
            had a strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind of heavy, sand&minus;like stuff
            which yielded wherever you touched it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It isn't sugar?' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here's a loaf of bread proper white bread, not our bloody stuff and a
            little pot of jam. And here's a tin of milk but look! This is the one I'm really proud of. I had to wrap a
            bit of sacking round it, because&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up. The smell was already filling the room, a rich
            hot smell which seemed like an emanation from his early childhood, but which one did occasionally meet with
            even now, blowing down a passage&minus;way before a door slammed, or diffusing itself mysteriously in a
            crowded street, sniffed for an instant and then lost again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's coffee,' he murmured, 'real coffee.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's Inner Party coffee. There's a whole kilo&nbsp; here,&nbsp; she&nbsp; said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'How did you manage to get hold of all these things?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's all Inner Party stuff. There's nothing those swine don't have, nothing. But of course waiters and
            servants and people pinch things, and look, I got a little packet of tea as well.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston had squatted down&nbsp; beside&nbsp; her.&nbsp; He&nbsp; tore&nbsp; open&nbsp; a&nbsp; corner&nbsp;
            of the packet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's real tea. Not blackberry leaves.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'There's been a lot of tea about lately. They've captured India, or something,' she said vaguely. 'But
            listen, dear. I want you to turn your back on me for three minutes. Go and sit on the other side of the bed.
            Don't go too near the window. And don't turn round till I tell you.'</p>

        <p>Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain. Down in the yard the red&minus;armed woman was still
            marching to and fro between the washtub and the line. She took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with
            deep feeling:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They sye that time 'eals all things,</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They twist my 'eart&minus;strings yet!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed. Her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air,
            very tuneful, charged with a sort of happy melancholy. One had the feeling that she would have been</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>perfectly content, if the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible, to remain
            there for a thousand years, pegging out diapers and singing rubbish. It struck him as a curious fact that he
            had never heard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously. It would even have seemed slightly
            unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to oneself. Perhaps it was only when people were
            somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You can turn round now,' said Julia.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her. What he had actually expected was to see
            her naked. But she was not naked. The transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that.
            She had painted her face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought herself a complete set of
            make&minus;up materials. Her lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even
            a touch of something under the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully done, but Winston's
            standards in such matters were not high. He had never before seen or imagined a woman of the Party with
            cosmetics on her face. The improvement in her appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colour in
            the right places she had become not only very much prettier, but, above all, far more feminine. Her short
            hair and boyish overalls merely added to the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets
            flooded his nostrils. He remem bered the half&minus;darkness of a basement kitchen, and a woman's cavernous
            mouth. It was the very same scent that she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Scent too!' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I'm going to do next? I'm going to get hold of a real woman's
            frock from somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers. I'll wear silk stockings and
            high&minus;heeled shoes! In this room I'm going to be a woman, not a Party comrade.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed. It was the first time that he had
            stripped himself naked in her presence. Until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body,
            with the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch over his ankle. There were no
            sheets, but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth, and the size and springiness of the bed
            astonished both of them. 'It's sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?' said Julia. One never saw a double
            bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles. Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Julia
            had never been in one before, so far as she could remember.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to
            nearly nine. He did not stir, because Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. Most of her
            make&minus;up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light stain of rouge still
            brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed
            and lighted up the fireplace, where the water in the pan was boiling fast. Down in the yard the woman had
            stopped singing, but</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the faint shouts of children floated in from the street. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it
            had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman
            with no clothes on, making love when they chose, talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to
            get up, simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely there could never have been a
            time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up, rubbed her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at
            the oilstove.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Half that water's boiled away,' she said. 'I'll get up and make some coffee in another moment. We've got an
            hour. What time do they cut the lights off at your flats?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Twenty&minus;three thirty.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's twenty&minus;three at the hostel. But you have to get in earlier than that, because Hi! Get out, you
            filthy brute!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a shoe from the floor, and sent it hurtling into the
            corner with a boyish jerk of her arm, exactly as he had seen her fling the dictionary at Goldstein, that
            morning during the Two Minutes Hate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What was it?' he said in surprise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting. There's a hole down there. I gave him a good
            fright, anyway.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Rats!' murmured Winston. 'In this room!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'They're all over the place,' said Julia indifferently as she lay down again. 'We've even got them in the
            kitchen at the hostel. Some parts of London are swarming with them. Did you know they attack children? Yes,
            they do. In some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for two minutes. It's the great huge
            brown ones that do it. And the nasty thing is that the brutes always&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>'Don't&nbsp; go on!'</em> said Winston, with his eyes tightly&nbsp; shut.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Dearest! You've gone quite pale. What's&nbsp; the&nbsp; matter?&nbsp; Do&nbsp; they&nbsp; make you feel
            sick?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Of all horrors in the world&nbsp; a rat!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him, as though to reassure him with the warmth of
            her body. He did not reopen his eyes immediately. For several moments he had had the feeling of being back
            in a nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. It was always very much the same.
            He was standing in front of a wall of darkness, and on the other side of it there was something unendurable,
            something too dreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self&minus;
            deception, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness. With a deadly effort, like
            wrenching a piece out of his own brain, he could even have dragged the thing into the open. He always woke
            up without discovering what it was: but somehow it was connected with what Julia had been saying when he cut
            her short.</p>

        <p>'I'm sorry,' he said, 'it's nothing. I&nbsp; don't&nbsp; like&nbsp; rats,&nbsp; that's&nbsp; all.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Don't worry, dear, we're not going to have the filthy brutes in here. I'll stuff the hole with a bit of
            sacking before we go. And next time we come here I'll bring some plaster and bung it up properly.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Already the black instant of panic was half&minus;forgotten. Feeling slightly ashamed of himself, he sat up
            against the bedhead. Julia got out of bed, pulled on her overalls, and made the coffee. The smell that rose
            from the saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should notice
            it and become inquisitive. What was even better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to
            it by the sugar, a thing Winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine. With one hand in her pocket
            and a piece of bread and jam in the other, Julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the
            bookcase, pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping herself down in the ragged
            arm&minus;chair to see if it was comfortable, and examining the absurd twelve&minus;hour clock with a sort
            of tolerant amusement. She brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better
            light. He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft, rainwatery appearance of the glass.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What is it, do you think?' said Julia.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I don't think it's anything&minus;I mean, I don't think it was ever put to any use. That's what I like about
            it. It's a little chunk of history that they've forgotten to alter. It's a message from a hundred years ago,
            if one knew how to read it.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'And that picture over there' she nodded at the engraving on the opposite wall&minus;'would that be a hundred
            years old?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'More. Two hundred, I&nbsp; dare&nbsp; say.&nbsp; One&nbsp; can't&nbsp; tell.&nbsp; It's&nbsp; impossible to
            discover the age of anything nowadays.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She went over to look at it. 'Here's where that brute stuck his nose out,' she said, kicking the wainscoting
            immediately below the picture. 'What is this place? I've seen it before somewhere.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It's a church, or at least it used to be. St Clement Danes its name was.' The fragment of rhyme that Mr
            Charrington had taught him came back into his head, and he added half&minus;nostalgically: "Oranges and
            lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To his astonishment she capped the line:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey&nbsp; '</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I can't remember how it goes on after that. But anyway I remember it ends up, "Here comes a candle to light
            you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was like the two halves of&nbsp; a&nbsp; countersign.&nbsp; But&nbsp; there&nbsp; must&nbsp; be&nbsp;
            another line after 'the bells of Old Bailey'.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps&nbsp; it could be&nbsp; dug out of Mr&nbsp; Charrington's&nbsp; memory,&nbsp; if&nbsp; he&nbsp;
            were&nbsp; suitably prompted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Who taught you that?' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a little girl. He was vaporized when I was eight at any
            rate, he disappeared. I wonder what a lemon was,' she added inconsequently. 'I've seen oranges. They're a
            kind of round yellow fruit with a thick skin.'</p>

        <p>'I can remember lemons,' said Winston. 'They were quite common in the fifties. They were so sour that it set
            your teeth on edge even to smell them.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I bet that picture's got bugs behind it,' said Julia. 'I'll take it down and give it a good clean some day.
            I suppose it's almost time we were leaving. I must start washing this paint off. What a bore! I'll get the
            lipstick off your face afterwards.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston did not get up for a few minutes more. The room was darkening. He turned over towards the light and
            lay gazing into the glass paperweight. The inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but
            the interior of the glass itself. There was such a depth of it, and yet it was almost as transparent as air.
            It was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its
            atmosphere complete. He had the feeling that he could get inside it, and that in fact he was inside it,
            along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table, and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight
            itself. The paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was Julia's life and his own, fixed in a sort
            of eternity at the heart of the crystal.</p>

        <p>Syme had vanished. A morning came, and he was missing from work: a few thoughtless people commented on his
            absence. On the next day nobody mentioned him. On the third day Winston went into the vestibule of the
            Records Department to look at the notice&minus;board. One of the notices carried a printed list of the
            members of the Chess Committee, of whom Syme had been one. It looked almost exactly as it had looked before
            nothing had been crossed out but it was one name shorter. It was enough. Syme had ceased to exist: he had
            never existed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The weather was baking hot. In the labyrinthine Ministry the windowless, air&minus;conditioned rooms kept
            their normal temperature, but outside the pavements scorched one's feet and the stench of the Tubes at the
            rush hours was a horror. The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, and the staffs of all the
            Ministries were working overtime. Processions, meetings, military parades, lectures, waxworks, displays,
            film shows, telescreen programmes all had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigies built, slogans
            coined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographs faked. Julia's unit in the Fiction Department had
            been taken off the production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets. Winston, in
            addition to his regular work, spent long periods every day in going through back files of <em>The Times</em>
            and altering and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches. Late at night, when crowds of
            rowdy proles roamed the streets, the town had a curiously febrile air. The rocket bombs crashed oftener than
            ever, and sometimes in</p>

        <p>A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London. It had no caption, and represented simply the monstrous
            figure of a Eurasian soldier, three or four metres high, striding forward with expressionless Mongolian face
            and enormous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. From whatever angle you looked at the poster, the
            muzzle of the gun, magnified by the foreshortening, seemed to be pointed straight at you. The thing had been
            plastered on every blank space on every wall, even outnumbering the portraits of Big Brother. The proles,
            normally apathetic about the war, were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism. As
            though to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than
            usual. One fell on a crowded film theatre in Stepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins. The
            whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long, trailing funeral which went on for hours and
            was in effect an indignation meeting. Another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a
            playground and several dozen children were blown to pieces. There were further angry demonstrations,
            Goldstein was burned in effigy, hundreds of copies of the poster of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and
            added to the flames, and a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew round that spies
            were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, and an old couple who were suspected of being of
            foreign extraction had their house set on fire and perished of suffocation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the room over Mr Charrington's shop, when they could get there, Julia and Winston lay side by side on a
            stripped bed under the open window, naked for the sake of coolness. The rat had never come back, but the
            bugs had multiplied hideously in the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty or clean, the room was paradise.
            As soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black market, tear off
            their clothes, and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs had
            rallied and were massing for the counter&minus;attack.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Four,&nbsp; five,&nbsp; six&nbsp; seven times they met during the month&nbsp; of&nbsp; June. Winston had
            dropped his habit of drinking</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>gin at all hours. He seemed to have lost the need for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had
            subsided, leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of coughing in the early morning
            had stopped. The process of life had ceased to be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at
            the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice. Now that they had a secure hiding&minus; place,
            almost a home, it did not even seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of
            hours at a time. What mattered was that the room over the junk&minus; shop should exist. To know that it was
            there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. The room was a world, a pocket of the past where
            extinct animals could walk. Mr Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal. He usually stopped
            to talk with Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs. The old man seemed seldom or never to go
            out of doors, and on the other hand to have almost no customers. He led a ghostlike existence between the
            tiny, dark shop, and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his meals and which contained, among
            other things, an unbelievably ancient gramophone with an enormous horn. He seemed glad of the opportunity to
            talk. Wandering about among his worthless stock, with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed
            shoulders</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>in&nbsp; the velvet jacket, he&nbsp; had always vaguely the air of being a&nbsp; collector rather&nbsp;

        <p>illusion not only of safety but of permanence. So long as they were actually in this room, they both felt, no
            harm could come to them. Getting there was difficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It
            was as when Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that it would be possible
            to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside it time could be arrested. Often they gave themselves
            up to daydreams of escape. Their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their intrigue, just
            like this, for the remainder of their natural lives. Or Katharine would die, and by subtle manoeuvrings
            Winston and Julia would succeed in getting married. Or they would commit suicide together. Or they would
            disappear, alter themselves out of recognition, learn to speak with proletarian accents, get jobs in a
            factory and live out their lives undetected in a back&minus;street. It was all nonsense, as they both knew.
            In reality there was no escape. Even the one plan that was practicable, suicide, they had no intention of
            carrying out. To hang on from day to day and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future,
            seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one's lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is
            air available.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the Party, but with no notion of how to
            take the first step. Even if the fabulous Brotherhood was a reality, there still remained the difficulty of
            finding one's way into it. He told her of the strange intimacy that existed, or seemed to exist, between
            himself and O'Brien, and of the impulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into O'Brien's presence, announce
            that he was the enemy of the Party, and demand his help. Curiously enough, this did not strike her as an
            impossibly rash thing to do. She was used to judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her
            that Winston should believe O'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes.
            Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly everyone, secretly hated the Party and would break
            the rules if he thought it safe to do so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organized opposition
            existed or could exist. The tales about Goldstein and his underground army, she said, were simply a lot of
            rubbish which the Party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in. Times
            beyond number, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations, she had shouted at the top of her voice for
            the execution of people</p>

        <p>matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance
            remark that she did not remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasia and at peace
            with Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham: but apparently she had not even</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>noticed that the name of the enemy had changed. 'I thought we'd always been at war with Eurasia,' she said
            vaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth, but the
            switchover in the war had happened only four years ago, well after she was grown up. He argued with her
            about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcing her memory back until she did
            dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and not Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still struck her as
            unimportant. 'Who cares?' she said impatiently. 'It's always one bloody war after another, and one knows the
            news is all lies anyway.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department and the impudent forgeries that he committed there. Such
            things did not appear to horrify her. She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of
            lies becoming truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford and the momentous slip of
            paper which he had once held between his fingers. It did not make much impression on her. At first, indeed,
            she failed to grasp the point of the story.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Were they friends of yours?' she said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No, I never knew them. They were Inner Party members. Besides, they were far older men than I was. They
            belonged to the old days, before the Revolution. I barely knew them by sight.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Then&nbsp; what&nbsp; was&nbsp; there&nbsp; to&nbsp; worry about? People are being&nbsp; killed&nbsp; off
            all the time, aren't they?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He tried to make her understand. 'This was an exceptional case. It wasn't just a question of somebody being
            killed. Do you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives
            anywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there. Already
            we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has
            been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue
            and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by
            day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party
            is always right. I <em>know,</em> of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for
            me to prove it,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>even when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only
            evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't know with any certainty that any other human being shares my
            memories. Just in that one instance, in my whole life, I did possess actual concrete evidence <em>after</em>
            the event years after it.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'And what good was that?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It was no good, because I threw it away a few minutes later. But if the same thing happened today, I should
            keep it.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Well, I wouldn't!' said Julia. 'I'm quite ready to take risks, but only for something worth while, not for
            bits of old newspaper. What could you have done with it even if you had kept it?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Not much, perhaps. But it was evidence. It might have planted a few doubts here and there, supposing that
            I'd dared to show it to anybody. I don't imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime. But one can
            imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there small groups of people banding themselves
            together, and gradually growing, and even leaving a few records behind, so that the next generations can
            carry on where we leave off.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I'm not interested in&nbsp; the&nbsp; next&nbsp; generation,&nbsp; dear.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp; interested in
            <em>us</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You're&nbsp; only&nbsp; a&nbsp; rebel from the waist downwards,' he told&nbsp; her.</p>

        <p>She thought this brilliantly&nbsp; witty&nbsp; and&nbsp; flung&nbsp; her&nbsp; arms&nbsp; round&nbsp; him in
            delight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest. Whenever he began to talk of the
            principles of Ingsoc, doublethink, the mutability of the past, and the denial of objective reality, and to
            use Newspeak words, she became bored and confused and said that she never paid any attention to that kind of
            thing. One knew that it was all rubbish, so why let oneself be worried by it? She knew when to cheer and
            when to boo, and that was all one needed. If he persisted in talking of such subjects, she had a
            disconcerting habit of falling asleep. She was one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in
            any position. Talking to her, he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having
            no grasp</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>whatever of what&nbsp; orthodoxy&nbsp; meant.&nbsp; In&nbsp; a&nbsp; way,&nbsp; the&nbsp;
            world&minus;view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Party&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; itself&nbsp; most&nbsp; successfully</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>on people&nbsp; incapable&nbsp; of&nbsp; understanding&nbsp; it.&nbsp; They&nbsp; could&nbsp; be&nbsp;
            made&nbsp; to&nbsp; accept&nbsp; the&nbsp; most&nbsp; flagrant&nbsp; violations of&nbsp; reality,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>because they never fully grasped the&nbsp; enormity of&nbsp; what&nbsp; was&nbsp; demanded&nbsp; of them, and
            were not sufficiently</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>interested in&nbsp; public&nbsp; events&nbsp; to&nbsp; notice&nbsp; what&nbsp; was&nbsp; happening.&nbsp;
            By&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; understanding&nbsp; they&nbsp; remained&nbsp; sane.&nbsp; They</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>simply&nbsp; swallowed&nbsp; everything, and what they swallowed did them no&nbsp; harm,&nbsp; because&nbsp;
            it&nbsp; left&nbsp; no&nbsp; residue behind,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>just as a grain of corn will&nbsp; pass&nbsp; undigested through the body of a bird.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It had happened at last. The expected message had come. All his life, it seemed to him, he had been waiting
            for this to happen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry and he was almost at the spot where Julia had slipped
            the note into his hand when he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him.
            The person, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude to speaking. Winston stopped abruptly
            and turned. It was O'Brien.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse was to run away. His heart bounded
            violently. He would have been incapable of speaking. O'Brien, however, had continued forward in the same
            movement, laying a friendly hand for a moment on Winston's arm, so that the two of them were walking side by
            side. He began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of Inner
            Party members.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,' he said. 'I was reading one of your Newspeak
            articles in <em>The Times</em> the other day. You take a scholarly interest in Newspeak, I believe?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston had recovered part of his self&minus;possession. 'Hardly scholarly,' he said. 'I'm only an amateur.
            It's not my subject. I have never had anything to do with the actual construction of the language.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'But you write it very elegantly,' said O'Brien. 'That is not only my own opinion. I was talking recently to
            a friend of yours who is certainly an expert. His name has slipped my memory for the moment.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Again Winston's heart stirred painfully. It was inconceivable that this was anything other than a reference
            to Syme. But Syme was not only dead, he was abolished, an <em>unperson.</em> Any identifiable reference to
            him would have been mortally dangerous. O'Brien's remark must obviously have been intended as a signal, a
            codeword. By sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices. They had
            continued</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>to stroll slowly down the corridor, but now O'Brien halted. With the curious, disarming friendliness that he
            always managed to put in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose. Then he went on:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What I had really intended to say was that in your article I noticed you had used two words which have
            become obsolete. But they have only become so very recently. Have you seen the tenth edition of the Newspeak
            Dictionary?'</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No,' said Winston. 'I didn't think it had been issued yet. We are still using the ninth in the Records
            Department.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months, I believe. But a few advance copies have been
            circulated. I have one myself. It might interest you to look at it, perhaps?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Very&nbsp; much&nbsp; so,'&nbsp; said&nbsp; Winston, immediately seeing where&nbsp; this&nbsp; tended.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Some of the new developments are most ingenious. The reduction in the number of verbs that is the point that
            will appeal to you, I think. Let me see, shall I send a messenger to you with the dictionary? But I am
            afraid I invariably forget anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pick it up at my flat at some time that
            suited you? Wait. Let me give you my address.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were standing in front of a telescreen. Somewhat absentmindedly O'Brien felt two of his pockets and then
            produced a small leather&minus;covered notebook and a gold ink&minus; pencil. Immediately beneath the
            telescreen, in such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could read
            what he was writing, he scribbled an address, tore out the page and handed it to Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I&nbsp; am usually at home in the evenings,' he said. 'If not,&nbsp; my&nbsp; servant will give you the
            dictionary.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper, which this time there was no need to conceal.
            Nevertheless he carefully memorized what was written on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory
            hole along with a mass of other papers.</p>

        <p>O'Brien had been saying to him. Perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary.
            But at any rate, one thing was certain. The conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and he had reached
            the outer edges of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He knew that sooner or later he would obey O'Brien's summons. Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay he
            was not certain. What was happening was only the working&minus;out of a process that had started years ago.
            The first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second had been the opening of the diary. He had
            moved from thoughts to words, and now from words to actions. The last step was something that would happen
            in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted it. The end was contained in the beginning. But it was frightening:
            or, more exactly, it was like a foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. Even whiIe he was
            speaking to O'Brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a chilly shuddering feeling had taken
            possession of his body. He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much
            better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him.</p>

        <p>Winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. Julia rolled sleepily against him, murmuring something that
            might have been 'What's the matter?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I dreamt&minus;' he began, and stopped short. It was too complex to be put into words. There was the dream
            itself, and there was a memory connected with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after
            waking.</p>

        <p>selfish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. He would cry
            out with rage when she stopped ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands, he
            would grab bits from his sister's plate. He knew that he was starving the other two, but he could not help
            it; he even felt that he had a right to do it. The clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him.
            Between meals, if his mother did not stand guard, he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food
            on the shelf.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One day a chocolate&minus;ration was issued. There had been no such issue for weeks or months past. He
            remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate. It was a two&minus;ounce slab (they still
            talked about ounces in those days) between the three of them. It was obvious that it ought to be divided
            into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he were listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself
            demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece. His mother told him not to be
            greedy. There was a long, nagging argument that went round and round, with shouts, whines, tears,
            remonstrances, bargainings. His tiny sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a baby
            monkey, sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. In the end his mother broke off
            three&minus;quarters of the chocolate and gave it to Winston, giving the other quarter to his sister. The
            little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. Winston stood watching
            her for a moment. Then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister's
            hand and was fleeing for the door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Winston,&nbsp; Winston!'&nbsp; his&nbsp; mother&nbsp; called after him. 'Come&nbsp; back!&nbsp; Give your
            sister back her chocolate!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stopped, but did not come back. His mother's anxious eyes were fixed on his face. Even now he was thinking
            about the thing, he did not know what it was that was on the point of happening. His sister, conscious of
            having been robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. His mother drew her arm round the child and
            pressed its face against her breast. Something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying. He turned
            and fled down the stairs. with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He never saw his mother again. After he had&nbsp; devoured&nbsp; the&nbsp; chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed
            of himself</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and hung about in the streets for several hours, until hunger drove him home. When he came back his mother
            had disappeared. This was already becoming normal at that time. Nothing was gone from the room except his
            mother and his sister. They had not taken any clothes, not even his mother's overcoat. To this day he did
            not know with any certainty that his mother was dead. It was perfectly possible that she had merely been
            sent to forced&minus;labour camp. As for his sister, she might have been removed, like Winston himself, to
            one of the colonies for homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were called) which had grown up as a
            result of the civil war, or she might have been sent to the labour camp along with his mother, or simply
            left somewhere or other to die.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its
            whole meaning seemed to be contained. His mind went back to another dream of two months ago. Exactly as his
            mother had sat on the dingy whitequilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so she had sat in the sunken
            ship, far underneath him, and drowning deeper every minute, but still looking up at him through the
            darkening water.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He told Julia the story of his mother's disappearance. Without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled
            herself into a more comfortable position.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I expect you were a beastly little swine in those&nbsp; days,'&nbsp; she&nbsp; said indistinctly. 'All
            children are swine.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes. But the real point of the story&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again. He would have liked to continue
            talking about his mother. He did not suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an</p>

        <p>unusual woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility, a kind of purity,
            simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones. Her feelings were her own, and could not be
            altered from outside. It would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes
            meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him
            love. When the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in her arms. It was no use,
            it changed nothing, it did not produce more chocolate, it did not avert the child's death or her own; but it
            seemed natural to her to do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with her arm,
            which was no more use against the bullets than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Party had done
            was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing

        <p>'The proles are human beings,' he said aloud. 'We are&nbsp; not&nbsp; human.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Why not?' said Julia, who had woken up again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He thought for a little while. 'Has it ever occurred to you. he said, 'that the best thing for us to do would
            be simply to walk out of here before it's too late, and never see each other again?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes,&nbsp; dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I'm&nbsp; not&nbsp; going to do it, all the
            same.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We've been lucky,' he said 'but it can't last much longer. You're young. You look normal and innocent. If
            you keep clear of people like me, you might stay alive for another fifty years.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No. I've thought it all out. What you do, I'm going to do. And don't be too downhearted. I'm rather good at
            staying alive.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We may be together for another six months a year there's no knowing. At the end we're certain to be apart.
            Do you realize how utterly alone we shall be? When once they get hold of us there will be nothing, literally
            nothing, that either of us can do for the other. If I confess, they'll shoot you, and if I refuse to
            confess, they'll shoot you just the same. Nothing that I can do or say, or stop myself from saying, will put
            off your death for as much as five minutes. Neither of us will even know whether the other is alive or dead.
            We shall</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>be utterly without power of any kind. The one thing that matters is that we shouldn't betray one another,
            although even that can't make the slightest difference.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'If you mean confessing,' she said, 'we shall do that, right enough. Everybody always confesses. You can't
            help it. They torture you.'</p>

        <p>'I don't mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do doesn't matter: only feelings
            matter. If they could make me stop loving you that would be the real betrayal.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She thought it over. 'They can't do that,' she said finally. 'It's the one thing they can't do. They can make
            you say anything <em>any&minus; thing</em> but they can't make you believe it. They can't get inside you.'
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No,' he said a little more hopefully, 'no; that's quite true. They can't get inside you. If you can
            <em>feel</em> that staying human is worth while, even when it can't have any result whatever, you've beaten
            them.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He thought of the telescreen with its never&minus;sleeping ear. They could spy upon you night and day, but if
            you kept your head you could still outwit them. With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret
            of finding out what another human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less true when you were actually in
            their hands. One did not know what happened inside the Ministry of Love, but it was possible to guess:
            tortures, drugs, delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions, gradual wearing&minus;down by
            sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning. Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They
            could be tracked down by enquiry, they could be squeezed out of you by torture. But if the object was not to
            stay alive but to stay human, what difference did it ultimately make? They could not alter your feelings:
            for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in the utmost
            detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious
            even to yourself, remained impregnable.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had done it, they had done it at last!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The room they were standing in was long&minus;shaped and&nbsp; softly&nbsp; lit.&nbsp; The telescreen was
            dimmed to a low</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>murmur; the richness of the dark&minus;blue carpet gave one the impression of treading on velvet. At the far
            end of the room O'Brien was sitting at a table under a green&minus;shaded lamp, with a mass of papers on
            either side of him. He had not bothered to look up when the servant showed Julia and Winston in.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston's heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be able to speak. They had done it,
            they had done it at last, was all he could think. It had been a rash act to come here at all, and sheer
            folly to arrive together; though it was true that they had come by different routes and only met on
            O'Brien's doorstep. But merely to walk into such a place needed an effort of the nerve. It was only on very
            rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling&minus;places of the Inner Party, or even penetrated into the
            quarter of the town where they lived. The whole atmosphere of the huge block of flats, the richness and
            spaciousness of everything, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco, the silent and incredibly
            rapid lifts sliding up and down,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the white&minus;jacketed servants hurrying to and fro everything was intimidating. Although he had a good
            pretext for coming here, he was haunted at every step by the fear that a black&minus;uniformed guard would
            suddenly appear from round the corner, demand his papers, and order him to get out. O'Brien's servant,
            however, had admitted the two of them without demur. He was a small, dark&minus;haired man in a white
            jacket, with a diamond&minus;shaped, completely expressionless face which might have been that of a Chinese.
            The passage down which he led them was softly carpeted, with cream&minus;papered walls and white
            wainscoting, all exquisitely clean. That too was intimidating. Winston could not remember ever to have seen
            a passageway whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human bodies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studying it intently. His heavy face, bent
            down so that one could see the line of the nose, looked both formidable and intelligent. For perhaps twenty
            seconds he sat without stirring. Then he pulled the speakwrite towards him and rapped out a message in the
            hybrid jargon of the Ministries:</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the soundless carpet. A little of the
            official atmosphere seemed to have fallen away from him with the Newspeak words, but his expression was
            grimmer than usual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. The terror that Winston already felt
            was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment. It seemed to him quite possible that he had
            simply made a stupid mistake. For what evidence had he in reality that O'Brien was any kind of political
            conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark: beyond that, only his own secret
            imaginings, founded on a dream. He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the
            dictionary, because in that case Julia's presence was impossible to explain. As O'Brien passed the
            telescreen a thought seemed to strike him. He stopped, turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall. There
            was a sharp snap. The voice had stopped.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. Even in the midst of his panic, Winston was too
            much taken aback to be able to hold his tongue.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You can turn it off!' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes,'&nbsp; said&nbsp; O'Brien,&nbsp; 'we&nbsp; can turn it off. We have that&nbsp; privilege.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was opposite them now. His solid form towered over the pair of them, and the expression on his face was
            still indecipherable. He was waiting, somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what? Even now it
            was quite conceivabIe that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been interrupted. Nobody
            spoke. After the stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent. The seconds marched past,
            enormous. With difficulty Winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O'Brien's. Then suddenly the grim face
            broke down into what might have been the beginnings of a smile. With his characteristic gesture O'Brien
            resettled his spectacles on his nose.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Shall I say it, or will you?' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I will say it,' said Winston&nbsp; promptly.&nbsp; 'That&nbsp; thing&nbsp; is&nbsp; really&nbsp; turned
            off?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, everything is turned off. We are alone.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We have come here because&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of his own motives. Since he did not in fact know what
            kind of help he expected from O'Brien, it was not easy to say why he had come here. He went on, conscious
            that what he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious:</p>

        <p>yellow&minus;faced servant had come in without knocking. Winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a
            decanter and glasses.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Martin is one of us,' said O'Brien impassively. 'Bring the drinks over here, Martin. Put them on the round
            table. Have we enough chairs? Then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort. Bring a chair for yourself,
            Martin. This is business. You can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with a servant&minus;like air, the air of a valet
            enjoying a privilege. Winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye. It struck him that the man's whole
            life was playing a part, and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a
            moment. O'Brien took the decanter by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark&minus; red liquid. It
            aroused in Winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding a vast bottle composed of
            electric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass. Seen from the top the
            stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby. It had a sour&minus;sweet smell. He
            saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It is called wine,' said O'Brien with a faint smile. 'You will have read about it in books, no doubt. Not
            much of it gets to the Outer Party, I am afraid.' His face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: 'I
            think it is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. To our Leader: To Emmanuel Goldstein.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. Wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about. Like the
            glass paperweight or Mr Charrington's half&minus;remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic
            past, the olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reason he had always thought of
            wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect.
            Actually, when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing. The truth was that after years
            of gin&minus;drinking he could barely taste it. He set down the empty glass.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Then there is such a person as Goldstein?' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. Where, I do&nbsp; not&nbsp; know.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'And the conspiracy&nbsp; the organization? Is it real? It is&nbsp; not&nbsp; simply an invention of the
            Thought Police?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No, it is real. The Brotherhood, we call it. You will never learn much more about the Brotherhood than that
            it exists and that you belong to it. I will come back to that presently.' He looked at his
            wrist&minus;watch. 'It is unwise even for members of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for more
            than half an hour. You ought not to have come here together, and you will have to leave separately. You,
            comrade' he bowed his head to Julia 'will leave first. We have about twenty minutes at our disposal. You
            will understand that I must start by asking you certain questions. In general terms, what are you prepared
            to do?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Anything that we are capable of,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing Winston. He almost ignored Julia,
            seeming to take it for granted that Winston could speak for her. For a moment the lids flitted down over his
            eyes. He began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, as though this were a routine, a sort of
            catechism, most of whose answers were known to him already.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are prepared to give your lives?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>

        <p>'You are prepared to commit murder?'</p>

            is likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the Party?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'If, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric acid in a child's face are you
            prepared to do that?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>

        <p>'You are prepared to lose your identity and live&nbsp; out&nbsp; the&nbsp; rest of&nbsp; your life as a
            waiter or a dock&minus;worker?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You&nbsp; are prepared to commit suicide, if and when we order&nbsp; you to&nbsp; do so?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are prepared, the two of you, to separate&nbsp; and&nbsp; never&nbsp; see one&nbsp; another again?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No!' broke in Julia.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It appeared to Winston that a long time passed before he answered. For a moment he seemed even to have been
            deprived of the power of speech. His tongue worked soundlessly, forming the opening syllables first of one
            word, then of the other, over and over again. Until he had said it, he did not know which word he was going
            to say. 'No,' he said finally.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You&nbsp; did well to tell me,' said O'Brien. 'It is necessary&nbsp; for us&nbsp; to know everything.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He turned himself toward Julia and added in a&nbsp; voice&nbsp; with&nbsp; somewhat more expression in it:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a different person? We may be obliged to give him a
            new identity. His face, his movements, the shape of his hands, the colour of his hair even his voice would
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>be different. And you yourself might have become a different person. Our surgeons can alter people beyond
            recognition. Sometimes it is necessary. Sometimes we even amputate a limb.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martin's Mongolian face. There were no scars that
            he could see. Julia had turned a shade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced O'Brien
            boldly. She murmured something that seemed to be assent.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Good. Then that is settled.'</p>

        <p>There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a rather absent&minus;minded air O'Brien pushed them
            towards the others, took one himself, then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could
            think better standing. They were very good cigarettes, very thick and well&minus;packed, with an unfamiliar
            silkiness in the paper. O'Brien looked at his wrist&minus;watch again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You had better go back to your Pantry, Martin,' he said. 'I shall switch on in a quarter of an hour. Take a
            good look at these comrades' faces before you go. You will be seeing them again. I may not.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Exactly&nbsp; as&nbsp; they&nbsp; had&nbsp; done at the front door, the little&nbsp; man's&nbsp; dark eyes
            flickered over their faces.&nbsp; There&nbsp; was&nbsp; not</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>trace of friendliness in his manner. He was memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest in
                them, or appeared to feel none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable of
                changing its expression. Without speaking or giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out, closing the
                door silently behind him. O'Brien was strolling up and down, one hand in the pocket of his black
                overalls, the other holding his cigarette.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You understand,' he said, 'that you will be fighting in the dark. You will always be in the dark. You will
            receive orders and you will obey them, without knowing why. Later I shall send you a book from which you
            will learn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which we shall destroy it. When
            you have read the book, you will be full members of the Brotherhood. But between the general aims that we
            are fighting for and the immedi ate tasks of the moment, you will never know anything. I tell you that the
            Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members, or ten million. From your
            personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen. You will have
            three or four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time as they disappear. As this was your first
            contact, it will be preserved. When you receive orders, they will come from me. If we find it necessary to
            communicate with you, it will be through Martin. When you are finally caught, you will confess. That is
            unavoidable. But you will have very little to confess, other than your own actions. You will not be able to
            betray more than a handful of unimportant people. Probably you will not even betray me. By that time I may
            be dead, or I shall have become a different person, with a different face.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He continued to move to and fro over the soft&nbsp; carpet.&nbsp; In&nbsp; spite&nbsp; of the bulkiness of
            his body there was a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>remarkable grace&nbsp; in his&nbsp; movements. It came out even in the gesture with which he&nbsp; thrust a
            hand&nbsp; into his</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>pocket, or manipulated a cigarette. More&nbsp; even&nbsp; than of&nbsp; strength, he gave an impression of
            confidence and&nbsp; of an</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>understanding&nbsp; tinged by irony. However much in earnest he&nbsp; might be, he had nothing&nbsp; of the
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>single&minus;mindedness that&nbsp; belongs&nbsp; to&nbsp; a&nbsp; fanatic.&nbsp; When&nbsp; he&nbsp;
            spoke&nbsp; of&nbsp; murder, suicide, venereal&nbsp; disease, amputated</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>limbs, and&nbsp; altered&nbsp; faces,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; with&nbsp; a&nbsp; faint&nbsp; air&nbsp;
            of&nbsp; persiflage.&nbsp; 'This&nbsp; is&nbsp; unavoidable,' his voice&nbsp; seemed to say;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'this is what we have got&nbsp; to do,&nbsp; unflinchingly.&nbsp; But&nbsp; this&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp;
            what&nbsp; we&nbsp; shall be doing&nbsp; when life is worth&nbsp; living</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>again.' A wave of admiration, almost of&nbsp; worship,&nbsp; flowed&nbsp; out&nbsp; from&nbsp; Winston&nbsp;
            towards&nbsp; O'Brien.&nbsp; For&nbsp; the&nbsp; moment</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>he had&nbsp; forgotten the shadowy figure of Goldstein. When you&nbsp; looked&nbsp; at&nbsp; O'Brien's&nbsp;
            powerful&nbsp; shoulders&nbsp; and his</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>blunt&minus;featured&nbsp; face, so&nbsp; ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible to believe that&nbsp;
            he&nbsp; could be defeated. There</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was no stratagem that he was not equal&nbsp; to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia&nbsp;
            seemed&nbsp; to&nbsp; be</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>impressed.&nbsp; She&nbsp; had&nbsp; let&nbsp; her&nbsp; cigarette&nbsp; go&nbsp; out&nbsp; and was&nbsp;
            listening&nbsp; intently. O'Brien went on:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You will have heard&nbsp; rumours&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;

        <p>no encouragement. When finally you are caught, you will get no help. We never help our members. At most, when
            it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor
            blade into a prisoner's cell. You will have to get used to living without results and without hope. You will
            work for a while, you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. Those are the only results
            that you will ever see. There is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own
            lifetime. We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust
            and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there is no knowing. It might be a thousand
            years. At present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act
            collectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual, generation after
            generation. In the face of the Thought Police there is no other way.'</p>

        <p>He&nbsp; halted&nbsp; and&nbsp; looked&nbsp; for&nbsp; the third time at his wrist&minus;&nbsp; watch.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It is almost time for you to leave, comrade,' he said&nbsp; to&nbsp; Julia.&nbsp; 'Wait. The decanter is
            still half full.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He&nbsp; filled&nbsp; the&nbsp; glasses&nbsp; and&nbsp; raised his own glass by the&nbsp; stem.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What shall it be this time?' he said, still with the same faint suggestion of irony. 'To the confusion of
            the Thought Police? To the death of Big Brother? To humanity? To the future?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'To the past,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The past is more important,' agreed O'Brien gravely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia stood&nbsp; up to&nbsp; go. O'Brien took a small box
            from the top&nbsp; of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>cabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. It was important,
                he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very observant. As soon as the door
                had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence. He took another pace or two up and down, then
                stopped.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'There are details to be settled,' he said. 'I assume that&nbsp; you&nbsp; have a hiding&minus;place of some
            kind?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston explained about the&nbsp; room&nbsp; over&nbsp; Mr&nbsp; Charrington's&nbsp; shop.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'That will do for the moment. Later we will arrange something else for you. It is important to change one's
            hiding&minus;place frequently. Meanwhile I shall send you a copy of <em>the book'</em> even O'Brien, Winston
            noticed, seemed to pronounce the words as though they were in italics&minus; 'Goldstein's book, you
            understand, as soon as possible. It may be some days before I can get hold of one. There are not many in
            existence, as you can imagine. The Thought Police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can
            produce them. It</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>makes very little difference. The book is indestructible. If the last copy were gone, we could reproduce it
            almost word for word. Do you carry a brief&minus;case to work with you?' he added.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'As a rule, yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What is it like?'</p>

        <p>'Black, very shabby. With two straps.'</p>

        <p>'Black, two straps, very shabby good. One day in the fairly near future&minus;I cannot give a date one of the

            the following day you will go to work without your brief&minus;case. At some time during the day, in the

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were silent for a moment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'There are a couple of minutes before you need go,' said O'Brien. 'We shall meet again if we do meet
            again&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston looked up at him. 'In the place where there is&nbsp; no&nbsp; darkness?' he said hesitantly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien nodded without appearance of surprise. 'In the place where there is no darkness,' he said, as though
            he had recognized the allusion. 'And in the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you
            leave? Any message? Any question?.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston thought. There did not seem to be any further question that he wanted to ask: still less did he feel
            any impulse to utter high&minus;sounding generalities. Instead of anything directly connected with O'Brien
            or the Brotherhood, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where his
            mother had spent her last days, and the little room over Mr Charrington's shop, and the glass paperweight,
            and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame. Almost at random he said:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Did&nbsp; you&nbsp; ever&nbsp; happen&nbsp; to&nbsp; hear an old rhyme that begins&nbsp; "Oranges and
            lemons, say the bells of St Clement's"?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Again O'Brien nodded. With a sort&nbsp; of&nbsp; grave&nbsp; courtesy&nbsp; he&nbsp; completed the stanza:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You knew the last line!' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, I knew the last line. And now, I am afraid, it is time for you to go. But wait. You had better let me
            give you one of these tablets.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Winston stood up O'Brien held out a hand. His powerful grip crushed the bones of Winston's palm. At the
            door Winston looked back, but O'Brien seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind. He was
            waiting with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen. Beyond him Winston could see the
            writing&minus;table with its green&minus; shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deep&minus;
            laden with papers. The incident was closed. Within thirty seconds, it occurred to him, O'Brien would be back
            at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the Party.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston was gelatinous with fatigue. Gelatinous was the right word. It had come into his head spontaneously.
            His body seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly, but its translucency. He felt that if he held up
            his hand he would be able to see the light through it. All the blood and lymph had been drained out of him
            by an enormous debauch of work, leaving only a frail structure of nerves, bones, and skin. All sensations
            seemed to be magnified. His overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled his feet, even the opening
            and closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak.</p>

        <p>He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So&nbsp; had&nbsp; everyone&nbsp; else in the Ministry.
            Now it was all</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>over, and he had literally nothing to do, no Party work of any description, until tomorrow morning. He could
            spend six hours in the hiding&minus;place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, in mild afternoon
            sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the direction of Mr Charrington's shop, keeping one eye open for
            the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with
            him. The heavy brief&minus;case that he was carrying bumped against his knee at each step, sending a
            tingling sensation up and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>down the skin of his leg. Inside it was <em>the book,</em> which he had now had in his possession for six
            days and had not yet opened, nor even looked at.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the speeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners,
            the posters, the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching
            feet, the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the booming of guns after six
            days of this, when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled
            up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war&minus;criminals
            who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them
            to pieces</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>at just this moment it had been announced that Oceania was not after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was at
            war with Eastasia. Eurasia was an ally.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There&nbsp; was,&nbsp; of&nbsp; course,&nbsp; no admission that any change had&nbsp; taken&nbsp; place.
            Merely it became known,&nbsp; with&nbsp; extreme</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>suddenness&nbsp; and&nbsp; everywhere&nbsp; at once, that Eastasia and not Eurasia was the&nbsp; enemy.&nbsp;
            Winston was taking part in</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>a demonstration in one of the&nbsp; central&nbsp; London squares at the moment when it happened.&nbsp;
            It&nbsp; was&nbsp; night, and the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly&nbsp; floodlit.&nbsp; The&nbsp; square was packed with
            several thousand</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>people,&nbsp; including a block of&nbsp; about a&nbsp; thousand&nbsp; schoolchildren&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp;
            uniform of the Spies. On a&nbsp; scarlet&minus;draped</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>platform an orator of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Inner Party, a small lean&nbsp; man with disproportionately long&nbsp;
            arms and a large&nbsp; bald</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>skull&nbsp; over&nbsp; which&nbsp; a&nbsp; few&nbsp; lank&nbsp; locks&nbsp; straggled,&nbsp; was&nbsp;
            haranguing the crowd. A&nbsp; little Rumpelstiltskin&nbsp; figure,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>contorted with hatred,&nbsp; he&nbsp; gripped&nbsp; the&nbsp; neck&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; microphone&nbsp;
            with&nbsp; one hand while the other,&nbsp; enormous at the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>end&nbsp; of a bony arm, clawed the air menacingly above&nbsp; his&nbsp; head.&nbsp; His&nbsp; voice, made
            metallic by the amplifiers,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>boomed forth&nbsp; an endless&nbsp; catalogue&nbsp; of&nbsp; atrocities,&nbsp; massacres,&nbsp;
            deportations,&nbsp; lootings,&nbsp; rapings, torture of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>prisoners,&nbsp; bombing&nbsp; of&nbsp; civilians,&nbsp; lying&nbsp; propaganda,&nbsp; unjust aggressions,
            broken treaties. It was almost</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>impossible to listen to him without being first&nbsp; convinced&nbsp; and&nbsp; then&nbsp; maddened.&nbsp;
            At&nbsp; every&nbsp; few&nbsp; moments&nbsp; the fury</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of the crowd&nbsp; boiled over&nbsp; and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a&nbsp; wild&nbsp;

        <p>uncontrollably from thousands of&nbsp; throats.&nbsp; The&nbsp; most&nbsp; savage&nbsp; yells&nbsp; of&nbsp;
            all&nbsp; came&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; schoolchildren.&nbsp; The</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>speech&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; proceeding for perhaps&nbsp; twenty minutes when a&nbsp; messenger hurried
            on to the platform&nbsp; and&nbsp; a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>scrap&nbsp; of&nbsp; paper&nbsp; was&nbsp; slipped&nbsp; into&nbsp; the speaker's hand. He&nbsp; unrolled and
            read it without&nbsp; pausing&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; speech.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nothing&nbsp; altered&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; voice or manner,&nbsp; or in the content of what he&nbsp; was
            saying, but suddenly&nbsp; the&nbsp; names&nbsp; were</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>different.&nbsp; Without&nbsp; words&nbsp; said, a wave of understanding&nbsp; rippled through the
            crowd.&nbsp; Oceania was at war with</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Eastasia! The next&nbsp; moment there&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp; tremendous&nbsp; commotion.&nbsp; The&nbsp;
            banners and posters&nbsp; with which the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>square was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of them&nbsp; had the&nbsp; wrong faces on them. It was
            sabotage! The</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>agents&nbsp; of&nbsp; Goldstein&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; at work! There was a riotous interlude while&nbsp;
            posters&nbsp; were ripped from the walls,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>banners torn to shreds and&nbsp; trampled&nbsp; underfoot.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Spies&nbsp; performed&nbsp;
            prodigies&nbsp; of&nbsp; activity&nbsp; in&nbsp; clambering&nbsp; over</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the&nbsp; rooftops&nbsp; and cutting the streamers that&nbsp; fluttered from the chimneys. But within two or
            three minutes it</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was all over. The orator, still gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward, his free
            hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech. One minute more, and the feral roars of rage
            were again bursting from the crowd. The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had been
            changed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other
            actually in midsentence, not only without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax. But at the moment
            he had other things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn
            down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Excuse me, I think
            you've dropped your brief&minus;case.' He took the brief&minus;case abstractedly, without speaking. He knew
            that it</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it. The instant that the demonstration was over he
            went straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the time was now nearly twenty&minus;three hours. The entire
            staff of the Ministry had done likewise. The orders already issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to
            their posts, were hardly necessary.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always&nbsp; been&nbsp; at&nbsp; war&nbsp; with Eastasia. A
            large part of the political</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>literature&nbsp; of five years&nbsp; was now completely obsolete. Reports and&nbsp; records&nbsp; of&nbsp;
            all&nbsp; kinds,&nbsp; newspapers,&nbsp; books,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>pamphlets,&nbsp; films,&nbsp; sound&minus;tracks,&nbsp; photographs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp; had&nbsp;
            to&nbsp; be&nbsp; rectified&nbsp; at&nbsp; lightning&nbsp; speed. Although no</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>directive was ever issued, it was&nbsp; known that the chiefs of the&nbsp; Department&nbsp; intended&nbsp;
            that&nbsp; within&nbsp; one&nbsp; week no</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>reference to the war&nbsp; with Eurasia, or the alliance&nbsp; with Eastasia, should remain in&nbsp;
            existence&nbsp; anywhere.&nbsp; The</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>work&nbsp; was overwhelming, all the more so&nbsp; because the processes that it&nbsp; involved&nbsp;
            could&nbsp; not be called by their</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>true names. Everyone in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Records&nbsp; Department&nbsp; worked&nbsp; eighteen&nbsp;
            hours&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; twenty&minus;four,&nbsp; with two</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>three&minus;hour snatches of sleep.&nbsp; Mattresses&nbsp; were brought up from the&nbsp; cellars&nbsp;
            and&nbsp; pitched&nbsp; all&nbsp; over&nbsp; the&nbsp; corridors:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>meals&nbsp; consisted&nbsp; of&nbsp; sandwiches and Victory Coffee&nbsp; wheeled round on trolleys by
            attendants from the canteen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Each&nbsp; time&nbsp; that&nbsp; Winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he&nbsp; tried to&nbsp;
            leave his desk clear of work, and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>each&nbsp; time&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; crawled&nbsp; back&nbsp; sticky&minus;eyed&nbsp; and&nbsp;
            aching,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; to find that&nbsp; another shower of&nbsp; paper cylinders</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>had covered the desk&nbsp; like&nbsp; a&nbsp; snowdrift, halfburying&nbsp; the speakwrite and overflowing on
            to the&nbsp; floor,&nbsp; so&nbsp; that&nbsp; the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>first&nbsp; job was always to stack them into a&nbsp; neat enough pile to give him room&nbsp; to work.
            What&nbsp; was&nbsp; worst&nbsp; of&nbsp; all</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was that the work was by no means purely mechanical. Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for
            another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical knowledge
            that one needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping every few minutes. It was like
            struggling with some crushing physical task, something which one had the right to refuse and which one was
            nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish. In so far as he had time to remember it, he was not
            troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the speakwrite, every stroke of his ink&minus;pencil,
            was a deliberate</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>lie. He was as anxious as anyone else in the&nbsp; Department&nbsp; that the forgery should be perfect.
            On&nbsp; the&nbsp; morning&nbsp; of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the&nbsp; sixth&nbsp; day the dribble of cylinders slowed down. For as&nbsp; much as half an hour&nbsp;
            nothing came out of&nbsp; the&nbsp; tube;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>then&nbsp; one&nbsp; more&nbsp; cylinder, then&nbsp; nothing. Everywhere at about the same time&nbsp; the
            work was easing off. A&nbsp; deep</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and as it were secret sigh went&nbsp; through the Department. A mighty&nbsp; deed,&nbsp; which&nbsp;
            could&nbsp; never&nbsp; be&nbsp; mentioned,&nbsp; had</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>been&nbsp; achieved.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was now impossible for any&nbsp; human being to prove by
            documentary&nbsp; evidence that the war</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>with&nbsp; Eurasia&nbsp; had&nbsp; ever&nbsp; happened.&nbsp; At&nbsp; twelve&nbsp; hundred&nbsp; it&nbsp;
            was&nbsp; unexpectedly announced that all workers in&nbsp; the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ministry&nbsp; were&nbsp; free&nbsp; till&nbsp; tomorrow&nbsp; morning.&nbsp; Winston,&nbsp; still&nbsp;
            carrying&nbsp; the&nbsp; brief&minus;case&nbsp; containing&nbsp; <em>the&nbsp; book,</em> which</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>had&nbsp; remained&nbsp; between&nbsp; his&nbsp; feet&nbsp; while he worked and under his body while&nbsp;
            he&nbsp; slept, went home, shaved</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>himself, and almost fell asleep in his&nbsp; bath, although the water was barely more than tepid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above Mr Charrington's shop. He was
            tired, but not sleepy any longer. He opened the window, lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of
            water for coffee. Julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was <em>the book.</em> He sat down in the
            sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief&minus;case.</p>

            <li>heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the cover. The print also looked
                slightly irregular. The pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart, easily, as though the book had
                passed through many hands. The inscription on the title&minus;page ran:</li>

        <p><em>Emmanuel Goldstein</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston began reading:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Chapter I</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Ignorance is Strength</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of
            people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have
            borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another,
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous
            upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a
            gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable. . .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he <em>was</em> reading, in comfort and
            safety. He was alone: no telescreen, no ear at the keyhole, no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder
            or cover the page with his hand. The sweet summer air played against his cheek. From somewhere far away
            there floated the faint shouts of children: in the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of
            the clock. He settled deeper into the arm&minus;chair and put his feet up on the fender. It was bliss, it
            was etemity. Suddenly, as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read
            and re&minus;read every word, he opened it at a different place and found himself at Chapter III. He went on
            reading:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Chapter III</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>War is Peace</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The splitting up of the world into three great super&minus;states was an event which could be and indeed was
            foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the
            British Empire by the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and Oceania, were already
            effectively in being. The third, Eastasia, only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused
            fighting. The frontiers between the three super&minus;states are in some places arbitrary, and in others
            they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general they follow geographical lines. Eurasia
            comprises the whole of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land&minus;mass, from Portugal to the
            Bering Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands including the British Isles,
            Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa. Eastasia, smaller than the others and with a less definite
            western frontier, comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese islands and a large but
            fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In one combination or another, these three super&minus;states are permanently at war, and have been so for
            the past twenty&minus;five years. War, however, is no longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it
            was in the early decades of the twentieth centary. It is a warfare of limited aims between combatants who
            are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine
            ideological difference. This is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing attitude
            towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous. On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and
            universal in all</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>countries, and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction of whole populations to
            slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as
            normal, and, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy, meritorious. But in a physical
            sense war involves very small numbers of people, mostly highly&minus;trained specialists, and causes</p>

        <p>comparatively few casualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague frontiers whose
            whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round the Floating Fortresses which guard strategic spots
            on the sea lanes. In the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption
            goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact
            changed its character. More exactly, the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of
            importance. Motives which were already present to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth
            centuary have now become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon.</p>

        <p>inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight about. With the
            establishment of self&minus;contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared to one
            another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the
            competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three
            super&minus;states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own
            boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for labour power. Between the
            frontiers of the super&minus; states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them, there lies a
            rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it
            about a fifth of the population of the earth. It is for the possession of these thickly&minus;populated
            regions, and of the northern ice&minus;cap, that the three powers are constantly struggling. In practice no
            one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it
            is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless
            changes of alignment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some of them yield important vegetable
            products such as rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive
            methods. But above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whichever power controls
            equatorial Africa, or the countries of the Middle East, or Southern India, or the Indonesian Archipelago,
            disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds of millions of ill&minus;paid and hard&minus;working
            coolies. The inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves, pass
            continually from conqueror to conqueror, and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out
            more armaments, to capture more territory, to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments, to
            capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It should be noted that the fighting never really moves
            beyond the edges of the disputed areas. The frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of
            the Congo and the northern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands</p>

        <p>nearly every literate person. Science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed
            natural to assume that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly because of the
            impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions, partly because scientific and technical
            progress depended on the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly regimented
            society.</p>

        <p>intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way
            of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example,
            has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo&minus;ships. Ultimately it is scrapped
            as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another
            Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that
            might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are
            always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near
            the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and
            thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth
            century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few
            luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well&minus;appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the
            better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor&minus;car or
            helicopter set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party
            have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call 'the proles'. The social
            atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference
            between wealth and poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger,
            makes the handing&minus;over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of
            survival.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologically
            acceptable way. In principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building
            temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by producing vast quantities of
            goods and then setting fire to them. But this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis
            for</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>hierarchical society. What is concerned here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant
                so long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party
                member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow limits, but it is
                also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear,
                hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the
                mentality appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is actually happening, and,
                since no decisive victory is possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly. All
                that is needed is that a state of war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence which the Party
                requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war, is now almost
                universal, but the higher up the ranks one goes, the more marked it becomes. It is precisely in the
                Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest. In his capacity as an
                administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party to know that this or that item of
                war news is untruthful, and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not
                happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such knowledge is
                easily neutralized by the technique of Meanwhile no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his
                mystical belief that the war <em>is</em> real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with Oceania
                the undisputed master of the entire world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith. It is to be achieved
            either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of
            power, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search for new weapons continues
            unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive or speculative type of
            mind can find any outlet. In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to
            exist. In Newspeak there is no word for 'Science'. The empirical method of thought, on which all the
            scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of Ingsoc.
            And even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of
            human liberty. In all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards. The fields are
            cultivated with horse&minus;ploughs while books are written by machinery. But in matters of vital importance
            meaning, in effect, war and police espionage the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least
            tolerated. The two</p>

        <p>aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the
            possibility of independent thought. There are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to
            solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, and the other is how
            to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand. In so far as
            scientific research still continues, this is its subject matter. The scientist of today is either a mixture
            of psychologist and inquisitor, studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions,
            gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth&minus;producing effects of drugs, shock therapy,
            hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist, physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches
            of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of life. In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of
            Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the Brazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on
            lost islands of the Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some are concerned simply
            with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more
            powerful explosives, and more and more impenetrable armour&minus; plating; others search for new and
            deadlier gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the
            vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies;
            others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water,
            or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing&minus;ship; others explore even remoter
            possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in
            space, or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earth's centre.</p>

        <p>Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula. But this would violate the principle,
            followed on all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were to conquer the areas
            that used once to be known as France and Germany, it would be necessary either to exterminate the
            inhabitants, a task of great physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million
            people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on the Oceanic level. The problem is the same
            for all three super&minus;states. It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no
            contact with foreigners,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners and coloured slaves. Even the official ally of the moment is
            always regarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the average citizen of Oceania never sets
            eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If
            he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and
            that most of what he has been told about them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken,
            and the fear, hatred, and self&minus;righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate. It is
            therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands,
            the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and acted upon: namely, that the
            conditions of life in all three super&minus;states are very much the same. In Oceania the prevailing
            philosophy is called Ingsoc, in Eurasia it is called Neo&minus;Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is called by a
            Chinese name usually</p>

        <p>Efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed. Nothing is efficient in Oceania except the Thought
            Police. Since each of the three super&minus;states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe
            within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised. Reality only exerts its pressure
            through the needs of everyday life the need to eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid
            swallowing poison or stepping out of top&minus;storey windows, and the like. Between life and death, and
            between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still a distinction, but that is all. Cut off from
            contact with the outer world, and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space,
            who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down. The rulers of such a state are absolute,
            as the Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be. They are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to
            death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of
            military technique as their rivals; but once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever
            shape they choose.</p>

        <p>Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered. The blissful
            feeling of being alone with the forbidden book, in a room with no telescreen, had not worn off. Solitude and
            safety were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body, the softness of the chair,
            the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek. The book fascinated him, or more
            exactly it reassured him. In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction.
            It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It
            was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful, more systematic, less
            fear&minus;ridden. The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already. He had just
            turned back to Chapter I when he heard Julia's footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to meet
            her. She dumped her brown tool&minus;bag on the floor and flung herself into his arms. It was more than a
            week since they had seen one another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I've got <em>the book,'</em> he said as&nbsp; they&nbsp; disentangled&nbsp; themselves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Oh, you've got it? Good,' she said without much interest, and almost immediately knelt down beside the
            oilstove to make the coffee.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an hour. The evening was just cool
            enough to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane. From below came the familiar sound of singing and
            the scrape of boots on the flagstones. The brawny red&minus;armed woman whom Winston had seen there on his
            first visit was almost a fixture in the yard. There seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not</p>

        <p>marching to and fro between the washtub and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and
            breaking forth into lusty song. Julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already on the point of
            falling asleep. He reached out for the book, which was lying on the floor, and sat up against the bedhead.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We&nbsp; must&nbsp; read it,' he said. 'You too. All members of the&nbsp; Brotherhood have to read it.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You read it,' she said with her eyes shut. 'Read it aloud. That's the best way. Then you can explain it to
            me as you go.'</p>

        <p>The clock's hands said six, meaning eighteen. They had three or four hours ahead of them. He propped the book
            against his knees and began reading:</p>

        <p><strong>Chapter I</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Ignorance is Strength</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of
            people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have
            borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another,
            have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous
            upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a
            gyroscope will always return to equilibnum, however far it is pushed one way or the other</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Julia, are you awake?' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, my love, I'm listening. Go on. It's marvellous.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the High. It had been preached by kings and aristocrats
            and by the priests, lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had generally been softened
            by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling
            for power, had always made use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity. Now, however, the concept
            of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command, but merely
            hoped to be so before long. In the past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and
            then had estab lished a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown. The new Middle groups in effect
            proclaimed their tyranny beforehand. Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and
            was the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity, was still
            deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages. But in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about
            1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned. The new
            movements which appeared in the middle years of the century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo&minus;Bolshevism in
            Eurasia, Death&minus;Worship, as it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim of</p>

        <p>kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore,
            from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power, human equality was no
            longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to be averted. In more primitive ages, when a just and
            peaceful society was in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of an earthly
            paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood, without laws and without brute labour,
            had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain hold even on the
            groups who actually profited by each historical change. The heirs of the French, English, and American
            revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality
            before the law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were
            authoritarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realizable.
            Every new political theory, by whatever name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And
            in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which had been long abandoned,
            in some cases</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for hundreds of years imprisonment without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions,
            torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation of whole populations&minus;not only
            became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened
            and progressive.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and counter&minus;revolutions in all
            parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully worked&minus;out political theories. But they
            had been foreshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which had appeared earlier in
            the century, and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been
            obvious. What kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious. The new aristocracy was made

        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, trade&minus;union organizers, publicity experts,
            sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These people, whose origins lay in the
            salaried middle class and the upper grades of the working class, had been shaped and brought together by the
            barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government. As compared with their opposite numbers in
            past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more
            conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition. This last difference was cardinal.
            By comparison with that existing today, all the tyrannies of the past were half&minus;hearted and
            inefficient. The ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to
            leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were
            thinking. Even the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reason
            for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance.
            The invention of print, however, made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio
            carried the process further. With the development of television, and the technical advance which made it
            possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. Every
            citizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching, could be kept for twentyfour hours
            a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of
            communication closed. The possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the State, but
            complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects, now existed for the first time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society regrouped itself, as always, into High,
            Middle, and Low. But the new High group, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what
            was needed to safeguard its position. It had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy is
            collectivism. Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The
            so&minus;called 'abolition of private property' which took place in the middle years of the century meant,
            in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before: but with this difference, that the
            new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the Party owns
            anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the Party owns everything in Oceania, because it
            controls everything, and disposes of the products as it thinks fit. In the years following the Revolution it
            was able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed, because the whole process was represented
            as an act of collectivization. It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were expropriated,
            Socialism must follow: and unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land,
            houses, transport everything had been taken away from them: and since these things were no longer private
            property, it followed that they must be public property. Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier Socialist
            movement and inherited its phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in the Socialist programme;
            with the result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that economic inequality has been made permanent.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this. There are only four ways in
            which a ruling group can fall from power. Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so
            inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group to
            come into being, or it loses its own self&minus;confidence and willingness to govern. These causes do not
            operate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree. A ruling class which could guard
            against all of them would remain in power permanently. Ultimately the determining factor is the mental
            attitude of the ruling class itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality disappeared. Each of the three
            powers which now divide the world is in fact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow
            demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert. The second danger, also, is only a
            theoretical one. The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are
            oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become
            aware that they are oppressed. The recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are
            not now permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocations can and do happen</p>

        <p>inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital. Oceania has no
            capital, and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows. Except that English is its chief
            <em>lingua franca</em> and Newspeak its official language, it is not centralized in any way. Its rulers are
            not held together by blood&minus;ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. It is true that our society is
            stratified, and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>very rigidly stratified, on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines. There is far less to&minus;
            and&minus;fro movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the
            pre&minus;industrial age. Between the two branches of the Party there is a certain amount of interchange,
            but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitious members
            of the Outer Party are made harmless by allowing them to rise. Proletarians, in practice, are not allowed to
            graduate into the Party. The most gifted among them, who might possibly become nuclei of discontent, are
            simply marked down by the Thought Police and eliminated. But this state of affairs is not necessarily
            permanent, nor is it a matter of principle. The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It does
            not aim at transmitting power to its</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>own children, as such; and if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be
            perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat. In the crucial
            years, the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition. The
            older kind of Socialist, who had been trained to fight against something called 'class privilege' assumed
            that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent. He did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not
            be physical, nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived, whereas
            adoptive organizations such as the Catholic Church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years.
            The essence of oligarchical rule is not father&minus;to&minus;son inheritance, but the persistence of a
            certain world&minus;view and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon the living. A ruling group is a ruling group so long as it
                can nominate its successors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with
                perpetuating itself.</li>

        <p><em>Who</em> wields power&nbsp; is not important,&nbsp; provided that the hierarchical&nbsp; structure&nbsp;
            remains&nbsp; always&nbsp; the&nbsp; same.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to
            sustain the mystique of the Party and prevent the true nature of present&minus;day society from being
            perceived. Physical rebellion, or any preliminary move towards rebellion, is at present not possible. From
            the proletarians nothing is to be feared. Left to themselves, they will continue from generation to
            generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without any impulse to rebel,
            but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is. They could only become dangerous
            if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly; but, since military
            and commercial</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>rivalry are no longer&nbsp; important,&nbsp; the&nbsp; level&nbsp; of&nbsp; popu&nbsp; lar education is
            actually declining.&nbsp; What&nbsp; opinions the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>masses hold, or do not hold, is&nbsp; looked&nbsp; on&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; matter&nbsp; of&nbsp;
            indifference.&nbsp; They&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; granted&nbsp; intellectual&nbsp; liberty</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>because they have no intellect. In a Party&nbsp; member,&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand, not even
            the smallest deviation of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>opinion on&nbsp; the most&nbsp; unimportant subject can be tolerated.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the Thought Police. Even when he is alone he can
            never be sure that he is alone. Wherever he may be, asleep or awake, working or resting, in his bath or in
            bed, he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected. Nothing that he
            does is indifferent. His friendships, his relaxations, his behaviour towards his wife and children, the
            expression of his face when he is alone, the words he mutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements of
            his body, are all jealously scrutinized. Not only any actual misdemeanour, but any eccentricity, however
            small, any change of habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle,
            is certain to be detected. He has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever. On the other hand his
            actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour. In Oceania there is no law.
            Thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean certain death are not formally forbidden, and the endless
            purges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which
            have actually been committed, but are merely the wiping&minus;out of persons who might perhaps commit a
            crime at some time in the future. A Party member is required to have not only the right opinions, but the
            right instincts. Many of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated, and could not be stated without laying
            bare the contradictions inherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox (in Newspeak a
            <em>goodthinker),</em> he will in all circumstances know, without taking thought, what is the true belief or
            the desirable emotion. But in any case an elaborate mental training, undergone in childhood and grouping
            itself round the Newspeak words <em>crimestop, blackwhite,</em> and <em>doublethink,</em> makes him
            unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm. He is supposed to
            live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and
            selfabasement before the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents produced by his bare, unsatisfying
            life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes Hate, and the
            speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his
            early acquired inner discipline. The first and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even to
            young children, is called, in Newspeak, <em>crimestop. Crimestop</em> means the faculty of stopping short,
            as though by</p>

        <p>body. Oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is
            infallible. But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is
            need for an unwearying, moment&minus;to&minus;moment flexibility in the treatment of facts. The keyword here
            is <em>blackwhite.</em> Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings.
            Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of
            the plain facts. Applied to a</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But
            it means also the ability to <em>believe</em> that black is white, and more, to <em>know</em> that black is
            white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the
            past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in
            Newspeak as <em>doublethink.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which is subsidiary and, so to speak,
            precautionary. The subsidiary reason is that the Party member, like the proletarian, tolerates
            present&minus;day conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison. He must be cut off from the
            past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is necessary for him to believe that he
            is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising. But by
            far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of
            the Party. It is not merely</p>

        <p>All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or because they grew soft. Either
            they became stupid and arrogant, failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances, and were overthrown;
            or they became liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should have used force, and once again were
            overthrown. They fell, that is to say, either through consciousness or through unconsciousness. It is the
            achievement of the Party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist
            simultaneously. And upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the Party be made permanent. If
            one is to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality. For the secret
            of rulership is to combine a belief in one's own infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes.

        <p>But there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored. It is; <em>why</em> should human
            equality be averted? Supposing that the mechanics of the process have been rightly described, what is the
            motive for this huge, accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here we reach the central secret. As we have seen. the mystique of the Party, and above all of the Inner
            Party, depends upon <em>doublethink.</em> But deeper than this lies the original motive, the
            never&minus;questioned instinct that</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

            Winston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware of a new sound. It seemed to him that Julia had been
            very still for some time past. She was lying on her side, naked from the waist upwards, with her cheek
            pillowed on her</p>

        <p>hand and&nbsp; one&nbsp; dark&nbsp; lock&nbsp; tumbling&nbsp; across her&nbsp; eyes. Her breast rose and
            fell&nbsp; slowly and regularly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Julia.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No answer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Julia, are you awake?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No answer. She was asleep. He shut the book, put it carefully on the floor, lay down, and pulled the coverlet
            over both of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret. He understood <em>how;</em> he did not
            understand <em>why.</em> Chapter I, like Chapter III, had not actually told him anything that he did not
            know, it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already. But after reading it he knew
            better than before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, even a minority of one, did not make you mad.
            There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were
            not mad. A yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell across the pillow. He
            shut his eyes. The sun on his face and the girl's smooth body touching his own gave him a strong, sleepy,
            confident feeling. He was safe, everything was all right. He fell asleep murmuring 'Sanity is not
            statistical,' with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom. When he woke it was with
            the sensation of having slept for a long time, but a glance at the old&minus;fashioned clock told him that
            it was only twenty&minus; thirty. He lay dozing for a while; then the usual deep&minus; lunged singing
            struck up from the yard below;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It was only an 'opeless fancy,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It passed like an Ipril dye,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The driveling song seemed to have kept its popularity. You still heard it all over the place. It had outlived
            the Hate Song. Julia woke at the sound, stretched herself luxuriously, and got out of bed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I'm hungry,' she said. 'Let's make some more coffee. Damn! The stove's gone out and the water's cold.' She
            picked the stove up and shook it. 'There's no oil in it.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We can get some from old Charrington, I expect.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The funny thing is I made sure it was full. I'm going to put my clothes on,' she added. 'It seems to have
            got colder.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston also got up and dressed himself. The indefatigable&nbsp; voice&nbsp; sang on:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'They sye that time 'eals all things,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They sye you can always forget;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They twist my 'eart&minus;strings yet!'</p>

        <p>As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window. The sun must have gone down behind
            the houses; it was not shining into the yard any longer. The flagstones were wet as though they had just
            been washed, and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh and pale was the blue between
            the chimney&minus;pots. Tirelessly the woman marched to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and
            falling silent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. He wondered whether she took in washing
            for a living or was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side;
            together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below. As he looked at the woman in
            her characteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching up for the line, her powerful mare&minus;like buttocks
            protruded, it</p>

        <p>'She's beautiful,' he murmured.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'She's a metre across the hips, easily,' said Julia.</p>

        <p>'That is her style of beauty,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He&nbsp; held Julia's supple waist easily encircled by his arm.&nbsp; From&nbsp; the hip to the knee her
            flank&nbsp; was&nbsp; against&nbsp; his.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Out&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; bodies&nbsp; no child would ever come. That was the one thing&nbsp; they
            could&nbsp; never do. Only by word of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>mouth, from mind to&nbsp; mind,&nbsp; could&nbsp; they&nbsp; pass&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; secret. The woman
            down there had no&nbsp; mind, she had only</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>strong arms, a warm&nbsp; heart,&nbsp; and&nbsp; a&nbsp; fertile&nbsp; belly. He wondered how&nbsp; many
            children she had given birth to. It</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>might easily be fifteen. She&nbsp; had had her momentary flowering, a&nbsp; year,&nbsp; perhaps,&nbsp;
            of&nbsp; wild&minus;rose&nbsp; beauty and then</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>she had suddenly&nbsp; swollen like a fertilized fruit and&nbsp; grown&nbsp; hard&nbsp; and&nbsp; red&nbsp;
            and&nbsp; coarse,&nbsp; and&nbsp; then&nbsp; her&nbsp; life&nbsp; had&nbsp; been</p>

        <p>laundering, scrubbing,&nbsp; darning,&nbsp; cooking,&nbsp; sweeping,&nbsp; polishing,&nbsp; mending,&nbsp;

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>children, then for grandchildren, over thirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still singing. The
            mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale, cloudless sky,
            stretching away behind the chimney&minus;pots into interminable distance. It was curious to think that the
            sky was the same for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky were
            also very much the same everywhere, all over the world, hundreds of thousands of millions of people just
            like this, people ignorant of one another's existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet
            almost exactly the same people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and
            bellies and muscles</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>same solid unconquerable figure, made monstrous by work and childbearing, toiling from birth to death and
            still singing. Out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come. You were the dead,
            theirs was the future. But you could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the
            body, and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We are the dead,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We are the dead,' echoed Julia dutifully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are the dead,' said an iron voice behind them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They sprang apart. Winston's entrails seemed to have turned into ice. He could see the white all round the
            irises of Julia's eyes. Her face had turned a milky yellow. The smear of rouge that was still on each
            cheekbone stood out sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are the dead,' repeated the iron voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It was behind the picture,' breathed Julia.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It was behind the picture,' said the voice. 'Remain exactly where you are. Make no movement until you are
            ordered.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was starting, it was starting at last! They could do nothing except stand gazing into one another's eyes.
            To run for life, to get out of the house before it was too late no such thought occurred to them.
            Unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall. There was a snap as though a catch had been turned
            back, and a crash of breaking glass. The picture had fallen to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind
            it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Now they can see us,' said Julia.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Now we can see you,' said the voice. ' Stand out in the middle of the room. Stand back to back. Clasp
                your hands behind your heads. Do not touch one another.'</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel Julia's body shaking. Or perhaps it was
            merely the shaking of his own. He could just stop his teeth from chattering, but his knees were beyond his
            control. There was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside. The yard seemed to be
            full of men. Something was being dragged across the stones. The woman's singing had stopped abruptly. There
            was a long, rolling clang, as though the washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a confusion of
            angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The house is surrounded,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The house is surrounded,' said the voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He&nbsp; heard Julia snap her teeth together. 'I suppose we may&nbsp; as well&nbsp; say good&minus;bye,' she
            said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You may as well say good&minus;bye,' said the voice.&nbsp; And&nbsp; then&nbsp; another&nbsp; quite&nbsp;
            different voice, a thin, cultivated</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>voice which Winston had the impression of having heard before, struck in; 'And by the way, while we are on
            the subject, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head"!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Something crashed on to the bed behind Winston's back. The head of a ladder had been thrust through the
            window and had burst in the frame. Someone was climbing through the window. There was a stampede of</p>

        <p>boots up the stairs. The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron&minus;shod boots on their
            feet and truncheons in their hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he barely moved. One thing alone mattered; to keep still,
            to keep still and not give them an excuse to hit you ! A man with a smooth prizefighter's jowl in which the
            mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon meditatively between thumb and forefinger.
            Winston met his eyes. The feeling of nakedness, with one's hands behind one's head and one's face and body
            all exposed, was almost unbearable. The man protruded the tip of a white tongue, licked the place where his
            lips should have been, and then passed on. There was another crash. Someone had picked up the glass
            paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearth&minus;stone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake, rolled across the mat. How
            small, thought Winston, how small it always was! There was a gasp and a thump behind him, and he received a
            violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One of the men had smashed his fist into
            Julia's solar plexus, doubling her up like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the floor, fighting
            for breath. Winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre, but sometimes her livid, gasping face came
            within the angle of his vision. Even in his terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body,
            the deadly pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her breath. He knew what it
            was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which was there all the while but could not be suffered yet, because
            before all else it was necessary to be able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her up by knees and
            shoulders,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and carried her out of the room like a sack. Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and
            contorted, with the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that was the last he saw
            of her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He&nbsp; stood&nbsp; dead&nbsp; still.&nbsp; No&nbsp; one had hit him yet. Thoughts&nbsp; which&nbsp; came of
            their own accord but seemed totally</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>uninteresting&nbsp; began to&nbsp; flit through his mind. He wondered&nbsp; whether&nbsp; they&nbsp;
            had&nbsp; got Mr&nbsp; Charrington. He</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>wondered what they had done to the woman&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; yard.&nbsp; He noticed that he badly wanted
            to urinate, and&nbsp; felt a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>faint&nbsp; surprise, because he had done so only two or three&nbsp; hours ago. He&nbsp; noticed that the
            clock on&nbsp; the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>mantelpiece&nbsp; said&nbsp; nine,&nbsp; meaning&nbsp; twenty&minus;one.&nbsp; But&nbsp; the&nbsp; light
            seemed too strong.&nbsp; Would not the light&nbsp; be fading at</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>twenty&minus;one hours on an&nbsp; August&nbsp; evening?&nbsp; He&nbsp; wondered&nbsp; whether&nbsp;
            after&nbsp; all&nbsp; he&nbsp; and&nbsp; Julia had&nbsp; mistaken the time</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>had&nbsp; slept the clock round and&nbsp; thought&nbsp; it&nbsp; was twenty&minus;thirty when really&nbsp; it
            was nought eight&minus;thirty on the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>following&nbsp; morning.&nbsp; But he did not&nbsp; pursue the thought further.&nbsp; It was not interesting.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There ws another, lighter step in the passage. Mr Charrington came into the room. The demeanour of the
            black&minus; uniformed men suddenly became more subdued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington's
            appearance. His eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Pick up those pieces,' he said sharply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disappeared; Winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that
            he had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen. Mr Charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket,
            but his hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was not wearing his spectacles. He gave
            Winston a single sharp glance, as though verifying his identity, and then paid no more attention to him. He
            was still recognizable, but he was not the same person any longer. His body had straightened, and seemed to
            have grown bigger. His face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete
            transformation. The black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the whole lines of the face
            seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It was the alert, cold face of a man of about
            five&minus;and&minus;thirty. It occurred to Winston that for the first time in his life he was looking, with
            knowledge, at a member of the Thought Police.</p>

        <p>He did not know where he was. Presumably he was in the Ministry of Love, but there was no way of making
            certain. He was in a high&minus;ceilinged windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain.
            Concealed lamps flooded it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound which he supposed had
            something to do with the air supply. A bench, or shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall,
            broken only by the door and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden seat. There were
            four telescreens, one in each wall.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever since they had bundled him into the closed van
            and driven him away. But he was also hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be
            twenty&minus;four hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty&minus;six. He still did not know, probably
            never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him. Since he was arrested he
            had not been fed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossed on his knee. He had already learned
            to sit still. If you made unexpected movements they yelled at you from the telescreen. But the craving for
            food was growing upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread. He had an idea that there were
            a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his overalls. It was even possible he thought this because from time to
            time something seemed to tickle his leg that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there. In the end the
            temptation to find out overcame his fear; he slipped a hand into his pocket.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Smith!' yelled a voice from the telescreen.&nbsp; '6079&nbsp; Smith&nbsp; W.!&nbsp; Hands out of pockets in
            the cells!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Before being brought here he had been taken to another
            place which must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary lock&minus;up used by the patrols. He did not
            know how long he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no daylight it was hard to gauge
            the time. It was a noisy, evil&minus;smelling place. They had put him into a cell similar to the one he was
            now in, but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people. The majority of them were
            common criminals, but there were a few political prisoners among them. He had sat silent against the wall,
            jostled by dirty bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much interest in his
            surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing difference in demeanour between the Party prisoners and the
            others. The Party</p>

        <p>and knew the ropes. There was bribery, favouritism, and racketeering of every kind, there was homosexuality

        <p>of white hair which had come down in her struggles, was carried in, kicking and shouting, by four guards, who
            had hold of her one at each corner. They wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them,
            and dumped her down across Winston's lap, almost breaking his thigh&minus;bones. The woman hoisted herself
            upright and followed them out with a yell of 'F bastards!' Then, noticing that she was sitting on something
            uneven, she slid off Winston's knees on to the bench.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Beg pardon, dearie,' she said. 'I wouldn't 'a sat on you, only the buggers put me there. They dono 'ow to
            treat a lady, do they?' She paused, patted her breast, and belched. 'Pardon,' she said, 'I ain't meself,
            quite.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Thass better,' she said, leaning back with closed eyes. 'Never keep it down, thass what I say. Get it up
            while it's fresh on your stomach, like.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She revived, turned to have another look at Winston and seemed immediately to take a fancy to him. She put a
            vast arm round his shoulder and drew him towards her, breathing beer and vomit into his face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Wass your name, dearie?' she said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Smith,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Smith?' said the woman. 'Thass funny. My name's Smith too. Why,' she added sentimentally, 'I might be your
            mother!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was about the right age and physique, and it was probable that
            people changed somewhat after twenty years in a forced&minus;labour camp.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent the ordinary criminals ignored the Party prisoners.
            'The polits,' they called them, with a sort of uninterested contempt. The Party prisoners seemed terrified
            of speaking to anybody, and above all of speaking to one another. Only once, when two Party members, both
            women, were pressed close together on the bench, he overheard amid the din of voices a few
            hurriedly&minus;whispered words; and in particular a reference to something called 'room one&minus;ohone',
            which he did not understand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here. The dull pain in his belly never went
            away, but sometimes it grew better and sometimes worse, and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly.
            When it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for food. When it grew better,
            panic took hold of him. There were moments when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such
            actuality that his heart galloped and his breath stopped. He felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and
            iron&minus;shod boots on his shins; he saw himself grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through
            broken</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>teeth. He hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his mind on her. He loved her and would not betray her;
            but that was only a fact, known as he knew the rules of arithmetic. He felt no love for her, and he hardly
            even wondered what was happening to her. He thought oftener of O'Brien, with a flickering hope. O'Brien
            might know that he had been arrested. The Brotherhood, he had said, never tried to save its members. But
            there was the razor blade; they would send the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps five
            seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The blade would bite into him with a sort of burning
            coldness, and even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone. Everything came back to his sick body,
            which shrank trembling from the smallest pain. He was not certain that he would use the razor blade even if
            he got the chance. It was more natural to exist from moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes' life
            even with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it.</p>

        <p>Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the walls of the cell. It should have been
            easy, but he always lost count at some point or another. More often he wondered where he was, and what time
            of day it was. At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside, and at the next equally
            certain that it was pitch darkness. In this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned
            out. It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why O'Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion. In the
            Ministry of Love there were no windows. His cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer
            wall; it might be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved himself mentally from place to
            place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or buried
            deep underground.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel door opened with a clang. A young officer, a trim
            black&minus; uniformed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished leather, and whose pale,
            straight&minus;featured face was like a wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned to the
            guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. The poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. The
            door clanged shut again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side, as though having some idea that there was
            another door to go out of, and then began to wander up and down the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston's
            presence. His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above the level of Winston's head. He was
            shoeless; large, dirty toes were sticking out of the holes in his socks. He was also several days away from
            a shave. A scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones, giving him an air of ruffianism that went oddly
            with his large weak frame and nervous movements.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston roused hirnself a little from his lethargy. He must speak to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the
            telescreen. It was even conceivable that Ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ampleforth,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth paused, mildly startled. His eyes focused themselves slowly
            on Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ah, Smith!' he said. 'You too!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What are you in for?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'To tell you the truth ' He sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite Winston. 'There is only one offence, is
            there not?' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'And have you committed it?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Apparently I have.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment, as though trying to remember something.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'These things happen,' he began vaguely. 'I have been able to recall one instance a possible instance. It was
            an indiscretion, undoubtedly. We were producing a definitive edition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the
            word "God" to remain at the end of a line. I could not help it!' he added almost indignantly, raising his
            face to look at Winston. 'It was impossible to change the line. The rhyme was "rod". Do you realize that
            there are only twelve rhymes to "rod" in the entire language? For days I had racked my brains. There
            <em>was</em> no other rhyme.'</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The expression on his face changed. The annoyance passed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased.
            A sort of intellectual warmth, the joy of the pedant who has found out some useless fact, shone through the
            dirt and scrubby hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said, 'that the whole history of English poetry has been determined by the
            fact that the English language lacks rhymes?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No, that particular thought had never occurred to Winston. Nor, in the circumstances, did it strike him as
            very important or interesting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Do you know what time of day it is?' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ampleforth&nbsp; looked&nbsp; startled&nbsp; again. 'I had hardly thought&nbsp; about&nbsp; it. They arrested
            me&nbsp;&nbsp; it&nbsp; could&nbsp; be&nbsp; two&nbsp; days&nbsp; ago</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>perhaps three.' His eyes flitted round the walls, as though he half expected to find a window somewhere.
            'There is no difference between night and day in this place. I do not see how one can calculate the time.'
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason, a yell from the telescreen bade them
            be silent. Winston sat quietly, his hands crossed. Ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrow
            bench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one knee, then round the other. The
            telescreen barked at him to keep still. Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour it was difficult to judge. Once
            more</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>there was a sound of boots outside. Winston's entrails contracted. Soon, very soon, perhaps in five minutes,
            perhaps now, the tramp of boots would mean that his own turn had come.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The door opened. The cold&minus;faced young officer stepped into the cell. With a brief movement of the hand
            he indicated Ampleforth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Room 101,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ampleforth&nbsp; marched&nbsp; clumsily&nbsp; out between the guards, his&nbsp; face&nbsp; vaguely perturbed,
            but uncomprehending.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Winston's belly had revived. His mind sagged round and round
            on the same trick, like a ball falling again and again into the same series of slots. He had only six
            thoughts. The pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the screaming; O'Brien ; Julia; the razor
            blade. There was another spasm in his entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. As the door opened, the
            wave of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. Parsons walked into the cell. He was
            wearing khaki shorts and a sports&minus;shirt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This time Winston was startled into self&minus;forgetfulness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>'You</em> here!' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor surprise, but only misery. He began
            walking jerkily up and down, evidently unable to keep still. Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it
            was apparent that they were trembling. His eyes had a wide&minus;open, staring look, as though he could not
            prevent himself from gazing at something in the middle distance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What are you in for?' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Thoughtcrime!'&nbsp; said Parsons, almost blubbering. The tone&nbsp; of his&nbsp; voice implied at once a
            complete admission</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word could be applied to himself. He paused
            opposite Winston and began eagerly appealing to him: 'You don't think they'll shoot me, do you, old chap?
            They don't</p>

        <ul>
            <li>fair hearing. Oh, I trust them for that! They'll know my record, won't they? You know what kind of chap
                I was. Not a bad chap in my way. Not brainy, of course, but keen. I tried to do my best for the Party,
                didn't I? I'll get off with five years, don't you think? Or even ten years? A chap like me could make
                himself pretty useful in a labour&minus;camp. They wouldn't shoot me for going off the rails just once?'
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Are you guilty?' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Of course I'm guilty !' cried Parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen. 'You don't think the Party
            would arrest an innocent man, do you?' His frog&minus;like face grew calmer, and even took on a slightly
            sanctimonious expression. 'Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,' he said sententiously. 'It's
            insidious. It can get hold of you without your even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my
            sleep! Yes, that's a fact. There</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was, working away, trying to do my bit never knew I had any bad stuff in my mind at all. And then I started
            talking in my sleep. Do you know what they heard me saying?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; to utter an obscenity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Down with Big Brother!" Yes, I said that! Said it over and over again, it seems. Between you and me, old
            man, I'm glad they got me before it went any further. Do you know what I'm going to say to them when I go up
            before the tribunal? "Thank you," I'm going to say, "thank you for saving me before it was too late."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Who denounced you?' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It was my little daughter,' said Parsons with a sort of doleful pride. 'She listened at the keyhole. Heard
            what I was saying, and nipped off to the patrols the very next day. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?
            I don't bear her any grudge for it. In fact I'm proud of her. It shows I brought her up in the right spirit,
            anyway.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He made a few more jerky movements up and down, several times, casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan.
            Then he suddenly ripped down his shorts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Excuse me, old man,' he said. 'I can't help it. It's&nbsp; the&nbsp; waiting.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He&nbsp; plumped&nbsp; his&nbsp; large&nbsp; posterior&nbsp; into the lavatory pan.&nbsp; Winston&nbsp;
            covered his face with his hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Smith!' yelled the voice from the telescreen. '6079 Smith W! Uncover your face. No faces covered in the
            cells.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston uncovered his face. Parsons used the lavatory, loudly and abundantly. It then turned out that the
            plug was defective and the cell stank abominably for hours afterwards.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Parsons&nbsp; was&nbsp; removed.&nbsp; More&nbsp; prisoners&nbsp; came&nbsp; and&nbsp; went,&nbsp;
            mysteriously.&nbsp; One,&nbsp; a woman, was consigned to 'Room</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>101', and,&nbsp; Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel and turn a different&nbsp; colour&nbsp; when&nbsp;
            she&nbsp; heard&nbsp; the&nbsp; words.&nbsp; A time</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>came when, if it had been&nbsp; morning&nbsp; when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or&nbsp;
            if&nbsp; it&nbsp; had&nbsp; been</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>afternoon, then it would be midnight. There were&nbsp; six prisoners in the&nbsp; cell, men and women. All
            sat&nbsp; very&nbsp; still.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Opposite&nbsp; Winston&nbsp; there&nbsp; sat a man with a chinless, toothy face&nbsp; exactly like that of
            some&nbsp; large,&nbsp; harmless</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>rodent.&nbsp; His&nbsp; fat,&nbsp; mottled&nbsp; cheeks&nbsp; were&nbsp; so&nbsp; pouched&nbsp; at&nbsp;
            the&nbsp; bottom that it was&nbsp; difficult not to believe that he&nbsp; had</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>little&nbsp; stores&nbsp; of&nbsp; food&nbsp; tucked&nbsp; away&nbsp; there. His pale&minus;grey eyes&nbsp;
            flitted timorously from&nbsp; face to face and turned</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>quickly&nbsp; away&nbsp; again&nbsp; when&nbsp; he&nbsp; caught&nbsp; anyone's eye.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent a momentary chill through Winston.
            He was a commonplace, mean&minus;looking man who might have been an engineer or technician of</p>

        <p>his mouth and nose. A very faint whimpering or squeaking, which seemed unconscious, came out of him. Then he
            rolled over and raised himself unsteadily on hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the two
            halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their knees. The chinless man climbed back into his
            place. Down one side of his face the flesh was darkening. His mouth had swollen into a shapeless
            cherry&minus;coloured mass with a black hole in the middle of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls. His grey eyes still flitted from
            face to face, more guiltily than ever, as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him
            for his humiliation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The&nbsp; door&nbsp; opened.&nbsp; With&nbsp; a&nbsp; small&nbsp; gesture&nbsp; the&nbsp; officer&nbsp;
            indicated the skull&minus;faced man.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Room 101,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston's side. The man had actually flung himself on his knees on the
            floor, with his hand clasped together.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Comrade! Officer!' he cried. 'You don't have to take me to that place! Haven't I told you everything
            already? What else is it you want to know? There's nothing I wouldn't confess, nothing! Just tell me what it
            is and I'll confess straight off. Write it down and I'll sign it anything! Not room 101 !'</p>

        <p>'Room 101,' said the officer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The man's face, already very pale, turned a colour Winston would not have believed possible. It was
            definitely, unmistakably, a shade of green.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Do anything to me!' he yelled. 'You've been starving me for weeks. Finish it off and let me die. Shoot me.
            Hang me. Sentence me to twenty&minus;five years. Is there somebody else you want me to give away? Just say
            who</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>it is and I'll tell you anything you want. I don't care who it is or what you do to them. I've got a wife and
            three children. The biggest of them isn't six years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut their
            throats in front of my eyes, and I'll stand by and watch it. But not Room 101!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Room 101,' said the officer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners, as though with some idea that he could put another
            victim in his own place. His eyes settled on the smashed face of the chinless man. He flung out a lean arm.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'That's the one you ought to be taking, not me!' he shouted. 'You didn't hear what he was saying after they
            bashed his face. Give me a chance and I'll tell you every word of it. <em>He's</em> the one that's against
            the Party, not me.' The guards stepped forward. The man's voice rose to a shriek. 'You didn't hear him!' he
            repeated. 'Something went wrong with the telescreen. <em>He's</em> the one you want. Take him, not me!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms. But just at this moment he flung himself across
            the floor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that supported the bench. He had set up a wordless
            howling, like an animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose, but he clung on with astonishing
            strength. For perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him. The prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed
            on their knees, looking straight in front of them. The howling stopped; the man had no breath left for
            anything except hanging on. Then there was a different kind of cry. A kick from a guard's boot had broken
            the fingers of one of his hands. They dragged him to his feet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Room 101,' said the officer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing his crushed hand, all the fight had gone
            out of him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the skull&minus;faced man was taken away, it was morning: if
            morning, it was afternoon. Winston was alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the
            narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the telescreen. The piece of
            bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look
            at it, but presently hunger gave way to thirst. His mouth was sticky and evil&minus;tasting. The humming
            sound and the unvarying white light induced a sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would
            get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit down again almost at once
            because he was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet. Whenever his physical sensations were a little
            under control the terror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of O'Brien and the razor blade.
            It was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he
            thought of Julia. Somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he. She might be screaming
            with pain at this moment. He thought: 'If I could save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I
            would.' But that</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought to take it. He did not feel it. In
            this place you could not feel anything, except pain and foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible,
            when you were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own pain should increase? But that
            question was not answerable yet.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O'Brien&nbsp; came&nbsp; in.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him. For the first time in
            many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'They've got you too!' he cried.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'They got me a long time ago,' said O'Brien with a mild, almost regretful irony. He stepped aside. from
            behind him there emerged a broad&minus;chested guard with a long black truncheon in his hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You know him, Winston,' said O'Brien. 'Don't deceive yourself. You did know it you have always known it.'
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no time to think of that. All he had eyes for was the
            truncheon in the guard's hand. It might fall anywhere; on the crown, on the tip of the ear, on the upper
            arm, on the elbow&minus;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost paralysed, clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand.
            Everything had exploded into yellow light. Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain!
            The light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him. The guard was laughing at his
            contortions. One question at any rate was answered. Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an
            increase of pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop. Nothing in the world was so
            bad as physical pain. In the face of pain there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he
            writhed on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it was higher off the ground and that he was
            fixed down in some way so that he could not move. Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his
            face. O'Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. At the other side of him stood a man
            in a white coat, holding a hypodermic syringe.</p>

        <p>other&nbsp; questioners saw&nbsp; to&nbsp; it&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; in&nbsp; constant&nbsp;
            slight&nbsp; pain,&nbsp; but&nbsp; it was not chiefly pain that they&nbsp; relied on.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They slapped his&nbsp; face, wrung his&nbsp; ears.&nbsp; pulled&nbsp; his&nbsp; hair,&nbsp; made him stand on
            one leg,&nbsp; refused him leave to</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>urinate,&nbsp; shone glaring lights in his face until&nbsp; his eyes ran with water;&nbsp; but the aim of
            this was simply to</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>humiliate&nbsp; him and destroy his&nbsp; power of arguing and&nbsp; reasoning.&nbsp; Their&nbsp; real&nbsp;
            weapon&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; merciless</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>questioning&nbsp; that&nbsp; went&nbsp; on and on, hour&nbsp; after hour,&nbsp; tripping him up, laying traps
            for him, twisting everything</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that&nbsp; he&nbsp; said,&nbsp; convicting&nbsp; him&nbsp; at&nbsp; every&nbsp; step&nbsp; of&nbsp;
            lies&nbsp; and&nbsp; self&minus;contradiction until he began weeping as much from</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>shame as&nbsp; from&nbsp; nervous fatigue Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times&nbsp; in&nbsp; a&nbsp;
            single&nbsp; session. Most of the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>time they screamed abuse at&nbsp; him and&nbsp; threatened at every hesitation to deliver him&nbsp;
            over&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; guards&nbsp; again;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>but&nbsp; sometimes&nbsp; they would suddenly change&nbsp; their tune, call&nbsp; him comrade, appeal
            to&nbsp; him&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of&nbsp; Ingsoc</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and&nbsp; Big&nbsp; Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even&nbsp; now he had not enough&nbsp; loyalty
            to the Party&nbsp; left&nbsp; to</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>make&nbsp; him&nbsp; wish to undo the evil he had&nbsp; done. When his nerves were in rags&nbsp; after&nbsp;
            hours&nbsp; of questioning, even</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>this appeal could reduce him&nbsp; to snivelling tears. In the end the&nbsp; nagging&nbsp; voices&nbsp;
            broke&nbsp; him&nbsp; down more</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>completely than the boots and&nbsp; fists of the guards. He&nbsp; became&nbsp; simply&nbsp; a&nbsp;
            mouth&nbsp; that&nbsp; uttered,&nbsp; a&nbsp; hand&nbsp; that signed,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was&nbsp; to find&nbsp; out&nbsp; what&nbsp; they&nbsp; wanted
            him to confess, and then</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>confess it&nbsp; quickly,&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp; bullying&nbsp; started&nbsp; anew.&nbsp; He&nbsp;
            confessed&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; assassination&nbsp; of&nbsp; eminent&nbsp; Party</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>members, the distribution of&nbsp; seditious pamphlets, embezzlement&nbsp; of&nbsp; public&nbsp; funds,&nbsp;
            sale&nbsp; of&nbsp; military&nbsp; secrets,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>sabotage of every kind. He confessed that he&nbsp; had&nbsp; been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian&nbsp;
            government&nbsp; as&nbsp; far</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>back as 1968. He confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sexual pervert.
            He confessed that he had murdered his wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his
            wife was still alive. He confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with Goldstein and had been
            a member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known. It
            was easier to confess everything and implicate everybody. Besides, in a sense it was all true. It was true
            that he had been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes of the Party there was no distinction between the
            thought and the deed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were also memories of another kind. They stood out in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with
            blackness all round them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was in a cell which might&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; either&nbsp; dark&nbsp; or&nbsp; light,&nbsp;
            because he could see nothing except a pair of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>eyes. Near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more
            luminous. Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and was swallowed up.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading
            the dials. There was a tramp of heavy boots outside. The door clanged open. The waxed&minus;faced officer
            marched in, followed by two guards.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Room 101,' said the officer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not look at Winston either; he was looking only at the
            dials.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious, golden light, roaring with
            laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice. He was confessing everything, even the things
            he had succeeded in holding back under the torture. He was relating the entire history of his life to an
            audience who knew it already. With him were the guards, the other questioners, the men in white coats,
            O'Brien, Julia, Mr Charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with laughter. Some
            dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over and had not happened.
            Everything was all right, there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare, understood,
            forgiven.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was starting up from the plank bed in the half&minus; certainty that he had heard O'Brien's voice. All
            through his interrogation, although he had never seen him, he had had the feeling that O'Brien was at his
            elbow, just out</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of sight. It was O'Brien who was directing everything. It was he who set the guards on to Winston and who
            prevented them from killing him. It was he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he should
            have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs should be pumped into his arm.
            It was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he
            was the inquisitor, he was the friend. And once Winston could not remember whether it was in drugged sleep,
            or in normal sleep, or even in a moment of wakefulness a voice murmured in his ear: 'Don't worry, Winston;
            you are in my keeping. For seven years I have watched over you. Now the turning&minus;point has come. I
            shall save you, I shall make you perfect.' He was not sure whether it was O'Brien's voice; but it was the
            same voice that had said to him, 'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' in that other
            dream, seven years ago.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He did not remember any ending to his interrogation. There was a period of blackness and then the cell, or
            room, in which he now was had gradually materialized round him. He was almost flat on his back, and unable
            to move. His body was held down at every essential point. Even the back of his head was gripped in some
            manner. O'Brien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse
            and worn, with pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older than Winston had
            thought him; he was perhaps forty&minus;eight or fifty. Under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top
            and figures running round the face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I told you,' said O'Brien, 'that if we met again it would&nbsp; be&nbsp; here.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Without any warning except a slight movement of O'Brien's hand, a wave of pain flooded his body. It was a
            frightening pain, because he could not see what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal
            injury was being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening, or whether the effect
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was electrically produced ; but his body was being wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn
            apart. Although the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was the fear that his
            backbone was about to snap. He set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as
            long as possible.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are afraid,' said O'Brien, watching his face, 'that in another moment something is going to break. Your
            especial fear is that it will be your backbone. You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping
            apart and the spinal fluid dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking, is it not, Winston?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston did not answer. O'Brien drew back the lever on the dial. The wave of pain receded almost as quickly
            as it had come.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'That was forty,' said O'Brien. 'You can see that the numbers on this dial run up to a hundred. Will you
            please remember, throughout our conversation, that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any
            moment and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>to whatever degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt to prevaricate in any way, or even fall
            below your usual level of intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you understand that?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien's manner became less severe. He resettled his spectacles thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and
            down. When he spoke his voice was gentle and patient. He had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a priest,
            anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I am taking trouble with you, Winston,' he said, 'because you are worth trouble. You know perfectly well
            what is the matter with you. You have known it for years, though you have fought against the knowledge. You
            are mentally deranged. You suffer from a defective memory. You are unable to remember real events and you
            persuade yourself that you remember other events which never happened. Fortunately it is curable. You have
            never cured yourself of it, because you did not choose to. There was a small effort of the will that you
            were not ready to make. Even now, I am well aware, you are clinging to your disease under the impression
            that it is a virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment, which power is Oceania at war with?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'With&nbsp; Eastasia.&nbsp; Good. And Oceania has always been at war&nbsp; with&nbsp; Eastasia, has it not?'
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to speak and then did not speak. He could not take his eyes
            away from the dial.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The truth, please, Winston. <em>Your</em> truth.&nbsp; Tell&nbsp; me&nbsp; what you&nbsp; think you
            remember.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I remember that until only a week before I was arrested, we were not at war with Eastasia at all. We were in
            alliance with them. The war was against Eurasia. That had lasted for four years. Before that '</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Another example,' he said. 'Some years ago you had a very serious delusion indeed. You believed that three
            men, three onetime Party members named Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford men who were executed for treachery
            and sabotage after making the fullest possible confession were not guilty of the crimes they were charged
            with. You believed that you had seen unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were
            false. There was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination. You believed that you had
            actually held it in your hands. It was a photograph something like this.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien's fingers. For perhaps five seconds it was within
            the angle of Winston's vision. It was a photograph, and there was no question of its identity. It was
            <em>the</em> photograph. It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford at the
            party</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>function in New York, which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. For only an instant
            it was before his eyes, then it was out of sight again. But he had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it!
            He made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so
            much as a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he had even forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to
            hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at least to see it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It exists!' he cried.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No,' said O'Brien.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole in the opposite wall. O'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen,
            the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame.
            O'Brien turned away from the wall.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ashes,'&nbsp; he&nbsp; said. 'Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It&nbsp; does&nbsp; not exist. It never
            existed.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in&nbsp; memory.&nbsp; I&nbsp; remember it. You remember it.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston's heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a feeling of deadly helplessness. If he could have been
            certain that O'Brien was lying, it would not have seemed to matter. But it was perfectly possible that
            O'Brien had really forgotten the photograph. And if so, then already he would have forgotten his denial of
            remembering it, and forgotten the act of forgetting. How could one be sure that it was simple trickery?
            Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the thought that defeated him.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien was looking down at him speculatively. More than ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a
            wayward but promising child.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'There&nbsp; is&nbsp; a Party slogan dealing with the control of the&nbsp; past,'&nbsp; he said. 'Repeat it,
            if you please.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past," repeated Winston
            obediently.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Who controls the present controls the past," said O'Brien, nodding his head with slow approval. 'Is it your
            opinion, Winston, that the past has real existence?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston. His eyes flitted towards the dial. He not only did
            not know whether 'yes' or 'no' was the answer that would save him from pain; he did not even know which
            answer he believed to be the true one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien smiled faintly. 'You are no metaphysician, Winston,' he said. 'Until this moment you had never
            considered what is meant by existence. I will put it more precisely. Does the past exist concretely, in
            space? Is there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past is still happening?'
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Then where does the past exist, if at all?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'In records. It is written down.'</p>

        <p>'In records. And&minus; ?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'In the mind. In human memories.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all records, and we control all memories. Then we control
            the past, do we not?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'But how can you stop people remembering things?' cried Winston again momentarily forgetting the dial. 'It is
            involuntary. It is outside oneself. How can you control memory? You have not controlled mine!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien's manner grew stern again. He laid his hand on the&nbsp; dial.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'On the contrary,' he said, <em>'you</em> have not controlled it. That is what has brought you here. You are
            here because you have failed in humility, in self&minus; discipline. You would not make the act of
            submission which is the price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only the
            disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality is something objective, external,
            existing in its own right. You also believe that the nature of reality is self&minus;evident. When you
            delude yourself into thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as
            you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external. Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere
            else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the
            Party holds to be the truth, <em>is</em> truth. It is impossible to see reality except by looking through
            the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that you have got to relearn, Winston. It needs an act of
            self&minus; destruction, an effort of the will. You must humble yourself before you can become sane.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He&nbsp; paused&nbsp; for&nbsp; a few moments, as though to allow what he&nbsp; had&nbsp; been saying to sink
            in.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Do you remember,' he went on, ' writing in your diary, "Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make
            four"?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien&nbsp; held&nbsp; up his left hand, its back towards Winston,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the thumb hidden and
            the four fingers extended.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Four.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'And if the party says that it is not&nbsp; four&nbsp; but&nbsp; five&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then&nbsp; how
            many?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Four.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The&nbsp; word&nbsp; ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial&nbsp; had&nbsp; shot up to
            fifty&minus;five. The sweat had sprung&nbsp; out</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>all over Winston's body. The air tore into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching
            his teeth he could not stop. O'Brien watched him, the four fingers still extended. He drew back the lever.
            This time the pain was only slightly eased.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'How many fingers, Winston?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Four.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The needle went up to sixty.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The needle must have risen again, but he did not look at it. The heavy, stern face and the four fingers
            filled his vision. The fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to
            vibrate, but unmistakably four.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'How many fingers, Winston?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'How many fingers, Winston?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Five! Five! Five!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No, Winston, that is no use. You&nbsp; are&nbsp; lying.&nbsp; You&nbsp; still&nbsp; think&nbsp; there are
            four. How many fingers, please?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Four!&nbsp; five!&nbsp; Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop&nbsp; the&nbsp; pain!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Abruptly he was sitting up with O'Brien's arm round his shoulders. He had perhaps lost consciousness for a
            few seconds. The bonds that had held his body down were loosened. He felt very cold, he was shaking
            uncontrollably, his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. For a moment he clung to
            O'Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy arm round his shoulders. He had the feeling that
            O'Brien was his protector, that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source, and
            that it was O'Brien who would save him from it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are a slow learner, Winston,' said O'Brien gently.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'How can I help it?' he blubbered. 'How can I help&nbsp; seeing&nbsp; what is&nbsp; in front of my eyes? Two
            and two are four.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at
            once. You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He laid Winston down on the bed. The grip of his limbs tightened again, but the pain had ebbed away and the
            trembling had stopped, leaving him merely weak and cold. O'Brien motioned with his head to the man in the
            white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. The man in the white coat bent down and
            looked closely into Winston's eyes, felt his pulse, laid an ear against his chest, tapped here and there,
            then he nodded to O'Brien.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Again,' said O'Brien.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The pain flowed into Winston's body. The needle must be at seventy, seventy&minus;five. He had shut his eyes
            this time. He knew that the fingers were still there, and still four. All that mattered was somehow to stay
            alive until the spasm was over. He had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not. The pain lessened
            again. He opened his eyes. O'Brien had drawn back the lever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'How many fingers, Winston?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Four. I suppose there are four. I would&nbsp; see&nbsp; five&nbsp; if&nbsp; I&nbsp; could.&nbsp; I am trying
            to see five.'</p>

        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Which&nbsp; do&nbsp; you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or&nbsp; really&nbsp; to see them?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Really to see them.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Again,' said O'Brien.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps the needle was eighty ninety. Winston could not intermittently remember why the pain was happening.
            Behind his screwed&minus;up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in
            and out, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again. He was trying to count them, he could not
            remember why. He knew only that it was impossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the
            mysterious identity between five and four. The pain died down again. When he opened his eyes it was to find
            that he was still seeing the same thing. Innumerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streaming past
            in either direction, crossing and recrossing. He shut his eyes again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I don't know. I don't know. You will kill me if you do that again. Four, five, six in all honesty I don't
            know.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Better,' said O'Brien.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>needle slid into Winston's arm. Almost in the same instant a blissful, healing warmth spread all through
                his body. The pain was already half&minus;forgotten. He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at
                O'Brien. At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart seemed to turn over.
                If he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand and laid it on O'Brien arm. He had never loved
                him so deeply as at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain. The old feeling, that
                it bottom it did not matter whether O'Brien was a friend or an enemy, had come back. O'Brien was a
                person who could be talked to. Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. O'Brien
                had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was certain, he would send him to his
                death. It made no difference. In some sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates:
                somewhere or other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place where they could
                meet and talk. O'Brien was looking down at him with an expression which suggested that the same thought
                might be in his own mind. When he spoke it was</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>in an easy, conversational tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Do you know where you are, Winston?' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I don't know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Do you know how long you have been here?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I don't know. Days,&nbsp; weeks,&nbsp; months&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; think&nbsp; it&nbsp;
            is&nbsp; months.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'And&nbsp; why&nbsp; do&nbsp; you&nbsp; imagine&nbsp; that&nbsp; we bring people to this&nbsp; place?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'To make them confess.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No, that is not the reason. Try again.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No!' exclaimed O'Brien. His voice had changed extraordinarily, and his face had suddenly become both stern
            and animated. 'No! Not merely to extract your confession, not to punish you. Shall I tell you why we have
            brought you here? To cure you ! To make you sane ! Will you understand, Winston, that no one whom we bring
            to this place ever leaves our hands uncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have
            committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about. We do not merely
            destroy our enemies, we change them. Do you understand what I mean by that?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was bending over&nbsp; Winston.&nbsp; His&nbsp; face&nbsp; looked&nbsp; enormous&nbsp; because&nbsp; of
            its nearness, and hideously ugly because</p>

        <p>were despicable, cringing wretches, confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with
            abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy. And yet after only a few years the
            same thing had happened over again. The dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten.
            Once again, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that they had made were obviously
            extorted and untrue. We do not make mistakes of that kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are
            true. We make them true. And above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us. You must stop
            imagining</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that posterity will vindicate you, Winston. Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out
            from the stream of history. We shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere. Nothing will
            remain of you, not a name in a register, not a memory in a living brain. You will be annihilated in the past
            as well as i the future. You will never have existed.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a momentary bitterness. O'Brien checked his step as
            though Winston had uttered the thought aloud. His large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little
            narrowed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are thinking,' he said, 'that since we intend to destroy you utterly, so that nothing that you say or do
            can make the smallest difference in that case, why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first? That
            is what you were thinking, was it not?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien smiled slightly. 'You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You are a stain that must be wiped out. Did
            I not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the past? We are not content with
            negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission. When finally you surrender to us, it must be
            of your own free will. We do not destroy the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we
            never destroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him. We burn all evil and all
            illusion out of him; we bring him over to our side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We
            make him one of</p>

        <p>His voice had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm, was still in his face. He is not
            pretending, thought Winston, he is not a hypocrite, he believes every word he says. What most oppressed him
            was the consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. He watched the heavy yet graceful form strolling
            to and fro, in and out of the range of his vision. O'Brien was a being in all ways larger than himself.
            There was</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>no idea that he had ever had, or could have, that O'Brien had not long ago known, examined, and rejected. His
            mind <em>contained</em> Winston's mind. But in that case how could it be true that O'Brien was mad? It must
            be he, Winston, who was mad. O'Brien halted and looked down at him. His voice had grown stern again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, however completely you surrender to us. No one who has
            once gone astray is ever spared. And even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life,
            still you would never escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever. Understand that in advance. We
            shal crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back. Things will happen to you from which
            you</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>could not recover, if you lived a thousand years. Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling.
            Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of
            living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty,
            and then we shall fill you with ourselves.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He paused and signed to the man in the white coat. Winston&nbsp; was&nbsp; aware of some heavy piece of
            apparatus</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>being pushed into place behind his head. O'Brien had sat down beside the bed, so that his face was almost on
            a level with Winston's.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Three thousand,' he said, speaking over Winston's head to&nbsp; the man&nbsp; in the white coat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Two soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped themselves against Winston's temples. He quailed. There was
            pain coming, a new kind of pain. O'Brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'This&nbsp; time&nbsp; it&nbsp; will&nbsp; not hurt,' he said. 'Keep your eyes&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; on mine.'
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what seemed like an explosion, though it was not certain
            whether there was any noise. There was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light. Winston was not hurt, only
            prostrated. Although he had already been lying on his back when the thing happened, he had a curious feeling
            that he had been knocked into that position. A terrific painless blow had flattened him out. Also something
            had happened inside his head. As his eyes regained their focus he remembered who he was, and where he was,
            and recognized the face that was gazing into his own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of
            emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his brain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It will not last,' said O'Brien. 'Look me&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; eyes.&nbsp; What&nbsp; country is Oceania
            at war with?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston thought. He knew what was meant by Oceania and that he himself was a citizen of Oceania. He also
            remembered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who was at war with whom he did not know. In fact he had not been aware
            that there was any war.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I don't remember.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Oceania is at war with Eastasia.&nbsp; Do&nbsp; you&nbsp; remember&nbsp; that&nbsp; now?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Since the beginning of your life, since the beginning of the
            Party, since the beginning of history, the war has continued without a break, always the same war. Do you
            remember that?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been condemned to death for treachery. You
                pretended that you had seen a piece of paper which proved them innocent. No such piece of paper ever
                existed. You invented it, and later you grew to believe in it. You remember now the very moment at which
                you first invented it. Do you remember that?'</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Just now I held up the fingers of my hand to you. You saw&nbsp; five&nbsp; fingers. Do you remember that?'
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien&nbsp; held&nbsp; up&nbsp; the&nbsp; fingers of his left hand, with the&nbsp; thumb&nbsp; concealed.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'There are five fingers there. Do you see five fingers?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before the scenery of his mind changed. He saw five fingers, and
            there was no deformity. Then everything was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and the bewilderment
            came crowding back again. But there had been a moment he did not know how long, thirty seconds,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>perhaps of luminous certainty, when each new suggestion of O'Brien's had filled up a patch of emptiness and
            become absolute truth, and when two and two could have been three as easily as five, if that were what was
            needed. It had faded but before O'Brien had dropped his hand; but though he could not recapture it, he could
            remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience at some period of one's life when one was in effect a
            different person.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You see now,' said O'Brien,&nbsp; 'that&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; at&nbsp; any&nbsp; rate&nbsp; possible.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes,' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien stood up with a satisfied air. Over to his left Winston saw the man in the white coat break an
            ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe. O'Brien turned to Winston with a smile. In almost the old
            manner he resettled his spectacles on his nose.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Do you remember writing in your diary,' he said, 'that it did not matter whether I was a friend or an enemy,
            since I was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to? You were right. I enjoy talking to
            you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane. Before we bring
            the session to an end you can ask me a few questions, if you choose.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Any question I like?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Anything.' He saw that Winston's eyes were upon the dial.&nbsp; 'It is&nbsp; switched off. What is your
            first question?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What have you done with Julia?' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien smiled again. 'She betrayed you, Winston. Immediately&minus;unreservedly. I have seldom seen anyone
            come over to us so promptly. You would hardly recognize her if you saw her. All her rebelliousness, her
            deceit, her folly, her dirty&minus;mindedness everything has been burned out of her. It was a perfect
            conversion, a textbook case.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You tortured her?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien left this unanswered. 'Next question,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Does Big Brother exist?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is the&nbsp; embodiment of the Party.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Does he exist in the same way as I exist?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You do not exist,' said O'Brien.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. He knew, or he could imagine, the arguments which proved
            his own nonexistence; but they were nonsense, they were only a play on words. Did not the statement, 'You do
            not exist', contain a logical absurdity? But what use was it to say so? His mind shrivelled as he thought of
            the unanswerable, mad arguments with which O'Brien would demolish him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I think I exist,' he said wearily. 'I am conscious of my own identity. I was born and I shall die. I have
            arms and legs. I occupy a particular point in space. No other solid object can occupy the same point
            simultaneously. In that sense, does Big Brother exist?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It is of no importance. He exists.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Will Big Brother ever die?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Of course not. How could he die? Next question.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Does the Brotherhood exist?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'That, Winston, you will never know. If we choose to set you free when we have finished with you, and if you
            live to be ninety years old, still you will never learn whether the answer to that question is Yes or No. As
            long as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston lay silent. His breast&nbsp; rose&nbsp; and&nbsp; fell&nbsp; a&nbsp; little&nbsp; faster.&nbsp; He
            still had not asked the question that had come</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>into&nbsp; his mind the&nbsp; first. He had got to ask it, and&nbsp; yet&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; as&nbsp;
            though&nbsp; his&nbsp; tongue&nbsp; would&nbsp; not&nbsp; utter it. There was a</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>trace of amusement in O'Brien's face. Even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical gleam. He knows, thought
            Winston suddenly, he knows what I am going to ask! At the thought the words burst out of him:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What is in Room 101?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The&nbsp; expression&nbsp; on&nbsp; O'Brien's&nbsp; face&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; change. He&nbsp; answered
            drily:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You know what is in Room&nbsp; 101,&nbsp; Winston.&nbsp; Everyone&nbsp; knows&nbsp; what is&nbsp; in Room
            101.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He raised a finger to the man in the white coat. Evidently the session was at an end. A needle jerked into
            Winston's arm. He sank almost instantly into deep sleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'There are three stages in your reintegration,' said O'Brien. 'There is learning, there is understanding, and
            there is acceptance. It is time for you to enter upon the second stage.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late&nbsp; his&nbsp; bonds&nbsp; were&nbsp; looser.
            They still held him to the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>bed, but he&nbsp; could move&nbsp; his knees a little and could turn his head from side&nbsp; to side and
            raise&nbsp; his arms from the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>elbow. The dial, also,&nbsp; had&nbsp; grown&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; less of a&nbsp; terror. He could evade
            its pangs if he&nbsp; was&nbsp; quick&minus;witted</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>enough:&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; chiefly&nbsp; when&nbsp; he&nbsp; showed&nbsp; stupidity&nbsp; that&nbsp;
            O'Brien&nbsp; pulled&nbsp; the&nbsp; lever. Sometimes they got&nbsp; through a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>whole session without use of the&nbsp; dial. He&nbsp; could&nbsp; not&nbsp; remember&nbsp; how&nbsp;
            many&nbsp; sessions there had been. The&nbsp; whole</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>process&nbsp; seemed to stretch out over a long, indefinite&nbsp; time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weeks,&nbsp;

        <p>sessions&nbsp; might&nbsp; sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'As you lie there,' said O'Brien, 'you have often wondered you have even asked me why the Ministry of Love
            should expend so much time and trouble on you. And when you were free you were puzzled by what was
            essentially the same question. You could grasp the mechanics of the Society you lived in, but not its
            underlying motives. Do you remember writing in your diary, "I understand <em>how</em> : I do not understand
            why"?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was when you thought about "why" that you doubted your own sanity. You have read the <em>book,</em>
            Goldstein's book, or parts of it, at least. Did it tell you anything that you did not know already?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You have read it?' said Winston.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I wrote it. That is to say, I collaborated in writing it.&nbsp; No book&nbsp; is produced individually, as
            you know.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Is it true, what it says?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'A description, yes. The programme it sets forth is nonsense. The secret accumulation of knowledge a gradual
            spread of enlightenment ultimately a proletarian rebellion the overthrow of the Party. You</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>foresaw yourself that that was what it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians will never revolt, not
            in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I do not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If
            you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. There is no way in which
            the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is for ever. Make that the starting&minus;point of your
            thoughts.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He came closer to the bed. 'For ever!' he repeated. 'And now let us get back to the question of "how" and
            "why". You understand well enough <em>how</em> the Party maintains itself in power. Now tell me why we cling
            to power. What is our motive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak,' he added as Winston remained silent.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two. A feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him. The
            faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back into O'Brien's face. He knew in advance what O'Brien would say.
            That the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of the majority. That it sought
            power because men in the mass were frail cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth,
            and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves. That the
            choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was
            better. That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of others. The terrible thing, thought
            Winston, the terrible thing was that when O'Brien said this he would believe it. You could see it in his
            face. O'Brien knew everything. A thousand times better than Winston he knew what the world was really like,
            in</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept them there.
            He had understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was justified by the ultimate
            purpose. What can you do, thought Winston, against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who
            gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are ruling over us for our own good,' he said feebly. 'You believe that human beings are not fit to
            govern themselves, and therefore&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shot through his body. O'Brien had pushed the lever of
            the dial up to thirty&minus;five.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'That was stupid, Winston, stupid!' he said.&nbsp; 'You&nbsp; should&nbsp; know&nbsp; better than to say a
            thing like that.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He pulled the lever back and continued:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake.
            We are not interested in the good of others ; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or
            long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are
            different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even
            those who resembled ourselves, were&minus; cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian
            Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own
            motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a
            limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and
            equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.
            Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a
            revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is
            persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand
            me?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the tiredness of O'Brien's face. It was strong and
            fleshy and brutal, it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself
            helpless; but it was tired. There were pouches under the eyes, the skin sagged from the cheekbones. O'Brien
            leaned over him, deliberately bringing the worn face nearer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are thinking,' he said, 'that my face is old and tired. You are thinking that I talk of power, and yet I
            am not even able to prevent the decay of my own body. Can you not understand, Winston, that the individual
            is only a cell? The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism. Do you die when you cut your
            fingernails?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He&nbsp; turned&nbsp; away&nbsp; from&nbsp; the bed and began strolling up and&nbsp; down&nbsp; again, one
            hand in his pocket.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We are the priests of power,' he said. 'God is power. But at present power is only a word so far as you are
            concerned. It is time for you to gather some idea of what power means. The first thing you must realize is
            that power is collective. The individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual. You know
            the Party slogan: "Freedom is Slavery". Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery is
            freedom.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alone free the human being is always defeated. It must be so, because every human being is doomed to die,
            which is the greatest of all failures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape from
            his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he <em>is</em> the Party, then he is
            all&minus;powerful and immortal. The second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human
            beings. Over the body but, above all, over the mind. Power over matter external reality, as you would call
            it is not important. Already our control over matter is absolute.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position, and
            merely succeeded in wrenching his body painfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'But how can you control matter?' he burst out. 'You don't even control the climate or the law of gravity.
            And there are disease, pain, death&minus;'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. 'We control matter because we control the mind. Reality is
            inside the skull. You will learn by degrees, Winston. There is nothing that we could not do. Invisibility,
            levitation anything. I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to. I do not wish to, because
            the Party does not wish it. You must get rid of those nineteenth&minus;century ideas about the laws of
            Nature. We make the laws of Nature.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. What about Eurasia and Eastasia? You have not
            conquered them yet.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. And if we did not, what difference would it make? We
            can shut them out of existence. Oceania is the world.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is tiny helpless! How long has he been in existence?
            For millions of years the earth was uninhabited.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older? Nothing exists except through
            human consciousness.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which
            lived here long before man was ever heard of.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Have you ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not. Nineteenth&minus;century biologists invented them.
            Before man there was nothing. After man, if he could come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man
            there is nothing.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars ! Some of them are a million light&minus;years away.
            They are out of our reach for ever.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What are the stars?' said O'Brien indifferently. 'They are bits of fire a few kilometres away. We could
            reach them if we wanted to. Or we could blot them out. The earth is the centre of the universe. The sun and
            the stars go round it.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he did not say anything. O'Brien continued as though
            answering a spoken objection:</p>

        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When we navigate the ocean, or when we predict an
            eclipse, we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are
            millions upon millions of kilometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual
            system of astronomy? The stars can be near or distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose our
            mathematicians are unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he
            knew, he <em>knew,</em> that he was in the right. The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind
            surely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it not been exposed long ago as a
            fallacy? There was even a name for it, which he had forgotten. A faint smile twitched the corners of
            O'Brien's mouth as he looked down at him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I told you, Winston,' he said, 'that metaphysics is not your strong point. The word you are trying to think
            of is solipsism. But you are mistaken. This is not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. But that is
            a different thing: in fact, the opposite thing. All this is a digression,' he added in a different tone.
            'The real power, the power we have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men.' He
            paused, and for a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil: 'How does one man assert his
            power over another, Winston?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston thought. 'By making him suffer,' he said.</p>

        <p>upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self&minus; abasement.
            Everything else we shall destroy everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have
            survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and
            man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the
            future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one
            takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the
            renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will
            be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother.
            There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no
            literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no
            distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.
            All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always do not forget this, Winston always there will be the
            intoxication</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the
            thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the
            future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face for ever.'</p>

        <p>He paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the
            bed again. He could not say anything. His heart seemed to be frozen. O'Brien went on:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'And remember that it is for ever. The face will always be there to be stamped upon. The heretic, the enemy
            of society, will always be there, so that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that you
            have undergone since you have been in our hands all that will continue, and worse. The espionage, the

        <p>terror as much as a world of triumph. The more the Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant: the
            weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism. Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day,
            at every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon and yet they will always survive.
            This drama that I have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again
            generation after generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy,
            screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible and in the end utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling
            to our feet of his own accord. That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world of victory after
            victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of
            power. You are beginning, I can see, to realize what that world will be like. But in the end you will do
            more than understand it. You will accept it, welcome it, become part of it.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak.&nbsp; 'You&nbsp; can't!'&nbsp; he said weakly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What do you mean by that remark, Winston?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You&nbsp; could&nbsp; not&nbsp; create&nbsp; such&nbsp; a&nbsp; world&nbsp; as you have just&nbsp;
            described. It is a dream. It is impossible.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Why?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It is impossible to found&nbsp; a&nbsp; civilization&nbsp; on&nbsp; fear&nbsp; and&nbsp; hatred&nbsp; and
            cruelty. It would never endure.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Why not?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It&nbsp; would&nbsp; have&nbsp; no&nbsp; vitality.&nbsp; It would disintegrate. It&nbsp; would&nbsp; commit
            suicide.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Nonsense. You are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting than love. Why should it be? And if it
            were, what difference would that make? Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster. Suppose that</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>we quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. Still what difference would it make? Can
            you not understand that the death of the individual is not death? The party is immortal.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As usual, the voice had battered Winston into helplessness. Moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in
            his disagreement O'Brien would twist the dial again. And yet he could not keep silent. Feebly, without
            arguments, with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what O'Brien had said, he returned
            to the attack.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't&nbsp; care.&nbsp; Somehow&nbsp; you&nbsp; will&nbsp; fail.&nbsp; Something
            will defeat you. Life will defeat you.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We control life, Winston, at all its levels. You are imagining that there is something called human nature
            which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are
            infinitely malleable. Or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves will
            arise and overthrow us. Put it out of your mind. They are helpless, like the animals. Humanity is the Party.
            The others are outside irrelevant.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I don't care. In the end they will beat you. Sooner or later they will see you for what you are, and then
            they will tear you to pieces.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Do&nbsp; you&nbsp; see&nbsp; any evidence that that is happening? Or any&nbsp; reason&nbsp; why it should?'
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No. I believe it. I <em>know</em> that you will fail. There is something in the universe I don't know, some
            spirit, some principle that you will never overcome.'</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Your kind is extinct; we are the inheritors. Do you
            understand that you are <em>alone?</em> You are outside history, you are non&minus;existent.' His manner
            changed and he said more harshly: 'And you consider yourself morally superior to us, with our lies and our
            cruelty?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes, I consider myself superior.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien did not speak. Two other voices were speaking. After a moment Winston recognized one of them as his
            own. It was a sound&minus;track of the conversation he had had with O'Brien, on the night when he had
            enrolled himself in the Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal, to forge, to murder, to
            encourage drug&minus;taking and prostitution, to disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a
            child's face. O'Brien made a small impatient gesture, as though to say that the demonstration was hardly
            worth making. Then he turned a switch and the voices stopped.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Get up from that bed,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The bonds had loosened themselves. Winston lowered himself&nbsp; to the&nbsp; floor and stood up unsteadily.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are the last man,' said O'Brien. 'You are the guardian of the human spirit. You shall see yourself as
            you are. Take off your clothes.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together. The zip fastener had long since been
            wrenched out of them. He could not remember whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his
            clothes at one time. Beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags, just recognizable
            as the remnants of underclothes. As he slid them to the ground he saw that there was a three&minus;sided
            mirror at the far end of the room. He approached it, then stopped short. An involuntary cry had broken out
            of him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Go on,' said O'Brien. 'Stand between&nbsp; the&nbsp; wings&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; mirror.&nbsp; You shall
            see the side view as well.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, greycoloured, skeleton&minus;like thing was coming towards
            him. Its actual appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. He moved
            closer to the glass. The creature's face seemed to be protruded, because of its bent carriage. A forlorn,
            jailbird's face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and
            battered&minus;looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful. The cheeks were seamed, the
            mouth had a drawn&minus;in look. Certainly it was his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed
            more than he had changed inside. The emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt. He had
            gone partially bald. For the first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the
            scalp that was grey. Except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey all over with ancient,
            ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the
            varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly frightening thing was
            the emaciation of his</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Look at the condition you are in!' he said. 'Look at this filthy grime all over your body. Look at the dirt
            between your toes. Look at that disgusting running sore on your leg. Do you know that you stink like a goat?
            Probably you have ceased to notice it. Look at your emaciation. Do you see? I can make my thumb and
            forefinger meet round your bicep. I could snap your neck like a carrot. Do you know that you have lost
            twenty&minus;five kilograms since you have been in our hands? Even your hair is coming out in handfuls.
            Look!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He plucked at Winston's head and brought away a tuft of hair. 'Open your mouth. Nine, ten, eleven teeth left.

            shot through Winston's jaw. O'Brien had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across the
            cell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are rotting away,' he said; 'you are falling to pieces. What are you? A bag of filth. Now turn around
            and look into that mirror again. Do you see that thing facing you? That is the last man. If you are human,
            that is humanity. Now put your clothes on again.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements. Until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and
            weak he was. Only one thought stirred in his mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had
            imagined. Then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruined body
            overcame him. Before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the
            bed and burst into tears. He was aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of bones in filthy
            underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: but he could not stop himself. O'Brien laid a hand on
            his shoulder, almost kindly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It will not last for ever,' he said. 'You can escape from it whenever you choose. Everything depends on
            yourself.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You&nbsp; did&nbsp; it!'&nbsp; sobbed&nbsp; Winston.&nbsp; 'You reduced me to this&nbsp; state.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what you accepted when you set yourself up against the
            Party. It was all contained in that first act. Nothing has happened that you did not foresee.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He paused, and then went on:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. You have seen what your body is like. Your mind is in
            the same state. I do not think there can be much pride left in you. You have been kicked and flogged and
            insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit. You have
            whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed everybody and everything. Can you think of a single degradation that
            has not happened to you?'</p>

        <p>Winston&nbsp; had&nbsp; stopped weeping, though the tears were still&nbsp; oozing&nbsp; out of his eyes. He
            looked up at O'Brien.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I have not betrayed Julia,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. 'No,' he said; 'no; that is perfectly true. You have not betrayed
            Julia.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The peculiar reverence for O'Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy, flooded Winston's heart again. How
            intelligent, he thought, how intelligent! Never did O'Brien fail to understand what was said to him. Anyone
            else on earth would have answered promptly that he <em>had</em> betrayed Julia. For what was there that they
            had not screwed out of him under the torture? He had told them everything he knew about her, her habits, her
            character, her past life; he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their
            meetings, all that he had said to her and she to him, their black&minus;market meals, their adulteries,
            their vague plottings against the Party everything. And yet, in the sense in which he intended the word, he
            had not betrayed her. He had not stopped loving her; his feelings towards her had remained the same. O'Brien
            had seen what he meant without the need for explanation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Tell me,' he said, 'how soon will they shoot me?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It might be a long time,' said O'Brien. 'You are a difficult case. But don't give up hope. Everyone is cured
            sooner or later. In the end we shall shoot you.'</p>

        <p>He&nbsp; was&nbsp; much&nbsp; better.&nbsp; He was growing fatter and stronger&nbsp; every&nbsp; day, if it
            was proper to speak of days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The white light and the humming sound were the same as ever, but the cell was a little more comfortable than
            the others he had been in. There was a pillow and a mattress on the plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They
            had given him a bath, and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin. They even gave
            him warm water to wash with. They had given him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls. They had</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>dressed his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment. They had pulled out the remnants of his teeth and given
            him a new set of dentures.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Weeks or months must have passed. It would have been possible now to keep count of the passage of time, if he
            had felt any interest in doing so, since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals. He was
            getting, he judged, three meals in the twenty&minus;four hours; sometimes he wondered dimly whether he was
            getting them by night or by day. The food was surprisingly good, with meat at every third meal. Once there
            was even a packet of cigarettes. He had no matches, but the never&minus;speaking guard who brought his food
            would give him a light. The first time he tried to smoke it made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the
            packet out for a long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the corner. At first he made no use of it.
            Even when he was awake he was completely torpid. Often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>enough to eat, and to be&nbsp; clean all&nbsp; over, was completely satisfying.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed. All he cared
            for was to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in his body. He would finger himself here and there,
            trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter.
            Finally it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely thicker
            than his knees. After that, reluctantly at first, he began exercising himself regularly. In a little while
            he could walk three kilometres, measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growing
            straighter. He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and humiliated to find what things he
            could not do. He could</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>not move out of a walk, he could not hold his stool out at arm's length, he could not stand on one leg
            without falling over. He squatted down on his heels, and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf
            he could just lift himself to a standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by
            his hands. It was hopeless, he could not raise himself a centimetre. But after a few more days a few more
            mealtimes even</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that feat was accomplished. A time came when he could do it six times running. He began to grow actually
            proud of his body, and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal. Only
            when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed, ruined face that had looked
            back at him out of the mirror.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His mind grew more active. He sat down on the plank bed, his back against the wall and the slate on his
            knees, and set to work deliberately at the task of re&minus;educating himself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as he saw&nbsp; now, he&nbsp; had been ready to capitulate
            long before he</p>

        <p>He accepted everything. The past was alterable. The past never had been altered. Oceania was at war with
            Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were guilty of the
            crimes they were charged with. He had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt. It had never
            existed, he had invented it. He remembered remembering contrary things, but those were false memories,
            products of selfdeception. How easy it all was! Only surrender, and everything else followed. It was like
            swimming against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding
            to turn round and go with the current instead of opposing it. Nothing had changed except your own attitude:
            the predestined thing happened in any case. He hardly knew why he had ever rebelled. Everything was easy,
            except !</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>wished,'&nbsp; O'Brien had said, 'I could float off this&nbsp; floor&nbsp; like&nbsp; a&nbsp; soap&nbsp;
            bubble.'&nbsp; Winston worked it out. 'If he</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>thinks</em> he floats&nbsp; off&nbsp; the floor, and if I simultaneously <em>think</em> I&nbsp; see&nbsp;
            him&nbsp; do&nbsp; it,&nbsp; then&nbsp; the&nbsp; thing&nbsp; happens.'&nbsp; Suddenly,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>like a lump of&nbsp; submerged&nbsp; wreckage breaking the surface of water,&nbsp; the&nbsp; thought&nbsp;
            burst&nbsp; into his&nbsp; mind: 'It doesn't</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>really happen. We imagine it.&nbsp; It is hallucination.'&nbsp; He pushed the&nbsp; thought&nbsp; under&nbsp;

        <p>obvious.&nbsp; It&nbsp; presupposed&nbsp; that somewhere or&nbsp; other, outside oneself, there was&nbsp; a
            'real' world&nbsp; where&nbsp; 'real'&nbsp; things</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>happened.&nbsp; But&nbsp; how&nbsp; could&nbsp; there be such a world? What&nbsp; knowledge have we of
            anything, save&nbsp; through our</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>own minds?&nbsp; All&nbsp; happenings&nbsp; are&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; mind.&nbsp; Whatever&nbsp; happens
            in all minds,&nbsp; truly happens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and he was in no danger of succumbing to it. He realized,
            nevertheless, that it ought never to have occurred to him. The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a
            dangerous thought presented itself. The process should be automatic, instinctive. <em>Crimestop,</em> they
            called it in Newspeak.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He presented himself with propositions 'the Party says the
            earth is flat', 'the party says that ice is heavier than water' and trained himself in not seeing or not
            understanding the arguments that contradicted them. It was not easy. It needed great powers of reasoning and
            improvisation. The arithmetical problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as 'two and two make
            five' were beyond his intellectual grasp. It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one
            moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical
            errors. Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.</p>

        <p>One day&nbsp; but 'one day' was&nbsp; not&nbsp; the&nbsp; right&nbsp; expression;&nbsp; just&nbsp; as
            probably it was in the middle of the night: once</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>he&nbsp; fell into a&nbsp; strange, blissful reverie. He was walking down&nbsp; the&nbsp; corridor,
            waiting&nbsp; for the bullet. He knew</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that it was coming in another moment. Everything was settled, smoothed out, reconciled. There were no more
            doubts, no more arguments, no more pain, no more fear. His body was healthy and strong. He walked easily,
            with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. He was not any longer in the narrow white
            corridors in the Ministry of Love, he was in the enormous sunlit passage, a kilometre wide, down which he
            had seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs. He was in the Golden Country, following the foot&minus;
            track across the old rabbit&minus;cropped pasture. He could feel the short springy turf under his feet and
            the gentle sunshine on his face. At the edge of the field were the elm trees, faintly stirring, and
            somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green pools under the willows.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly he started up with a shock of horror. The sweat broke out on his backbone. He had heard himself cry
            aloud:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Julia ! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence. She had seemed to be not merely with
            him, but inside him. It was as though she had got into the texture of his skin. In that moment he had loved
            her far more than he had ever done when they were together and free. Also he knew that somewhere or other
            she was still alive and needed his help.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. What had he done? How many years had he added to his
            servitude by that moment of weakness?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside. They could not let such an outburst go
            unpunished. They would know now, if they had not known before, that he was breaking the agreement he had
            made with them. He obeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old days he had hidden a heretical
            mind beneath an appearance of conformity. Now he had retreated a step further: in the mind he had
            surrendered, but he had hoped to keep the inner heart inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, but he
            preferred to be in the wrong. They would understand that&minus; O'Brien would understand it. It was all
            confessed in that single foolish cry.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He&nbsp; would&nbsp; have&nbsp; to&nbsp; start&nbsp; all&nbsp; over again. It might take&nbsp; years.&nbsp;
            He ran a hand&nbsp; over&nbsp; his&nbsp; face,&nbsp; trying&nbsp; to&nbsp; familiarize</p>

        <p>must not only think right; he must feel right, dream right. And all the while he must keep his hatred locked
            up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest of him, a
            kind of cyst.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not tell when it would happen, but a few seconds beforehand
            it should be possible to guess. It was always from behind, walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be
            enough. In that time the world inside him could turn over. And then suddenly, without a word uttered,
            without a check in his step, without the changing of a line in his face suddenly the camouflage would be
            down and bang! would go the batteries of his hatred. Hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame.
            And almost in the same instant bang! would go the bullet, too late, or too early. They would have blown his
            brain to pieces before they could reclaim it. The heretical thought would be unpunished, unrepented, out of
            their reach for ever. They would have blown a hole in their own perfection. To die hating them, that was
            freedom.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He shut his eyes. It was more difficult than accepting an intellectual discipline. It was a question of
            degrading himself, mutilating himself. He had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth. What was the most
            horrible, sickening thing of all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous face (because of constantly seeing
            it on posters he always thought of it as being a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache and the eyes
            that followed you to and fro, seemed to float into his mind of its own accord. What were his true feelings
            towards Big Brother?</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. The steel door swung open with a clang. O'Brien walked into
            the cell. Behind him were the waxen&minus;faced officer and the black&minus;uniformed guards.</p>

        <p>'Get up,' said O'Brien. 'Come here.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston stood opposite him. O'Brien took Winston's shoulders between his strong hands and looked at him
            closely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You have had thoughts of deceiving me,'&nbsp; he&nbsp; said.&nbsp; 'That&nbsp; was&nbsp; stupid. Stand up
            straighter. Look me in the face.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He paused, and went on in a gentler tone:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You are improving. Intellectually there is very little wrong with you. It is only emotionally that you have
            failed to make progress. Tell me, Winston and remember, no lies: you know that I am always able to detect a
            lie tell me, what are your true feelings towards Big Brother?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I hate him.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You hate him. Good. Then the time has come for you to take the last step. You must love Big Brother. It is
            not enough to obey him: you must love him.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He released Winston with a little push towards the guards.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Room 101,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed to know, whereabouts he was in the windowless
            building. Possibly there were slight differences in the air pressure. The cells where the guards had beaten
            him were below ground level. The room where he had been interrogated by O'Brien was high up near the roof.
            This place was many metres underground, as deep down as it was possible to go.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he hardly noticed his surroundings. All he noticed
            was that there were two small tables straight in front of him, each covered with green baize. One was only a
            metre or two from him, the other was further away, near the door. He was strapped upright in a chair, so
            tightly that he could move nothing, not even his head. A sort of pad gripped his head from behind, forcing
            him to look straight in front of him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a moment he&nbsp; was&nbsp; alone,&nbsp; then&nbsp; the&nbsp; door&nbsp; opened&nbsp; and&nbsp;
            O'Brien&nbsp; came in.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You asked me once,' said O'Brien, 'what was in Room 101. I told you that you knew the answer already.
            Everyone knows it. The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying something made of wire, a box or basket of some kind. He set
            it down on the further table. Because of the position in which O'Brien was standing. Winston could not see
            what the thing was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The worst thing in the world,' said O'Brien, 'varies from individual to individual. It may be burial alive,
            or death by fire, or by drowning, or by impalement, or fifty other deaths. There are cases where it is some
            quite trivial thing, not even fatal.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a better view of the thing on the table. It was an
            oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying it by. Fixed to the front of it was something that looked
            like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. Although it was three or four metres away from him, he
            could</p>

        <p>see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compart ments, and that there was some kind of creature in
            each. They were rats.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'In your case, said O'Brien, 'the worst thing in the world&nbsp; happens&nbsp; to be rats.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, had passed through Winston as soon as he
            caught his first glimpse of the cage. But at this moment the meaning of the mask&minus;like attachment in
            front of it suddenly sank into him. His bowels seemed to turn to water.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You can't do that!' he cried out in a high cracked voice.&nbsp; 'You&nbsp; couldn't, you couldn't! It's
            impossible.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Do you remember,' said O'Brien, 'the moment of panic that&nbsp; used to&nbsp; occur in your dreams? There
            was a wall</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of blackness in&nbsp; front of you,&nbsp; and a roaring&nbsp; sound&nbsp; in&nbsp; your&nbsp; ears.&nbsp;
            There&nbsp; was&nbsp; something terrible&nbsp; on the other side</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of the wall. You knew that&nbsp; you&nbsp; knew what it was,&nbsp; but you dared not drag it into the
            open.&nbsp; It was the rats that</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>were on&nbsp; the other side of the wall.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'O'Brien!' said Winston, making an effort to control his voice. 'You know this is not necessary. What is it
            that you want me to do?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected.
            He looked thoughtfully into the distance, as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind
            Winston's back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'By itself,' he said, 'pain is not always enough. There are occasions when a human being will stand out
            against pain, even to the point of death. But for everyone there is something unendurable something that
            cannot be contemplated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you are falling from a height it is not
            cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with
            air. It is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. It is the same with the rats. For you, they are
            unendurable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand. even if you wished to. You will do what is required of
            you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'But what is it, what is it? How can I do it&nbsp; if&nbsp; I&nbsp; don't&nbsp; know&nbsp; what it is?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table. He set it down carefully on the baize
            cloth. Winston could hear the blood singing in his ears. He had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness.
            He was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with sunlight, across which all sounds
            came to him out of immense distances. Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him. They were
            enormous rats. They were at the age when a rat's muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of
            grey.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'The rat,' said O'Brien, still addressing his invisible audience, 'although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are
            aware of that. You will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town. In some
            streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five minutes. The rats are certain to
            attack it. Within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or dying people.
            They show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed to reach Winston from far away. The rats were
            fighting; they were trying to get at each other through the partition. He heard also a deep groan of
            despair. That, too, seemed to come from outside himself.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O'Brien picked up the cage, and, as&nbsp; he&nbsp; did&nbsp; so,&nbsp; pressed&nbsp; something&nbsp; in&nbsp;
            it.&nbsp; There&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp; sharp&nbsp; click. Winston made</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair. It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head,
                was held immovably. O'Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than a metre from Winston's face.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I have pressed the first lever,' said O'Brien. 'You understand the construction of this cage. The mask will
            fit over your head, leaving no exit. When I press this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up.
            These starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets. Have you ever seen a rat leap through the air? They
            will leap</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>on to your face and bore straight into it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first. Sometimes they burrow throug
            the cheeks and devour the tongue.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be
            occurring in the air above his head. But he fought furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even
            with a split second left to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty odour of the brutes struck his
            nostrils. There was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Everything
            had gone black. For an instant he was insane, a screaming animal. Yet he came out of the blackness clutching
            an idea. There was one and only one way to save himself. He must interpose another human being, the
            <em>body</em> of another human being, between himself and the rats.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else. The wire door was a
            couple of hand&minus;spans from his face. The rats knew what was coming now. One of them was leaping up and
            down, the other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink hands against the bars, and
            fiercely sniffed the air. Winston could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the black panic took
            hold of him. He was blind, helpless, mindless.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp; common&nbsp; punishment&nbsp; in&nbsp; Imperial China,' said&nbsp; O'Brien&nbsp;
            as didactically as ever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his cheek. And then no, it was not relief, only hope, a
            tiny fragment of hope. Too late, perhaps too late. But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world
            there was just <em>one</em> person to whom he could transfer his punishment <em>one</em> body that he could
            thrust between himself and the rats. And he was shouting frantically, over and over.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't care what you do to her. Tear her face off, strip her
            to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. He was still strapped in the chair, but
            he had fallen through the floor, through the walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans,
            through the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars always away, away, away from the
            rats.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was light years distant, but O'Brien was still standing at his side. There was still the cold touch of
            wire against his cheek. But through the darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic click, and
            knew that the cage door had clicked shut and not open.</p>

        <p>X X X</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Chestnut Tree was almost empty. A ray of sunlight slanting through a window fell on dusty
            table&minus;tops. It was the lonely hour of fifteen. A tinny music trickled from the telescreens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. Now and again he glanced up at a vast face which
            eyed him from the opposite wall. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came and
            filled his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into it a few drops from another bottle with a quill through
            the cork. It was saccharine flavoured with cloves, the speciality of the cafe/.</p>

        <p>He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far as it was possible he never visualized them. They were
            something that he was half&minus;aware of, hovering close to his face, a smell that clung to his nostrils.
            As the gin rose in him he belched through purple lips. He had grown fatter since they released him, and had
            regained his old colour indeed, more than regained it. His features had thickened, the skin on nose and
            cheekbones was coarsely red, even the bald scalp was too deep a pink. A waiter, again unbidden, brought the
            chessboard and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the current issue of <em>The Times,</em> with the page turned down at the chess problem. Then, seeing that
            Winston's glass was empty, he brought the gin bottle and filled it. There was no need to give orders. They
            knew his habits. The chessboard was always waiting for him, his corner table was always reserved; even when
            the place was full he had it to himself, since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to him. He never
            even bothered to count his drinks. At irregular intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper
            which they said was the bill, but he had the impression that they always undercharged him. It would have
            made no difference if it had been the other way about. He had always plenty of money nowadays. He even had a
            job, a sinecure, more highly&minus;paid than his old job had been.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over. Winston raised his head to listen. No bulletins
            from the front, however. It was merely a brief announcement from the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding
            quarter, it appeared, the Tenth ThreeYear Plan's quota for bootlaces had been overfulfilled by 98 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It was a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights.
            'White to play and mate in two moves.' Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother. White always mates,
            he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without exception, it is so arranged. In no chess
            problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying
            triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calm power. White always mates.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much graver tone: 'You are warned to stand
            by for an important announcement at fifteen&minus;thirty. Fifteen&minus; thirty! This is news of the highest
            importance. Take care not to miss it. Fifteen&minus;thirty !' The tinking music struck up again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Winston's heart stirred. That was the bulletin from the front; instinct told him that it was bad news that
            was coming. All day, with little spurts of excitement, the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa had been
            in and out of his mind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming across the never&minus;broken
            frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africa like a column of ants. Why had it not been possible to
            outflank them in some way? The outline of the West African coast stood out vividly in his mind. He picked up
            the white knight and moved it across the board. <em>There</em> was the proper spot. Even while he saw the
            black horde racing southward he saw another force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted in their rear,
            cutting their</p>

        <p>comunications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence.
            But it was necessary to act quickly. If they could get control of the whole of Africa, if they had airfields
            and submarine bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in two. It might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the
            redivision of the world, the destruction of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinary medley of
            feeling&minus;but it was not a medley, exactly; rather it was successive layers of feeling, in which one
            could not say which layer was undermost struggled inside him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The spasm passed. He put the white knight back in its place, but for the moment he could not settle down to
            serious study of the chess problem. His thoughts wandered again. Almost unconsciously he traced with his
            finger in the dust on the table: 2+2=</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'They can't get inside you,' she had said. But they could get inside you. 'What happens to you here is
            <em>for ever,'</em> O'Brien had said. That was a true word. There were things, your own acts, from which you
            could never recover. Something was killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had seen her; he had even spoken to her. There was no danger in it. He knew as though instinctively that
            they now took almost no interest in his doings. He could have arranged to meet her a second time if either
            of them had wanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. It was in the Park, on a vile, biting
            day in March, when the earth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere
            except a few crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. He was hurrying along
            with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away from him. It struck him at once that
            she had changed in some ill&minus;defined way. They almost passed one another without a sign, then he turned
            and followed her, not very eagerly. He knew that there was no danger, nobody would take any interest in him.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She did not speak. She walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him, then seemed
            to resign herself to having him at her side. Presently they were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs,
            useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind. They halted. It was vilely cold. The wind
            whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional, dirty&minus;looking crocuses. He put his arm round
            her waist.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was no telescreen, but there must be hidden microphones: besides, they could be seen. It did not
            matter, nothing mattered. They could have lain down on the ground and done <em>that</em> if they had wanted
            to. His flesh froze with horror at the thought of it. She made no response whatever to the clasp of his arm
            ; she did not even try to disengage herself. He knew now what had changed in her. Her face was sallower, and
            there was a long scar, partly hidden by the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that was not the
            change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a surprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how
            once, after the explosion of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins, and had been
            astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing, but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle,
            which made it seem more like stone than flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to him that the texture
            of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been.</p>

        <p>She gave him another quick look of dislike.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Sometimes,' she said, 'they threaten you with something something you can't stand up to, can't even think
            about. And then you say, "Don't do it to me, do it to somebody else, do it to So&minus;and&minus;so." And
            perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop
            and didn't really mean it. But that isn't true. At the time when it happens you do mean it. You think
            there's no other way of saving yourself, and you're quite ready to save yourself that way. You <em>want</em>
            it to happen to the other person. You don't give a damn what they suffer. All you care about is yourself.'
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'All you care about is yourself,' he echoed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'And after that, you don't feel the same towards the other&nbsp; person&nbsp; any longer.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'No,' he said, 'you don't feel the same.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There did not seem to be anything more to say. The wind plastered their thin overalls against their bodies.
            Almost at once it became embarrassing to sit there in silence: besides, it was too cold to keep still. She
            said something about catching her Tube and stood up to go.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We must meet again,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Yes,' she said, 'we must meet again. '</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace behind her. They did not speak again. She did not
            actually try to shake him off, but walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her. He
            had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the Tube station, but suddenly this process of
            trailing along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable. He was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to
            get away from Julia as to get back to the Chestnut Tree Cafe/, which had never seemed so attractive as at
            this moment. He had a nostalgic vision of his corner table, with the newspaper and the chessboard and the
            everflowing gin. Above all, it would be warm in there. The next moment, not altogether by accident, he
            allowed himself to become separated from her by a small knot of people. He made a halfhearted attempt to
            catch up, then slowed down, turned, and made off in the opposite direction. When he had gone fifty metres he
            looked back. The street was not crowded, but already he could not distinguish her. Any one of a dozen
            hurrying figures might have been hers. Perhaps her thickened, stiffened body was no longer recognizable from
            behind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'At the time when it happens,' she had said, 'you do mean it.' He had meant it. He had not merely said it, he
            had wished it. He had wished that she and not he should be delivered over to the&minus;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen. A cracked and jeering note, a yellow note,
            came into it. And then perhaps it was not happening, perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance of
            sound a voice was singing:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Under the spreading chestnut tree</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I sold you and you sold me '</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tears welled up in his eyes. A passing waiter noticed that his glass was empty and came back with the gin
            bottle.</p>

        <p>He took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff grew not less but more horrible with every mouthful he
            drank. But it had become the element he swam in. It was his life, his death, and his resurrection. It was
            gin that sank him into stupor every night, and gin that revived him every morning. When he woke, seldom
            before eleven hundred, with gummed&minus;up eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken, it
            would have been impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup
            placed beside the bed overnight. Through the midday hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy,
            listening to the telescreen. From fifteen to closing&minus;time he was a fixture in the Chestnut Tree. No
            one cared what he did any longer, no whistle woke him, no telescreen admonished him. Occasionally, perhaps
            twice a week, he went to a dusty, forgotten&minus;looking office in the Ministry of Truth and did a little
            work, or what was called work. He had been appointed to a sub&minus;committee of a sub&minus;committee which
            had sprouted from one of the innumerable</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of the Eleventh Edition of the
            Newspeak Dictionary. They were engaged in producing something called an Interim Report, but what it was that
            they were reporting on he had never definitely found out. It was something to do with the question of
            whether commas should be placed inside brackets, or outside. There were four others on the committee, all of
            them persons similar to himself. There were days when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again,
            frankly admitting to one another that there was not really anything to be done. But there were other days
            when they settled down to their work almost eagerly, making a tremendous show of entering up their minutes
            and drafting long memoranda which were never finished when the argument as to what they were supposedly
            arguing about grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse, with subtle haggling over definitions, enormous
            digressions, quarrels threats, even, to appeal to higher authority. And then suddenly the life would go out
            of them and they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes, like ghosts fading at
            cock&minus;crow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raised his&nbsp; head&nbsp; again. The bulletin! But no, they
            were</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>merely changing the music. He had the map of Africa behind his eyelids. The movement of the armies was a
            diagram: a black arrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow horizontally eastward, across the
            tail</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of the first. As though for reassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait. Was it
            conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His interest flagged again. He drank another mouthful of gin, picked up the white knight and made a tentative
            move. Check. But it was evidently not the right move, because</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Uncalled, a memory floated into his mind. He saw a candle&minus;lit room with a vast white&minus;counterpaned
            bed, and himself, a boy of nine or ten, sitting on the floor, shaking a dice&minus;box, and laughing
            excitedly. His mother was sitting opposite him and also laughing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It must have been about a month before she disappeared. It was a moment of reconciliation, when the nagging
            hunger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for her had temporarily revived. He remembered
            the day well, a pelting, drenching day when the water streamed down the window&minus;pane and the light
            indoors was too dull to read by. The boredom of the two children in the dark, cramped bedroom became
            unbearable. Winston whined and grizzled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the room pulling
            everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours banged on the wall, while the
            younger child wailed intermittently. In the end his mother said, 'Now be good, and I'Il buy you a toy. A
            lovely toy you'll love it'; and then she had gone out in the rain, to a little general shop which was still
            sporadically open nearby, and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of Snakes and Ladders.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard. It was a miserable outfit. The board was cracked and
            the tiny wooden dice were so ill&minus;cut that they would hardly lie on their sides. Winston looked at the
            thing sulkily and without interest. But then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor
            to play. Soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddly&minus;winks climbed hopefully
            up the ladders and then came slithering down the snakes again, almost to the starting&minus; point. They
            played eight games, winning four each. His tiny sister, too young to understand what the game was about, had
            sat propped up</p>

        <p>against a bolster, laughing because the others were laughing. For a whole afternoon they had all been happy
            together, as in his earlier childhood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He pushed the picture out of his mind. It was a false memory. He was troubled by false memories occasionally.
            They did not matter so long as one knew them for what they were. Some things had happened, others had not
            happened. He turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again. Almost in the same instant
            it dropped on to the board with a clatter. He had started as though a pin had run into him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A shrill trumpet&minus;call had pierced the air. It was the bulletin! Victory! It always meant victory when a
            trumpet&minus; call preceded the news. A sort of electric drill ran through the cafe/. Even the waiters had
            started and pricked up their ears.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The trumpet&minus;call had&nbsp; let&nbsp; loose&nbsp; an&nbsp; enormous&nbsp; volume&nbsp; of&nbsp;

        <p>The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the
            shouting outside had died down a little. The waiters were turning back to their work. One of them approached
            with the gin bottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention as his glass was filled up. He
            was not running or cheering any longer. He was back in the Ministry of Love, with everything forgiven, his
            soul white as snow. He was in the public dock, confessing everything, implicating everybody. He was walking
            down the white&minus;tiled corridor, with the feeling of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at his
            back. The longhoped&minus;for bullet was entering his brain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath
            the dark moustache. O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self&minus;willed exile from the loving
            breast! Two gin&minus;scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all right, everything
            was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.</p>

        <p><strong>* APPENDIX. The Principles of&nbsp; Newspeak *</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meet the ideological needs of Ingsoc,
            or English Socialism. In the year 1984 there was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of
            communication, either in speech or writing. The leading articles in <em>The Times</em> were written in it,
            but this was a <em>tour de force</em> which could only be carried out by a specialist. It was expected that
            Newspeak would have finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should call it) by about the
            year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all Party members tending to use Newspeak words and
            grammatical</p>

        <p>1984</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>constructions more and more in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984, and embodied in the Ninth
            and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words
            and archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the final, perfected version, as
            embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary, that we are concerned here.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world&minus;view and mental
            habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended
            that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought that is, a
            thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>is dependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to
            every meaning that a Party member could properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and
            also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly by the invention of new
            words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox
            meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. To give a single example. The word
            <em>free</em> still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as 'This dog is free
            from lice' or 'This field is free from weeds'. It could not be used in its old sense of ' politically free'
            or 'intellectually free' since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts, and
            were therefore of necessity nameless. Quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words,
            reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be dispensed with was
            allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend but to <em>diminish</em> the range of thought, and
            this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though many Newspeak sentences, even when not
            containing newly&minus;created words, would be barely intelligible to an English&minus;speaker of our own
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>day. Newspeak words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary, the B vocabulary
            (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary. It will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but
            the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the A vocabulary,
            since the same rules held good for all three categories.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The A vocabulary.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The A vocabulary consisted of the&nbsp; words&nbsp; needed&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; business&nbsp; of
            everyday life&nbsp; for such&nbsp; things as eating,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>drinking,&nbsp; working, putting on one's&nbsp; clothes,&nbsp; going&nbsp; up&nbsp; and&nbsp; down&nbsp;
            stairs,&nbsp; riding&nbsp; in&nbsp; vehicles, gardening,&nbsp; cooking,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and the like. It was&nbsp; composed almost entirely of words&nbsp; that we already possess words&nbsp;
            like&nbsp; <em>hit,&nbsp; run,&nbsp; dog,&nbsp; tree,</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>sugar,&nbsp; house,&nbsp; field</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; but&nbsp; in&nbsp; comparison&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp;
            present&minus;day&nbsp; English&nbsp; vocabulary&nbsp; their&nbsp; number&nbsp; was&nbsp; extremely</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>small,&nbsp; while their meanings were far more rigidly&nbsp; defined. All&nbsp; ambiguities and shades of
            meaning had been</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>purged out of&nbsp; them.&nbsp; So&nbsp; far&nbsp; as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this
            class&nbsp; was simply&nbsp; a&nbsp; staccato</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>sound&nbsp; expressing&nbsp; <em>one</em> clearly&nbsp; understood&nbsp; concept. It would have been quite
            impossible to use&nbsp; the A</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>vocabulary for literary&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; or&nbsp; for&nbsp; political&nbsp; or&nbsp; philosophical&nbsp;
            discussion.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was&nbsp; intended&nbsp; only&nbsp; to express</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete&nbsp; objects&nbsp; or&nbsp; physical actions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. The first of these was an almost complete
            interchangeability between different parts of speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied
            even to very abstract words such as <em>if</em> or <em>when</em> ) could be used either as verb, noun,
            adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were of the same root, there was never
            any variation, this rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms. The word
            <em>thought,</em> for example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was taken by <em>think,</em> which did
            duty for both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followed here: in some cases it was the original
            noun that was chosen for retention, in other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning
            were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently suppressed. There was, for example,
            no such word as <em>cut,</em> its meaning being sufficiently covered by the</p>

            vocabulary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            noun&minus;verb, and adverbs by adding <em>&minus;wise</em>. Thus for example, <em>speedful</em> meant
            'rapid' and <em>speedwise</em> meant 'quickly'. Certain of our present&minus;day</p>

        <p>The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity. Subject to a few exceptions which are
            mentioned below all inflexions followed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past
            participle were the same and ended in&minus;<em>ed.</em> The preterite of <em>steal</em> was
            <em>stealed,</em> the preterite of <em>think</em> was <em>thinked,</em> and so on throughout the language,
            all such forms as <em>swam</em>, <em>gave, brought, spoke, taken,</em> etc., being abolished. All plurals
            were made by adding&minus;s or&minus;es as the case might be. The plurals of <em>man, ox, life,</em> were
            <em>mans, oxes, lifes.</em> Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding&minus;<em>er,&minus;est
                (good, gooder, goodest),</em> irregular forms and the <em>more, most</em> formation being suppressed.

        <p><strong>The B vocabulary.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately constructed for political purposes: words,
            that is to say, which not only had in every case a political implication, but were intended to impose a
            desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Without a full understanding of the principles of
            Ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correctly. In some cases they couId be translated into Oldspeak,
            or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always
            involved the loss of certain overtones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing whole
            ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary
            language.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The B words were in all cases compound words.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together in an easily pronounceable form.
            The resulting amalgam was always a noun&minus;verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>single example: the word <em>goodthink,</em> meaning, very roughly, 'orthodoxy', or, if one chose to regard
            it as a verb, 'to think in an orthodox manner'. This inflected as follows: noun&minus;verb,
            <em>goodthink;</em> past tense and past participle, <em>goodthinked;</em> present participle,
            <em>good&minus; thinking;</em> adjective, <em>goodthinkful;</em> adverb, <em>goodthinkwise;</em> verbal
            noun, <em>goodthinker.</em></p>

        <p>The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan.&nbsp; The&nbsp; words of which they were made
            up&nbsp; could</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>be any parts of speech, and could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to
            pronounce while indicating their derivation. In the word <em>crimethink</em> (thoughtcrime), for instance,

        <p>meant: to make sure,&nbsp; that&nbsp; is&nbsp; to&nbsp; say, what&nbsp; ranges of words they cancelled by

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As we have already seen in the case of the word free, words which had once borne a heretical meaning were
            sometimes retained for the sake of convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them.
            Countless other words such as <em>honour, justice, morality, internationalism, democracy, science,</em> and
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>religion</em> had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket words covered them, and, in covering them,
            abolished them. All words grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for instance, were
            contained in the single word <em>crimethink,</em> while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of
            objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word <em>oldthink.</em> Greater precision would
            have been dangerous. What was required in a Party member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient
            Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that all nations other than his own worshipped 'false gods'. He
            did not need to know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the like: probably the
            less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy. He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah: he
            knew, therefore, that</p>

        <p>all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. In somewhat the same way, the party member
            knew what constituted right conduct, and in exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of
            departure from it were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by the two Newspeak

        <p>No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. A great many were euphemisms. Such words, for
            instance, as <em>joycamp</em> (forced&minus;labour camp) or <em>Minipax</em> Ministry of Peace, i. e.
            Ministry of War) meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other
            hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of Oceanic society. An example was
            <em>prolefeed,</em> meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the
            masses. Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation 'good' when applied to the Party and
            'bad' when applied to its enemies. But in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight
            appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not from their meaning, but
            from their structure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have political significance of any kind was
            fitted into the B vocabulary. The name of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or
            institution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar shape; that is, a single easily
            pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the original derivation. In the
            Ministry of Truth, for example, the Records Department, in which Winston Smith worked, was called
            <em>Recdep,</em> the Fiction Department was called <em>Ficdep,</em> the Teleprogrammes Department was called
            <em>Teledep,</em> and so on. This was not done solely with the object of saving time. Even in the early
            decades of the twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features
            of political language; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most
            marked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations. Examples were such words as <em>Nazi,
                Gestapo, Comin&minus; tern, Inprecorr, Agitprop.</em> In the beginning the practice had been adopted as
            it were instinctively, but in Newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus
            abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>its meaning, by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it. The words
            <em>Communist International,</em> for instance, call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood,
            red flags, barricades, Karl Marx, and the Paris Commune. The word <em>Comintern,</em> on the other hand,
            suggests merely a tightly&minus;knit organization and a well&minus;defined body of doctrine. It refers to
            something almost as easily recognized, and as limited in purpose, as a chair or a table. <em>Comintern</em>
            is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought, whereas <em>Communist International</em> is a
            phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way, the associations called up
            by a word like <em>Minitrue</em> are fewer and more controllable than those called up by <em>Ministry of
                Truth.</em> This accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the
            almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning. Regularity of grammar
            was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for
            political purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which
            roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker's mind. The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from
            the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably these words</p>

        <p><em>goodthink, Minipax, prolefeed, sexcrime, joycamp, Ingsoc, bellyfeel, thinkpol,</em> and countless others
            were words of two or three syllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the
            last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at once staccato and monotonous. And this was
            exactly what was aimed at. The intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not
            ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness. For the purposes of everyday life
            it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called

        <p>well grounded in <em>doublethink</em> to avoid doing this, but within a couple of generations even the
            possibility of such a lapse would have vaished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would
            no more know that <em>equal</em> had once had the secondary meaning of 'politically equal', or that
            <em>free</em> had once meant</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>meanings&nbsp; attaching&nbsp; to&nbsp; <em>queen</em> and&nbsp; <em>rook.</em> There would be many
            crimes&nbsp; and&nbsp; errors&nbsp; which&nbsp; it&nbsp; would&nbsp; be&nbsp; beyond his</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>power to commit, simply&nbsp; because they were&nbsp; nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was
            to&nbsp; be&nbsp; foreseen</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; passage&nbsp; of&nbsp; time&nbsp; the&nbsp; distinguishing&nbsp;
            characteristics&nbsp; of&nbsp; Newspeak&nbsp; would&nbsp; become&nbsp; more&nbsp; and&nbsp; more</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>pronounced&nbsp; its words growing fewer and fewer, their meanings&nbsp; more&nbsp; and more rigid, and the
            chance of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>putting them to improper&nbsp; uses always&nbsp; diminishing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When&nbsp; Oldspeak&nbsp; had&nbsp; been once and for all superseded, the&nbsp; last&nbsp; link with the past
            would have been&nbsp; severed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>History&nbsp; had&nbsp; already&nbsp; been rewritten, but fragments of the literature of the&nbsp; past
            survived&nbsp; here and there,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>imperfectly censored, and so long&nbsp; as one retained&nbsp; one's knowledge of Oldspeak it was
            possible&nbsp; to&nbsp; read&nbsp; them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the&nbsp; future such fragments, even if they chanced&nbsp; to survive, would be&nbsp; unintelligible and
            untranslatable. It</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was&nbsp; impossible&nbsp; to&nbsp; translate&nbsp; any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak&nbsp; unless it
            either referred to&nbsp; some&nbsp; technical</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>process&nbsp; or&nbsp; some&nbsp; very&nbsp; simple&nbsp; everyday&nbsp; action,&nbsp; or&nbsp; was&nbsp;
            already&nbsp; orthodox&nbsp; <em>(goodthinkful</em> would&nbsp; be&nbsp; the&nbsp; NewsPeak</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>expression)&nbsp; in&nbsp; tendency.&nbsp; In&nbsp; practice&nbsp; this meant that no book&nbsp; written
            before&nbsp; approximately&nbsp; 1960&nbsp; could&nbsp; be</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>translated&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; whole.&nbsp; Pre&minus;revolutionary&nbsp; literature&nbsp; could&nbsp;
            only&nbsp; be&nbsp; subjected&nbsp; to&nbsp; ideological translation that is,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>alteration in sense as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; language. Take for example the well&minus;known passage&nbsp;
            from&nbsp; the&nbsp; Declaration of</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Independence:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>We&nbsp; hold&nbsp; these truths to be self&minus;evident, that all men&nbsp; are&nbsp; created equal,
                that they are endowed by their</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>creator&nbsp; with&nbsp; certain&nbsp; inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty,&nbsp;
                and&nbsp; the&nbsp; pursuit&nbsp; of&nbsp; happiness.&nbsp; That</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among men, deriving their powers from the consent of
                the governed. That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of those ends, it is the right of
                the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government. . .</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It would have been quite impossible to render this into Newspeak while keeping to the sense of the original.
            The nearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word
            <em>crimethink.</em> A full translation could only be an ideological translation, whereby Jefferson's words
            would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, already being transformed in this way. Considerations
            of prestige made it desirable to preserve the memory of certain historical figures, while at the same time
            bringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc. Various writers, such as Shakespeare,
            Milton, Swift, Byron, Dickens, and some others were therefore in process of translation: when the task had
            been completed, their original writings, with all else that survived of the literature of the past, would be
            destroyed. These translations were a slow and difficult business, and it was not expected that they would be
            finished before the first or second decade of the twenty&minus;first century. There were also large
            quantities of merely utilitarian literature indispensable technical manuals, and the like that had to be
            treated in the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>same way. It was chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary work of translation that the final
            adoption of Newspeak had been fixed for so late a date as 2050.</p>
