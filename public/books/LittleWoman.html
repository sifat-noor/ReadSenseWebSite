        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the man of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for he told me to
            take special care of Mother while he was gone.&rdquo; (page 14)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and be what he loves to call me, &lsquo;a little woman,&rsquo; and not be rough and
            wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else.&rdquo; (page 18)</p>

        <p>Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but girls are infinitely more so. (page 71)</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Housekeeping ain&rsquo;t no joke.&rdquo; (page 114)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Have regular hours for work and play, make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you
            understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few
            regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite of poverty.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true, and we could
            live in them?&rdquo; (page 143)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t have fortunes left them in that style nowadays, men have to work and women to marry
            for money. It&rsquo;s a dreadfully unjust world.&rdquo; (page 158)</p>

        <p>She could not speak, but she did &ldquo;hold on,&rdquo; and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand
            comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in
            her trouble. (page 183)</p>

        <p>Jo&rsquo;s face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her, and she found it hard not to
            look mysterious and important. Meg observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had
            learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so she felt sure of being told
            everything if she did not ask. (page 202)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and genius, especially ambitious young men
            and women. (page 250)</p>

        <p>Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new and beautiful to young eyes, while her father and
            friend watched her from the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the
            happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling
            on the sea. (page 302)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Girls are so queer you never know what they mean. They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man out
            of his wits just for the fun of it.&rdquo; (pages 351-352)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Little they cared what anybody thought, for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in
            any life, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the plain, wealth on the poor, and
            gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven. (page 457)</p>

        <p><strong>LOUISA MAY ALCOTT</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Louisa May Alcott was born on November 29, 1832, in Germantown, Pennsylvania, the second of four daughters of
            Amos Bronson and Abigail Alcott. Her mother, known in the family as &ldquo;Abba,&rdquo; was from a
            distinguished Boston family. Her father, a self-educated son of farmers, was an educator and reformer; his
            controversial and often unpopular teaching philosophies kept him from steady employment and the family
            (Louisa called it the &ldquo;Pathetic Family&rdquo;) continually on the edge of poverty. The Alcotts often
            relied upon the generosity of family and friends, including American essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson,
            who frequently provided financial support.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Louisa was two, the family moved to Boston to be near Abba&rsquo;s family and Emerson. They would move
            frequently between Boston and Concord for the rest of Louisa&rsquo;s life. Bronson Alcott became part of a
            group of writers and philosophers known as the Transcendentalist Club, which included Emerson and writer
            Henry David Thoreau, both of whom Louisa idolized. Throughout her life Louisa was brash and moody, with a
            quick tongue that often angered her father.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alcott wrote her first stories at age fifteen, during what she called her &ldquo;sentimental period.&rdquo;
            As a teenager, she pursued many dramatic and literary endeavors: producing and acting in family theatricals;
            creating a series of tales for Emerson&rsquo;s young daughter, Ellen, which she called Flower Fables; and
            founding a family newspaper, the Olive Leaf. Her first published work was the poem &ldquo;Sunlight,&rdquo;
            which appeared pseud onymously in Peterson&rsquo;s Magazine in 1851.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Louisa&rsquo;s father didn&rsquo;t earn sufficient income to support the family, so Louisa, her mother, and
            her sisters worked&mdash;Abba as one of the nation&rsquo;s first social workers, the girls at sewing and
            teaching. Alcott viewed herself as a pillar of financial and emotional support to her female relatives. She
            was devastated in 1858 when her younger sister, Elizabeth, died of scarlet fever and her elder sister, Anna,
            announced her engagement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During the American Civil War, Alcott moved briefly to Washington, D.C., to work as a Union Army nurse, until
            a bout with typhoid cut her service short. While convalescing, she reworked her letters to her family into a
            series called Hospital Sketches; published in 1863, it brought her favorable notice as a writer. Over the
            next several years she published a number of children&rsquo;s collections and anonymously wrote fantastic
            and gothic tales. In 1867 she was offered the editorship of the children&rsquo;s magazine Merry&rsquo;s
            Museum. The following year, commissioned by the publisher Roberts Brothers, she wrote Little Women in six
            weeks. With the publication of Little Women, Alcott gained immense fame and achieved long-sought financial
            security for herself and her family. The sequel Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo&rsquo;s Boys was
            published in 1871.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Always active in the suffrage movement, in 1879 Alcott became the first woman to vote in Concord. When her
            sister May died in childbirth the same year, Alcott adopted the baby, a girl named Lulu. Alcott&rsquo;s
            health declined greatly during this period, due to the lingering effects of mercury in the treatment she had
            received for typhoid fever during the Civil War. Too weak to write extensively, Alcott would publish and
            republish her children&rsquo;s story collections until her death. The feminist-leaning Jo&rsquo;s Boys was
            also published during this period, in 1886. Louisa May Alcott died March 6, 1888, two days after the death
            of her father. She is buried with her parents.</p>

        <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On March 22, 1927, the New York Times printed the results of a poll of high-school students who had been
            asked, &ldquo;What book has interested you most?&rdquo; The respondents overwhelmingly chose Little Women as
            their favorite, as the book that had most influenced them, surpassing even the Bible, which stalled at the
            number two position. Pause a moment to absorb this: Fifty-eight years after its publication in full, Louisa
            May Alcott&rsquo;s domestic novel Little Women bore more influence on the lives and thought processes of
            American high-school students than did the Bible. Little Women, as John Lennon would claim of the Beatles
            forty years later, was more popular than Jesus. Although one may want to interpret this poll primarily as an
            indication of the increasingly secular interests of twentieth-century American youth, one must allow that,
            with all the other choices of reading matter available, beating out the Bible is clearly a tremendous feat.
            As related proof of Little Women&rsquo;s influence, John Bunyan&rsquo;s unusual 1684 religious allegory The
            Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&mdash;which is the March family&rsquo;s favorite book and guide to life in Little
            Women, and which provides an organizing framework for Alcott&rsquo;s novel &mdash;came in at number three in
            the poll. I do believe Bunyan must thank Louisa May Alcott for his book&rsquo;s second wind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In remarking that Little Women has been an incredibly popular text, a commentator risks making a gigantic
            understatement. Part one of the novel, released on September 30, 1868, sold out its first print run in four
            weeks (at $1.25 a book&mdash;some sources note that the price was jacked up to $1.50 after the book&rsquo;s
            ability to sell had been proved), though its generally positive early reviews had not yet labeled the story
            a must-read. Part two, released on April 14, 1869, also sold out quickly, even with the dramatic increase in
            its initial print run. In 1932, a few years after the novel went into the public domain (meaning that any
            publishing firm could print it), its long-authorized publisher, Boston&rsquo;s Little, Brown and Company,
            reported having sold a total of more than 1,500,000 copies since 1898&mdash;thirty years after the book was
            first published. Little Women was also an international phenomenon. Publishers&rsquo; Weekly noted in 1929
            that, in addition to its longstanding popularity in England, Little Women had been translated into French,
            German, Dutch, Greek, and Chinese (it was a favored Chinese New Year gift). By 1969, one hundred years after
            the publication of the full text, the list of translations included Arabic, Bengali, Indonesian, Irish,
            Japanese, Russian, Swedish, and Urdu. On a more personal level, by the end of 1869 Louisa May Alcott had
            attained clear celebrity status at age thirty-six; her widespread fame far surpassed that of her well-known
            philosopher father, Amos Bronson Alcott (just as the first part of Little Women had far outsold his own 1868
            offering, an essay collection called Tablets).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Prior to Little Women, Alcott had written primarily for adults, with the exception of Flower Fables, an 1854
            collection of children&rsquo;s fairy stories (Alcott also edited a monthly children&rsquo;s periodical,
            Merry&rsquo;s Museum). In 1863 she had begun publishing sensational Gothic-style stories in newspapers and
            magazines, anonymously or under a pseudonym, mainly to earn the ready money that these popular narratives
            commanded. Her serious novel Moods (1864) had met with neither critical esteem nor commercial notice; but
            the success of Little Women turned its author into a revered, wealthy children&rsquo;s book writer. The
            book&rsquo;s popularity would seem to have been nearly ordained when one considers the circumstances of its
            birth and its contractual engineering. Both its publisher and its author envisioned Little Women primarily
            (if hopefully) as a moneymaking venture. The original publisher, Thomas Niles of Roberts Brothers, had to
            persuade Alcott to write a tale for girls to compete with a new type of boys&rsquo; book by prolific
            novelists such as Horatio Alger (Ragged Dick) and Oliver Optic (Poor and Proud), which were in wide demand.
            Novels like these introduced a genre of children&rsquo;s fiction written as entertainment, not mainly for
            moral instruction&mdash;a somewhat controversial innovation at the time. Alcott resisted the idea of writing
            a girls&rsquo; book; she doubted both her interest in a project for a young female audience and her ability
            to write it effectively. She claimed that she didn&rsquo;t know how to accomplish the task: She wasn&rsquo;t
            even especially concerned with the lives of girls outside her own household of four sisters. As a way to
            overcome her reservations, Alcott would eventually mine her own family&rsquo;s experiences as the basis for
            Little Women&rsquo;s March sisters, their characterizations, and many of their pastimes, conflicts, and
            daily duties. Alcott finally convinced herself that &ldquo;lively, simple books are very much needed for
            girls, and perhaps I can supply the need.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The promise of earning more money to assist her financially struggling family also helped Alcott to agree to
            the project. Niles offered her royalties (a percentage of future sales) rather than a simple flat
            author&rsquo;s fee paid upon acceptance of the manuscript. This was a fantastic deal: In Little Women novice
            writer Jo March is thrilled to be paid $300 for her first novel; although Alcott, as a better-known writer,
            would have received a larger flat fee than this, her royalties plan would earn her $8,500 by the end of 1869
            alone. Despite Alcott&rsquo;s and Niles&rsquo;s initial fears that the novel&rsquo;s opening chapters were
            too dull, and thus wouldn&rsquo;t sell the book well, the first part of her fictional
            experiment&mdash;detailing the homey adventures through which the four New England March sisters begin to
            mature during one year of the American Civil War&mdash;was an immediate, unqualified best-seller.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All these numbers, statistics, and editions clearly indicate that Little Women has universal appeal. One
            strong reason is the story&rsquo;s essentially domestic, apolitical nature. After determining that her
            inclusion of too many controversial ideas about marriage had hurt sales of Moods, Alcott decided to make her
            girls&rsquo; book idea-free: &ldquo;My next book shall have no ideas in it, only facts, and the people shall
            be as ordinary as possible.&rdquo; Most readers would agree that Alcott doesn&rsquo;t necessarily hold to
            such a strict scheme&mdash;she repeatedly reinforces her moral ideas about self-sacrifice and
            altruism&mdash;but overall the novel does place plot considerations above politics, cultural or otherwise.
            For example, Little Women is set during the Civil War, but Alcott declines to comment on this potentially
            polarizing topic, even though she had disturbing firsthand experience of its effects as a nurse in
            Washington, D.C. (she had previously published her wartime observations and opinions in Hospital Sketches,
            written for adults and published in 1863). Her grueling, gruesome nursing duties left Alcott sickened and
            exhausted, and she was forced to return home after spending only six weeks tending the injured and dying
            soldiers. Although Mr. March in Little Women ministers to Union troops, the novel includes very little
            commentary on his experiences in doing so, or even on the causes or goals of the war. Alcott instead
            substitutes general praise for the soldiers and demonstrates the supportive sewing and knitting work that
            women like the Marches performed on the domestic front. Similarly, contemporary controver sial reform issues
            such as the abolition of slavery, which was very close to the Alcott family heart, are also left untouched
            in the novel. We know that Jo is a great believer in social reform&mdash;she allows a mixed-race child to
            attend her school, and she is vocal about women&rsquo;s rights&mdash;but Alcott doesn&rsquo;t give us many
            details. Jo makes several feminist declarations, but her own family and friends constitute her main
            audience, and she ultimately ends up living much more conventionally than she previously had forecast. A
            practical-minded author, Alcott specifically chose not to proselytize for her beliefs lest she risk
            alienating potential book buyers from different regions of the United States&mdash;consumers who, given her
            royalties arrangement, could provide her living.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The author&rsquo;s strategy of ordinariness worked. An early anonymous review in the Nation (October 22,
            1868) quietly praises Little Women as &ldquo;an agreeable little story, which is not only very well adapted
            to the readers for whom it is especially intended, but may also be read with pleasure by older
            people.&rdquo; The reviewer labels the March girls &ldquo;healthy types,... drawn with a certain
            cleverness&rdquo; yet complains of the text&rsquo;s lack of &ldquo;what painters call atmosphere,&rdquo; its
            over-reliance upon local color, and, strangely, &ldquo;things and people [in the novel] ... remaining, under
            all circumstances, somewhat too persistently themselves.&rdquo; As has often been the case with extremely
            popular books, this early review did not anticipate its subject&rsquo;s wild success. Another anonymous
            review, from the December 1868 issue of Arthur&rsquo;s Home Magazine, gives advice that has been followed
            for generations: &ldquo;Parents desiring a Christmas book for a girl from ten to sixteen years cannot do
            better than to purchase this.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alcott hinted at the end of the first part of Little Women that a sequel might be forthcoming,
            &ldquo;depend[ing] upon the reception given to the first act of the domestic drama&rdquo; (page 229). She
            included this teaser even though she would later claim, upon learning that a second installment was in fact
            demanded</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of her, that she disliked the very idea of sequels. Part two of Little Women, originally titled Good Wives to
            portend the girls&rsquo; development as married women, begins with the eldest sister Meg&rsquo;s marriage.
            Upon its release, Little Women, part two, was hailed as extending the March story by &ldquo;loading the
            palate without sickishness&rdquo; (by an anonymous reviewer in Commonwealth, April 24, 1869), although some
            might have cause to argue such an assessment. A review in the National Anti-Slavery Standard (May 1, 1869)
            praises the ideal families the book portrays and predicts that life will imitate art: &ldquo;Thousands of
            young people will read [Alcott&lsquo;s] story of these healthy, happy homes, and their standard of home and
            happiness must in many cases be raised.&rdquo; The first part of this prediction has certainly come true;
            the second, although something to hope for in general, seems a bit much to ask even of this wholesome novel.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sequel was written to appease Alcott&rsquo;s many fans, who had been begging the author for more
            information about the March sisters&rsquo; future experiences&mdash;namely whom, and how well, they married.
            Although as a feminist Alcott personally resented the implication that her March girls&rsquo; future
            happiness depended upon marriage as an end in itself, she did succeed in pairing off most of her characters,
            although not in the neat ways her romantic readers had desired or even anticipated. Alcott&rsquo;s unusual
            choices in this regard mystified and disappointed not only many of her contemporary nineteenth-century
            admirers but generations of girls to follow, who wanted the outspokenly independent, ambitious second
            sister, Jo, married off according to their own fancy&mdash;not to mention future generations of feminist
            literary critics who bemoaned Alcott&rsquo;s decision to marry her off at all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alcott absorbed much of her reform interests from her mother, Abigail &ldquo;Abba&rdquo; Alcott (nee May).
            Marmee in Little Women is an idealized version of Abba. Whereas Marmee represses her anger for the good of
            her family, Abba was known for her sharp tongue and occasional inability to get along with her neighbors.
            Abba actively participated in various contemporary reform movements, agitating against slavery and for
            temperance and women&rsquo;s rights, among other causes, and providing an excellent example of activism for
            her daughters. Even more than Marmee does, Abba Alcott worked and struggled to keep her family financially
            afloat; the shabby-genteel aspect of the March household stems from the Alcotts&rsquo; own straitened
            financial circumstances. Papa Alcott, unlike Papa March, however, was not absent on such a selfless mission
            as army chaplaincy. Writer and educator Bronson Alcott was associated with the original group of New England
            transcendental philosophers, and he tended in practice to worry more about how his family conformed to his
            social theories than about its livelihood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The transcendentalism Bronson Alcott espoused was an extremely influential quasi-religious American
            philosophical movement that flourished in the 1830s and &lsquo;40s, most neatly summed up in Ralph Waldo
            Emerson&rsquo;s 1836 essay Nature. As a behavioral program, transcendentalism promoted living simply, in
            intellectual fellowship with other like-minded thinkers and in close contact with nature, and keeping
            one&rsquo;s body pure by avoiding alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and often, as in the case of the Alcott family,
            meat. As an explanatory counterpart to these lifestyle recommendations, transcendentalism&rsquo;s more
            mystical aspects emphasized human beings&rsquo; metaphysical, intuitive spiritual core, which, in turn,
            evidenced mankind&rsquo;s inherent personal divinity. The reverence for nature, manual labor, and
            self-reliance took its most notable form in Henry David Thoreau&rsquo;s famous Walden Pond experiment in
            self-sufficiency (1845-1847). Emerson and Thoreau, friends of Bronson&rsquo;s (Emerson had provided funds
            toward the Alcott family&rsquo;s support), were two of young Louisa&rsquo;s romantic crushes; some scholars
            have suggested Emerson as a partial model for Professor Friedrich Bhaer in Little Women. Bronson Alcott
            raised his daughters according to his own transcendentalist-influenced educational beliefs, encouraging
            stringent self-analysis from them starting at an early age, through written assessments of their behavior
            and development that they would produce about themselves for his perusal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bronson Alcott seemed to have absolved himself of nearly all financial responsibility toward his wife and
            children; this would have been scandalous or unforgivable at the time in most social circles, except that he
            styled himself as a genius&mdash;a philosopher, not a worker. Yet a family cannot live on social and
            educational theories alone. At one point, around the time of his ill-fated utopian communal-living project,
            Fruitlands (1843), Bronson seriously considered formally abandoning his wife and young children; his
            abstract intellectual nature led him to raise the issue with them as a matter for family debate. Facets of
            Bronson Alcott do appear in Father March: His favorite place is his study, and he loves his books and
            discussing philosophy. But a reader who knows that Bronson Alcott&rsquo;s own family skills left much to be
            desired will find even more poignant Father March&rsquo;s gentle strength and paternal perfection, as well
            as the confidence his daughters have in his emotional support and devotion to his family.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The eldest March sister, Meg, is based on Alcott&rsquo;s oldest sister, Anna. Alcott uses her own dismay at
            the rupture of the family household brought about by Anna&rsquo;s wedding to parallel Jo&rsquo;s (and
            Meg&rsquo;s) resistance to Meg&rsquo;s marriage in Little Women. The prototype for shy Beth March was the
            third Alcott sister, Elizabeth (&ldquo;Lizzie&rdquo;), who, similar to Beth, had contracted scarlet fever
            after nursing a neighbor in 1856. Lizzie never fully recovered; doctors suggested various physical and
            mental sources, including hysteria, for her continued frailty. She slowly wasted away over a period of two
            years, eventually refusing even to eat. Alcott&rsquo;s youngest sister, Abba May, served as the model for
            the petulant, spoiled, and beautiful Amy March, an artist like her real-life counterpart. May&rsquo;s
            somewhat naive published illustrations for the first edition of Little Women unfortunately met with
            widespread critical disapproval (an early reviewer called the engravings &ldquo;indifferently
            executed&rdquo; and &ldquo;betray[ing] ... a want of anatomical knowledge&rdquo;). However, she later
            studied painting in Europe (a trip financed through Louisa&rsquo;s earnings from writing), lived in the Mont
            martre neighborhood of Paris near the experimental Impressionist painters of the day, and became acquainted
            with American Impressionist artist Mary Cassatt. May&rsquo;s skills improved, and her artwork ultimately was
            accepted into Paris salon galleries in 1877 and 1879. Alcott claimed to have based Theodore
            &ldquo;Laurie&rdquo; Laurence, Jo&rsquo;s best friend and neighbor, on two of her own admirers: her friend
            Alfred Whitman and Polish revolutionary Ladislas Wisniewski, who escorted Alcott around Paris during her
            1865 European travels.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Louisa May Alcott based Jo on herself. Consequently Jo is the most fully realized, complex character and, not
            surprisingly, the one most beloved by Alcott&rsquo;s readers across generations and most inspira tional for
            these readers&rsquo; own fantasies and ambitions. The character shares the author&rsquo;s November birth
            month, strong concerns about women&rsquo;s claims to independence and artistic expression, and the desire to
            be a writer and to broaden her experience through travel far from her provincial New England home. The
            titles of Jo&rsquo;s sensational stories are identical to some of Alcott&rsquo;s own early efforts. Louisa
            and Jo share the title of their first published story, &ldquo;The Rival Painters,&rdquo; for example;
            Louisa&rsquo;s version appeared in print in 1852. Even the cylindrical pillow Jo uses as a silent marker for
            her approachability in part two of the novel&mdash;if Jo stands it on end next to her on the sofa, it means
            she&rsquo;s in a good mood; lying flat, the cushion signifies the opposite and serves notice that her family
            shouldn&rsquo;t disturb her&mdash;echoes Alcott&rsquo;s own &ldquo;mood pillow,&rdquo; which remains on
            display at Orchard House, a former Alcott family residence in Concord, Massachusetts, that is now a museum.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Critics have often remarked upon the more masculine aspects (for her time) of Jo&rsquo;s characterization:
            her boyish nickname, her husky voice, her desire to play only the male roles in family theatricals, the
            &ldquo;gentlemanly&rdquo; linen collar she wears, her natural use of the phrase &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your
            man,&rdquo; her restless spirit, her ambition to do something splendid with her life, her desire for fame,
            her love of such sports as running and riding. Jo claims she wants to marry Meg herself to keep her in the
            family. She doesn&rsquo;t care much for the company of other girls, with the exception of her sisters, of
            course, and she positively loathes girlish gossip; instead, she appreciates &ldquo;good strong words that
            mean something&rdquo; (p. 43). (When Amy forces Jo to accompany her on social calls in chapter 29,
            Jo&rsquo;s humorous mockery of the girls they visit makes for one of the novel&rsquo;s most unforgettable
            episodes.) Unlike her more traditional, ladylike sisters, Jo understands the need for social reform on a
            number of issues affecting women&rsquo;s autonomy. Not inclined to domestic responsibility&mdash;or skill,
            for that matter&mdash;Jo views her future published stories as her children.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo&rsquo;s masculine identification may begin to explain why at the end of the novel she opens a school for
            boys instead of for girls, which her social beliefs might dictate as appropriately reparative. Her empathy
            with the male gender seems to preclude any sympathy she might have for her fellow young women, and her
            decision to open a boys&rsquo; school, even given her unorthodox admission policies, is a fairly
            conventional one. Jo, depicted throughout Little</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Women as an eccentric, outrageously unconventional character, makes some customary choices in the end and is
            certainly no radical. Although her husband may be unexpected, she marries nonetheless. Overall, Jo&rsquo;s
            feminism and mas culinity have suggested to some later commentators that a latent homosexuality lies beneath
            her surface, and, by extension, beneath her creator&rsquo;s as well. Alcott&rsquo;s own disinclination to
            marry and her devotion to feminist reform work and agitation have led these critics to question her sexual
            preferences.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once one begins to think further about Alcott&rsquo;s novel, certain contradictions emerge, particularly for
            more recent readers. There were always things about the March sisters that puzzled me, for example. The
            family complains of being poor, and indeed can&rsquo;t even afford to buy each other Christmas presents, yet
            they keep a servant, the faithful Hannah. How impoverished, then, could the Marches be? The family&rsquo;s
            financial situation must have been very bad indeed for Aunt March to offer to adopt one of the daughters,
            thus the Marches&rsquo; priorities are very interesting. Would it have been unseemly in its social circles
            for the family not to employ a servant? Is Hannah another charity case? That is, was it more important for
            the Marches to spend what extra money they did have to provide another person with a livelihood than to
            spend it on material luxuries (even if, as is the case with their Christmas breakfast, donated to a truly
            impoverished immigrant family, those material luxuries were food)?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Clearly the Marches are not as poor as Meg thinks they are. The sisters&rsquo; Christian-inspired
            self-sacrifice, however, can seem at times to border on masochism, which may lead one to question the
            girls&rsquo; motivations. Are they so generous and accommodating because they want to be, for
            altruism&rsquo;s sake? Are they competing with each other in trying to please their impossibly good mother,
            the judge of their virtuousness? Or have they come to enjoy abnegation for what it represents: their
            worthiness to God and society? Beth and Jo&rsquo;s selflessness competitions&mdash;when, for example, Jo
            wins a writing contest and offers Beth a trip away with her spoils&mdash;at times suggest the elaborate
            sacrifices of medieval saints. Beth, a household saint in her homely shrine, wears a metaphorical hair shirt
            and practically flagellates herself daily, even within her transcendental universe. One wonders how much
            Beth&rsquo;s fate itself is actually a sacrifice in Alcott&rsquo;s mind. Such a typical Marmee maxim as
            &ldquo;a kiss for a blow is always best&rdquo; is a bit disturbing when taken with her other advice as a
            reinforcement of the need for female sacrifice, even if it does echo New Testament doctrines to turn the
            other cheek.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Marmee displays her tremendous devotion to God in a few preachy monologues, particularly in chapter 9, yet
            the family, although clearly Protestant, is not described as belonging to any particular sect&mdash;perhaps
            another extension of the novel&rsquo;s planned universality. As important as religion seems to be in their
            lives, the Marches offer little formal worship; they do not attend church services, for example, and their
            relationship to God seems very general, represented through praying privately, singing religious hymns, and
            imitating Bunyan&rsquo;s questing hero, Christian, from The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress. Aesthetic Amy&rsquo;s
            fascination with the colorful, exotic Roman Catholicism of Aunt March&rsquo;s French maid is thus
            understandable, and Marmee does not reject out of hand the religious objects, such as rosary beads and a
            devotional print of the Virgin Mary, that Amy brings back from her aunt&rsquo;s house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The March girls&rsquo; relationship with their mother is noteworthy for how it reinforces a rather
            claustrophobic household dynamic. Although many readers, particularly mothers, may find it touching that Meg
            reserves the &ldquo;first kiss&rdquo; that concludes her marriage ceremony for her mother, most others will
            note the utter strangeness of this choice. Marmee happily accepts what should be the new husband&rsquo;s
            right. What&rsquo;s going on here? Marmee&rsquo;s total love sometimes seems to negate her daughters&rsquo;
            desire for adult romantic relationships, which they instead seem to fear. Marmee&rsquo;s fully embraced
            devotion unsettles the normal course of the girls&rsquo; adolescent development from sheltered dependence
            into autonomous adulthood; indeed, the thought of one sister leaving the nest throws the household into
            emotional turmoil. Of course, nineteenth-century families thought of themselves differently than
            twenty-first-century families do, but Meg&rsquo;s kiss is still quite unusual. Jo swears she&rsquo;d never
            pop the family&rsquo;s heretofore hermetic bubble, as Meg has done through marriage, yet she quickly moves
            to New York City to work and to try her talents as a writer. Proximity, apparently, does not define the word
            abandonment in the March household; rather, the commencement of a separate, conjugal life does. Jo seems to
            realize the danger&mdash;and demonstrates her progress from self-centered idealist to a more thoughtful,
            practical type&mdash;when she notes late in part two, &ldquo;Mothers are the best lovers in the world,
            but... I&rsquo;d like to try all kinds&rdquo; (p. 422).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Marmee tells her daughters early on that being chosen and loved by a good husband is the best thing that
            could ever happen to them. Of course, this is better than being chosen by a bad one, but many readers may
            secretly wish that someone like Alcott hadn&rsquo;t written such things! We know the author didn&rsquo;t
            achieve this vaunted feminine ideal herself&mdash;she served instead as her family&rsquo;s caretaker to the
            end of her life, dying just two days after her father. Glorifying marriage here reads either as a sad,
            perhaps even pathetic statement on the relationships her own spinster status had caused her to miss, or as a
            purely disingenuous commentary on what had traditionally been expected of women. Which is worse? Is Alcott
            bending over backward in trying not to instill her own &ldquo;outlandish&rdquo; beliefs in young girls? Is
            she trying to conciliate traditional values in order not to damage her book sales? Is this inclusion some
            kind of apology ripe for psychoanalytic critique? If, however, through the girls&rsquo; trials we are made
            to see Marmee as a comforting voice of reason, how are we to interpret her prediction, given as domestic
            gospel truth? The central question remains: Where is the real Louisa May Alcott, and why doesn&rsquo;t she
            appear in Little Women? The most accommodating answer would insist that she does appear, frequently in
            specific autobiographical details. She isn&rsquo;t present enough, however, to satisfy some critics, who
            view Little Women as a wasted opportunity for Alcott to have had her characters walk the feminist walk
            instead of, in Jo&rsquo;s case in particular, make compromises.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alcott&rsquo;s cynicism about women&rsquo;s traditional roles&mdash;and the impossible standards to which
            many women hold themselves in trying to adjust to a new prescribed role&mdash;does come across more directly
            on certain occasions in Little Women. The satirical &ldquo;salute&rdquo; to Babydom, which Meg and her
            husband, John, inhabit in chapter 38 following the birth of their twins, portrays one perspective on
            overindulgent parenthood but also reveals some limits on just how far the author was willing to stretch her
            patience in depicting the trinity of hearth, home, and husband as the pinnacle of success for any woman.
            &ldquo;If [John] hinted at [attending] a lecture or concert,&rdquo; Alcott writes, &ldquo;he was answered
            with a reproachful look [from Meg], and a decided&mdash;&lsquo;Leave my children for pleasure,
            never!&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 377). Alcott&rsquo;s commentary on spinsters (her own social category) is also
            telling; she carefully entreats her readers not to laugh at older unmarried women, because &ldquo;often very
            tender, tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns, and many
            silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make the faded faces beautiful in God&rsquo;s
            sight&rdquo; (pp. 424-425). Alcott undercuts the seriousness of these ideas by joking that her readers, as
            Jo has done in the part of the story these passages interrupt, have probably fallen asleep during her
            digression, yet her points are well taken. This defense of spinsterhood, if sentimental, also comes across
            as perfectly sincere, and for very good reason.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alcott&rsquo;s Gothic sensational stories&mdash;of a type popular with the masses (and with Jo, until she is
            instructed otherwise) but considered rather lurid by the literary establishment of her day&mdash;offered her
            a bit more freedom than Little Women&rsquo;s realism did. In some of these, Alcott pushes harder on
            girls&rsquo; impulses toward independence, evidenced by the innate (but usually suppressed) disrespect for
            authority that Jo demonstrates in Little Women. For example, the frustrated, impetuous teenage heroine of
            Alcott&rsquo;s sensational novel A Long Fatal Love Chase (written in 1866 but not published until 1995)
            &mdash;the evocatively named orphan Rosamond Vivian&mdash;shrieks in a fit of adolescent pique to her
            uncaring grandfather that she would sell her soul to Satan for a year of freedom, rather than have to endure
            her stultifying, lonely life with him (a vow she comes to rue shortly after her grandfather&rsquo;s
            mysterious friend Phillip Tempest wins her in a card game). Words such as those never issue from the mouth
            of Jo March, who, although somewhat constrained, at least has a loving home life. When Jo approaches such
            sentiments, she gets a moralizing lecture from Marmee or another March sister by way of counterpoint.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some critics also regret, early in the book, the girls&rsquo; having to assume masculine identities in order
            to compose their family newspaper, based on Charles Dickens&rsquo;s Pickwick Papers. Alcott personally knew
            the influential feminist writer Margaret Fuller, who edited the main transcendentalist journal, the Dial,
            and she easily could have adapted Fuller&rsquo;s experience for her March sisters and had them create the
            newspaper without resorting to male drag.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But had Alcott written the scene without the girls&rsquo; imaginative adoptions of famous fictional personae,
            would the newspaper meetings have been as colorful? Probably not, nor nearly as entertaining for children.
            Essentially, although Alcott&rsquo;s choices in Little Women may be frustrating, we have to remember that
            the author&rsquo;s goals for the novel&mdash;to sell books and to entertain children, both of which she
            achieved&mdash;are different from the ones we assign to her with hindsight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s true that Alcott&rsquo;s most famous novel is a period piece; but when compared to traditional
            nineteenth-century literature for children available at the time, Little Women&rsquo;s protagonists are
            remarkably complex, even slightly&mdash;if an emphatic slightly&mdash;subversive. Generally speaking, the
            young characters in popular American children&rsquo;s literature prior to Alcott&rsquo;s time were either
            wholly wicked brats who entirely deserved the strict punishment they received or purely angelic little
            saints in whose mouths the proverbial butter could never melt. In either case, these fictional children
            spoke like little adults; one early criticism of Alcott&rsquo;s novel involved the characters&rsquo;
            (especially Jo&rsquo;s and Laurie&rsquo;s) use of slang terms (Jo often uses work in the revised text, when
            she had used grub in the original) and quasi-cusswords, like &ldquo;Jupiter Ammon!&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;Christopher Columbus!&rdquo;&mdash;bone-chilling language, to be sure. (Contemporary critics also
            bemoaned the March girls&rsquo; shocking practice of staging plays on the Christmas holiday.)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1880 Alcott&rsquo;s British publisher suggested a revised version of Little Women, one that would not only
            eliminate quirks of New England regional language (the word quinydingles, for example, was changed to
            notions) but also reduce much of the slang terminology in general to provide for a more ladylike tone. (This
            1880 version is the one most readers today are familiar with, and it is used in the present Barnes &amp;
            Noble classics edition.) Notwithstanding such changes, critic Barrett Wendell in his 1900 Literary History
            of America still insists of Little Women, &ldquo;instead of unquestioning self-respect, its personages
            display that rude self-assertion which has generally tainted the lower middle class of English-speaking
            countries.&rdquo; It is a testament to Alcott&rsquo;s skill as a storyteller that the text still retains a
            youthful spirit of play and naturalness that the revision could not obscure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As such, this Alcott novel is no great fantasy, for even if the characters may seem outrageously obedient and
            good in a young twenty-first-century reader&rsquo;s mind, they exist in the realm of nineteenth-century
            possibilities. The March girls struggle with real problems&mdash;vanity, restraint, shyness, envy. In large
            part, the terms of their struggles make the difference. If pickled limes are no longer the forbidden vogue
            in school, as they are at Amy&lsquo;s, perhaps illegally downloaded MP3 files are. Although the restrictions
            on Jo&rsquo;s behavior and future doubtless are stronger than those today&rsquo;s teens face, Jo&rsquo;s
            choices demonstrate how she can begin to learn to live satisfactorily within those restrictions: She does
            marry, but we hope she only postpones her plans to travel the globe and her ambition to be a world-famous
            writer. Not every reader will view her compromise as positive, but young girls can still respond to
            Jo&rsquo;s dilemma with understanding and empathy. And today&rsquo;s young readers look to Little Women in
            particular, of course, to learn about what daily life might have been like for them had they lived in
            nineteenth-century America. Alcott&rsquo;s detailed lessons, in this regard, work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>More than many other children&rsquo;s novels, Little Women tends to compel commentators, female ones in
            particular, to discuss their own personal childhood impressions of the novel and how it affected their
            lives. This kind of retrospection in some ways can be frightening for what it reveals. Like many young
            girls, I was devoted to the book; I borrowed it from the library a few times a year and reread it
            obsessively in its entirety. (My mother eventually bought me a handsome illustrated hardcover edition, but
            it seemed somehow too pretty to mar through frequent use.) After my own childhood neuroses first helped me
            to identify in no small degree with Beth&rsquo;s painful, extreme shyness, Jo ultimately won my allegiance
            as my favorite character. She was the kind of girl I wanted to be: outspoken, possessed of big dreams, a bit
            of a tomboy. I fancifully saw television&rsquo;s nervous groundbreaker Mary Richards, from The Mary Tyler
            Moore Show&mdash; this character being a weekly combination of the petrified and the confident&mdash;as an
            adult Jo March for the 1970s (note, of course, Mary&rsquo;s perpetually single romantic status). I too was
            disappointed in Jo&rsquo;s choice of husband; I found Amy particularly annoying and liked Laurie very much.
            Later, I too was disappointed that Jo overcame her objections to marriage itself. I remember repeatedly
            feeling toward the book&rsquo;s end as though the plot had run away from me; I&rsquo;d gone along with
            everything up until the last few chapters. The book seemed to me to lose its charming day-by-day sense of
            detail once the marriage plots start weaving. The action speeds up dramatically, and the novel ends quickly
            following Jo&rsquo;s marriage. I think my frustration at the result ruined all marriage-plot novels for me
            forever&mdash;after the marriage, I observed, comes the end of the story. Whatever happens after, I thought,
            isn&rsquo;t even interesting enough to write down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If I were a young girl in 2004 reading Little Women for the first time, would I compare Jo to some of
            today&rsquo;s fictional teen heroines, such as Buffy Summers, of television&rsquo;s Buffy the Vampire
            Slayer? As teenage girls can now be seen on television annihilating demons with nigh impunity (after some
            natural concern, of course, over how this behavior will affect their popularity in high school&mdash;some
            things never change), Jo comes off as quaintly mundane at best, wimpy and suspiciously susceptible at worst.
            Yet it is curious, and in this context somehow appropriate, that the hugely popular series Buffy should
            reference the hugely popular novel Little Women directly. In one of the series&rsquo; last episodes, the
            town of Sunnydale&rsquo;s outwardly insipid yet inwardly demonic founder and former mayor, Richard Wilkins
            III (who, a few seasons previously, had transformed into a giant serpent and been blown up along with the
            high school on Buffy&rsquo;s graduation day), raises the topic of his favorite character in Little Women. He
            claims that most people would guess he&rsquo;d like Beth&mdash;for her easy-prey weakness, one supposes; but
            he instead prefers Meg, for her propriety and ladylike demeanor. Meg is clearly a contrast, one might say,
            to Buffy, the mayor&rsquo;s ass-kicking nemesis. Mayor Wilkins also fondly recalls a scene he treasures: the
            time Jo burns Meg&rsquo;s hair with a set of curling tongs. The reason why this commentary is so funny lies
            at the heart of recent critical debates about Alcott&rsquo;s most famous novel. What can Jo March offer
            young girls that heroines like Buffy Summers cannot&mdash;even after earlier marvels of powerful girlhood,
            such as Astrid Lindgren&rsquo;s 1950s super-strong heroine, Pippi Longstocking?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Much of Jo&rsquo;s charm and appeal lie in the idea that, unlike Buffy Summers, she is not a superhero
            (although Beth&rsquo;s goodness certainly appears superpowered). As Alcott writes toward the end of the
            novel, &ldquo;Jo wasn&rsquo;t a heroine, she was only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others, and
            she just acted out her nature.... She had often said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how
            hard; and now she had her wish, for what could be</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>more beautiful than to devote her life to Father and Mother, trying to make home as happy to them as they had
            to her? And if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for
            a restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for
            others?&rdquo; (p. 420). We note, of course, that Alcott made such sacrifices in her own life, and her
            point, although it may be hard to swallow, is that heroics come in both big and small proportions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Overall, then, how relevant can Little Women be to twenty-first-century youth? As Americans, for better or
            worse, remove themselves further from lifestyles like those of Alcott&rsquo;s close-knit community of
            charitable neighbors, is Little Women to be relegated to solely period-piece status&mdash;fine fodder for
            costume-drama films and small children&rsquo;s bedtime stories but not much else? Particularly following
            feminist critiques of Alcott&rsquo;s domestic novel, readers have been more vocal about finding it
            sentimental, even sometimes cloyingly sweet, by more modern standards. Yet it is a testament to
            Alcott&rsquo;s descriptive powers that though the family&rsquo;s shared activities may seem strange to a
            twenty-first-century audience, their utter sweetness and quaintness are in their own way rather stunning and
            just might provoke wistful feelings for a simpler kind of family life among even cynical
            readers&mdash;paradoxically just as the family&rsquo;s episodes of cloying togetherness may sometimes raise
            their gorge. We may wonder at how Beth, for example, could be so unnaturally shy as to dread being the
            center of attention at her own birthday parties&mdash;where members of her loving, indulgent family are the
            only guests! No matter how unrealistic or saccharine-sweet we may find Beth&rsquo;s goodness, many readers
            find it difficult to avoid tears at her fate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Other sequels in the March family saga followed Little Women and continued its popular tradition. The first,
            Little Men: Life at Plumfield with Jo&rsquo;s Boys (1871), describes events at the school Jo founds and the
            adventures of her diverse crew of pupils&mdash;all little boys, with the exception of Jo&rsquo;s nieces and
            the extremely naughty girl Nan, an even more tomboyish specimen than Jo herself had been as a child. The
            last book in the trilogy, Jo&rsquo;s Boys, and How They</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Turned Out (1886), would be Alcott&rsquo;s final novel, published only two years before the author&rsquo;s
            death. Written slowly, while Alcott was in poor health, the book centers on romance plots between the
            younger characters introduced in Little Men.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Several film adaptations of Little Women have appeared over the years, with appeals to successive generations
            of readers. Katharine Hepburn brought Jo so vividly to life in director George Cukor&rsquo;s classic 1933
            movie version (released only six years after the poll that found the novel more popular than the Bible) that
            Hepburn&rsquo;s particular brand of sharp New England eccentricity has been forever linked to that
            character. Her portrayal has colored critics&rsquo; judgments of other screen depictions of Jo&mdash;such as
            June Allyson&rsquo;s in the blander 1949 color version&mdash;and has set these later actors up for
            unwinnable comparisons. A more feminist film version of Little Women, from 1994, casts activist actor Susan
            Sarandon as Marmee, a very clear, pointed choice, and Winona Ryder, whose other roles many teen girl rebels
            have identified with, as a Jo March for the 1990s. This version also updates Professor Bhaer, doing the
            rumpled nineteenth-century scholar a tremendous favor by metamorphosing him into darkly handsome actor
            Gabriel Byrne.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>New to bookstore shelves as I write this introduction is novelist Katharine Weber&rsquo;s contemporary spin
            on the Marches&rsquo; story, titled The Little Women. Weber&rsquo;s third novel disrupts the sweet
            perseverance the girls demonstrate in Alcott&rsquo;s original. Here, the three New York City Green
            sisters&mdash;Margaret, Joanna, and Amy (Beth had been a doomed turtle)&mdash;find out via e-mail that their
            English-professor mother has been having an affair. They run away from home in disappointment and outrage
            after their father blandly forgives her, and the younger sisters move into Margaret&rsquo;s off-campus
            apartment at Yale University, where they try to set up an independent household. Weber even includes a
            lesbian subplot. Rather than employ a moralistic, Alcott-like omniscient narrator, Weber has Joanna tell the
            story from her perspective, with critical commentary in the form of &ldquo;readers&rsquo; notes&rdquo; from
            the other sisters. By granting the Green sisters a kind of divorce from their parents, Weber addresses the
            wishes of those readers who wanted alternative plots for Alcott&rsquo;s Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Although I
            haven&rsquo;t yet found one, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see an Internet site (like those that exist
            for pop-culture icons like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, for example) where Alcott admirers can post fan fiction
            they&rsquo;ve composed based on the original. In fact, this is a great idea. If we don&rsquo;t agree with
            the way Alcott handles the girls&rsquo; fates, we can take matters into our own hands&mdash;although we may
            find the task of creating an alternate universe as fully realized and as paradoxically timeless as Little
            Women&rsquo;s much more difficult than we&rsquo;d imagined.</p>

        <p>Playing Pilgrims</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Christmas won&rsquo;t be Christmas without any presents,&rdquo; grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so dreadful to be poor!&rdquo; sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls
            nothing at all,&rdquo; added little Amy, with an injured sniff.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got Father and Mother and each other,&rdquo; said Beth contentedly from her corner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo
            said sadly, &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got Father, and shall not have him for a long time.&rdquo; She
            didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;perhaps never,&rdquo; but each silently added it, thinking of Father far away, where
            the fighting was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, &ldquo;You know the reason Mother proposed not
            having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks
            we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. We can&rsquo;t do much,
            but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And
            Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think the little we should spend would do any good. We&rsquo;ve each got a agree not
            to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want to buy Undine and bookworm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>dollar, and the army wouldn&rsquo;t be much helped by our giving that. I Sintram<u><sup>a</sup></u> for
            myself. I&rsquo;ve wanted it so long,&rdquo; said Jo, who was a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I planned to spend mine in new music,&rdquo; said Beth, with a little sigh, which no one heard but the
            hearth brush and kettle holder.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall get a nice box of Faber&rsquo;s drawing pencils. I really need them,&rdquo; said Amy
            decidedly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother didn&rsquo;t say anything about our money, and she won&rsquo;t wish us to give up everything.
            Let&rsquo;s each buy what we want, and have a little fun, I&rsquo;m sure we work hard enough to earn
            it,&rdquo; cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know I do&mdash;teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I&rsquo;m longing to enjoy
            myself at home,&rdquo; began Meg, in the complaining tone again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have half such a hard time as I do,&rdquo; said Jo. &ldquo;How would you like to be
            shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries
            you till you&rsquo;re ready to fly out of the window or cry?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in
            the world. It makes me cross, and my hands get so stiff, I can&rsquo;t practice well at all.&rdquo; And Beth
            looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any of you suffer as I do,&rdquo; cried Amy, &ldquo;for you don&rsquo;t have to
            go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don&rsquo;t know your lessons, and laugh at your
            dresses, and label your father if he isn&rsquo;t rich, and insult you when your nose isn&rsquo;t
            nice.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you mean libel, I&rsquo;d say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa was a pickle bottle,&rdquo;
            advised Jo, laughing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know what I mean, and you needn&rsquo;t be statirical about it. It&rsquo;s proper to use good words,
            and improve your vocabilary,&rdquo; returned Amy, with dignity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t peck at one another, children. Don&rsquo;t you wish we had the money Papa lost when we
            were little, Jo? Dear me! how happy and good we&rsquo;d be, if we had no worries!&rdquo; said Meg, who could
            remember better times.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the King children, for they were
            fighting and fretting all the time, in spite of their money.&rdquo; &ldquo;So I did, Beth. Well, I think we
            are; for, though we do have to work, we make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would
            say.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo does use such slang words!&rdquo; observed Amy, with a reproving look at the long figure stretched
            on the rug. Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to whistle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&lsquo;t, Jo, it&rsquo;s so boyish!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I do it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I detest rude, unladylike girls!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Birds in their little nests agree,&rsquo; &rdquo; sang Beth, the peacemaker, with such a funny
            face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the &ldquo;pecking&rdquo; ended for that time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,&rdquo; said Meg, beginning to lecture in her elder-sisterly
            fashion. &ldquo;You are old enough to leave off boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It
            didn&rsquo;t matter so much when you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn up your hair, you
            should remember that you are a young lady.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I&rsquo;ll wear it in two tails till I&rsquo;m
            twenty,&rdquo; cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down a chestnut mane. &ldquo;I hate to think
            I&rsquo;ve got to grow up, and be Miss March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China aster!
            It&rsquo;s bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys&rsquo; games and work and manners! I
            can&rsquo;t get over my disappointment in not being a boy; and it&rsquo;s worse than ever now, for I&rsquo;m
            dying to go and fight with Papa, and I can only stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman!&rdquo; And Jo
            shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Poor Jo! It&rsquo;s too bad, but it can&rsquo;t be helped. So you must try to be contented with making
            your name boyish, and playing brother to us girls,&rdquo; said Beth, stroking the rough head at her knee
            with a hand that all the dishwashing and dusting in the world could not make ungen tle in its touch.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;As for you, Amy,&rdquo; continued Meg, &ldquo;you are altogether too particular and prim. Your airs
            are funny now, but you&rsquo;ll grow up an affected little goose, if you don&rsquo;t take care. I like your
            nice manners and refined ways of speaking, when you don&rsquo;t try to be elegant. But your absurd words are
            as bad as Jo&rsquo;s slang.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?&rdquo; asked Beth, ready to share the lecture.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear, and nothing else,&rdquo; answered Meg warmly; and no one contradicted her, for
            the &ldquo;Mouse&rdquo; was the pet of the family.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As young readers like to know &ldquo;how people look,&rdquo; we will take this moment to give them a little
            sketch of the four sisters, who sat knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly
            without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable old room, though the carpet was faded
            and the furniture very plain; for a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,
            chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded
            it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty
            of soft, brown hair, a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old Jo was
            very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with her
            long limbs, which were very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes,
            which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was
            her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, big
            hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly
            shooting up into a woman and didn&rsquo;t like it. Elizabeth&mdash;or Beth, as everyone called her&mdash;was
            a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful
            expression which was seldom disturbed. Her father called her &ldquo;Little Tranquillity,&rdquo; and the name
            suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own, only venturing out to meet the
            few whom she trusted and loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person&mdash;in her own
            opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her shoulders, pale and
            slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the
            four sisters were we will leave to be found out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm. Somehow the
            sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone brightened to
            welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked,
            and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They are quite worn out. Marmee must have a new pair.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d get her some with my dollar,&rdquo; said Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I shall!&rdquo; cried Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the oldest,&rdquo; began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the man of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for he told me to
            take special care of Mother while he was gone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said
            Beth, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s each get her something for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.&rdquo;
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like you, dear! What will we get?&rdquo; exclaimed Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her
            own pretty hands, &ldquo;I shall give her a nice pair of gloves.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Army shoes, best to be had,&rdquo; cried Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,&rdquo; said Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a little bottle of cologne. She likes it, and it won&rsquo;t cost much, so I&rsquo;ll
            have some left to buy my pencils,&rdquo; added Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How will we give the things?&rdquo; asked Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles. Don&rsquo;t you remember how we
            used to do on our birthdays?&rdquo; answered Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big chair with the crown on, and see you
            all come marching round to give the presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was
            dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,&rdquo; said Beth, who was toasting her
            face and the bread for tea at the same time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise her. We must go shopping
            tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so much to do about the play for Christmas night,&rdquo; said Jo, marching
            up and down, with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to act any more after this time. I&rsquo;m getting too old for such things,&rdquo;
            observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about &ldquo;dressing-up&rdquo; frolics.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down, and
            wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best actress we&rsquo;ve got, and there&rsquo;ll be an end of
            everything if you quit the boards,&rdquo;<u><sup>b</sup></u> said Jo. &ldquo;We ought to rehearse tonight.
            Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it; I never saw anyone faint, and I don&rsquo;t choose to make myself all black and
            blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down easily, I&rsquo;ll drop; if I can&lsquo;t, I shall fall into
            a chair and be graceful. I don&rsquo;t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,&rdquo; returned Amy, who
            was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by
            the villain of the piece.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do it this way: clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room, crying frantically, &lsquo;Roderigo!
            save me! save me!&rsquo;&rdquo; and away went Jo, with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked herself along as if she went by
            machinery, and her &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and
            anguish. Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread burn as she watched
            the fun with interest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don&rsquo;t
            blame me. Come on, Meg.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break;
            Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect;
            Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild
            &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best we&rsquo;ve had yet,&rdquo; said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his
            elbows.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You&rsquo;re a regular
            Shakespeare!&rdquo; exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius
            in all things.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; replied Jo modestly. &ldquo;I do think The Witch&rsquo;s Curse, an Operatic Tragedy
            is rather a nice thing, but I&rsquo;d like to try Macbeth, if we only had a trapdoor for
            Banquo.<u><sup>c</sup></u> I always wanted to do the killing part. &lsquo;Is that a dagger that I see before
            me?&rsquo; &rdquo;muttered Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian
            do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s the toasting fork, with Mother&rsquo;s shoe on it instead of the bread. Beth&rsquo;s
            stage-struck!&rdquo; cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Glad to find you so merry, my girls,&rdquo; said a cheery voice at the door, and actors and audience
            turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a &ldquo;can-I-help-you&rdquo; look about her which was truly
            delightful. She was not elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the gray cloak
            and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, dearies, how have you got on today? There was so much to do, getting the boxes ready to go
            tomorrow, that I didn&rsquo;t come home to dinner. Has anyone called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you
            look tired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off, her warm slippers on, and sitting
            down in the easy chair, drew Amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls
            flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg arranged the tea</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>table, Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping, overturning, and clattering everything she touched, Beth
            trotted to and fro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy gave directions to everyone, as she
            sat with her hands folded.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly happy face, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
            treat for you after supper.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit
            she held, and Jo tossed up her napkin, crying, &ldquo;A letter! a letter! Three cheers for Father!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we
            feared. He sends all sorts of loving wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,&rdquo; said
            Mrs. March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hurry and get done! Don&rsquo;t stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate,
            Amy,&rdquo; cried Jo, choking in her tea and dropping her bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her
            haste to get at the treat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come, till the
            others were ready.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think it was so splendid in Father to go as a chaplain when he was too old to be drafted, and not
            strong enough for a soldier,&rdquo; said Meg warmly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan<u><sup>d</sup></u>&mdash;what&rsquo;s its name? or
            a nurse, so I could be near him and help him,&rdquo; exclaimed Jo, with a groan.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of bad-tasting things, and drink
            out of a tin mug,&rdquo; sighed Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;When will he come home, Marmee?&rdquo; asked Beth, with a little quiver in her voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he
            can, and we won&rsquo;t ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the
            letter.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm
            of the chair, and Jo leaning on the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should
            happen to be touching. Very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching, especially
            those which fathers sent home. In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or
            the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life,
            marches, and military news, and only at the end did the writer&rsquo;s heart overflow with fatherly love and
            longing for the little girls at home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Give them all my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night, and
            find my best comfort in their affection at all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but
            remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days need not be wasted. I know they will
            remember all I said to them, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully, fight
            their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be
            fonder and prouder than ever of my little women.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Everybody sniffed when they came to that part; Jo wasn&rsquo;t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the
            end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother&rsquo;s
            shoulder and sobbed out, &ldquo;I am a selfish girl! but I&rsquo;ll truly try to be better, so he
            mayn&rsquo;t be disappointed in me by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We all will!&rdquo; cried Meg. &ldquo;I think too much of my looks and hate to work, but won&rsquo;t
            any more, if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and be what he loves to call me, &lsquo;a little woman,&rsquo; and not be rough and
            wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else,&rdquo; said Jo, thinking that keeping her
            temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might,
            losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all
            that Father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo&rsquo;s words, by saying in her cheery voice, &ldquo;Do you
            remember how you used to play Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress when you were little things?<u><sup>2</sup></u>
            Nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags<u><sup>e</sup></u> on your backs for burdens,
            give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the cellar, which was
            the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you could collect to
            make a Celestial City.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and passing through the Valley
            where the hobgoblins were!&rdquo; said Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled down stairs,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My favorite part was when we came out on the flat roof where our flowers and arbors and pretty things
            were, and all stood and sung for joy up there in the sunshine,&rdquo; said Beth, smiling, as if that
            pleasant moment had come back to her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry, and
            always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top. If I wasn&rsquo;t too old for such things, I&rsquo;d
            rather like to play it over again,&rdquo; said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the
            mature age of twelve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or
            another. Our burdens are here, our road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the
            guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true Celestial City. Now, my
            little pilgrims, suppose you begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get before
            Father comes home.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Really, Mother? Where are our bundles?&rdquo; asked Amy, who was a very literal young lady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather think she hasn&rsquo;t got
            any,&rdquo; said her mother.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have. Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice pianos, and being afraid of
            people.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth&rsquo;s bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, but nobody did, for it would have
            hurt her feelings very much.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Let us do it,&rdquo; said Meg thoughtfully. &ldquo;It is only another name for trying to be good, and
            the story may help us; for though we do want to be good, it&rsquo;s hard work and we forget, and don&rsquo;t
            do our best.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and pulled us out as Help did in the book.
            We ought to have our roll of directions, like Christian. What shall we do about that?&rdquo; asked Jo,
            delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Look under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find your guidebook,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
            March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then out came the four little workbaskets,
            and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but tonight no
            one grumbled. They adopted Jo&rsquo;s plan of dividing the long seams into four parts, and calling the
            quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they talked
            about the different countries as they stitched their way through them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed. No one but Beth could get much music
            out of the old piano, but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant
            accompaniment to the simple songs they sang. Meg had a voice like a flute, and she and her mother led the
            little choir. Amy chirped like a cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always
            coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune. They had always
            done this from the time they could lisp and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born
            singer. The first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark, and
            the last sound at night was</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the same cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Crinkle, crinkle, &lsquo;ittle &rsquo;tar,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A Merry Christmas</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a
            moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because it was so
            crammed with goodies. Then she remembered her mother&rsquo;s promise and, slipping her hand under her
            pillow, drew out a little crimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful old story
            of the best life ever lived,<u><sup>f</sup></u> and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim
            going the long journey. She woke Meg with a &ldquo;Merry Christmas,&rdquo; and bade her see what was under
            her pillow. A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few words written by their
            mother, which made their one present very precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage and
            find their little books also&mdash;one dove-colored, the other blue&mdash;and all sat looking at and talking
            about them, while the east grew rosy with the coming day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature, which unconsciously influenced her
            sisters, especially Jo, who loved her very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little
            nightcapped ones in the room beyond, &ldquo;Mother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and we
            must begin at once. We used to be faithful about it, but since Father went away and all this war trouble
            unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you please, but I shall keep my book on the table
            here and read a little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good and help me through
            the day.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read
            also, with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let&rsquo;s do as they do. I&rsquo;ll help you with the hard words, and
            they&rsquo;ll explain things if we don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; whispered Beth, very much impressed by the
            pretty books and her sisters&rsquo; example.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad mine is blue,&rdquo; said Amy. And then the rooms were very still while the pages were
            softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas
            greeting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where is Mother?&rdquo; asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for their gifts, half an hour
            later.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter come a-beggin&lsquo;, and your ma went straight off to see what
            was needed. There never was such a woman for givin&rsquo; away vittles and drink, clothes and
            firin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by
            them all more as a friend than a servant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything ready,&rdquo; said Meg, looking
            over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the
            proper time. &ldquo;Why, where is Amy&rsquo;s bottle of cologne?&rdquo; she added, as the little flask did
            not appear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on it, or some such notion,&rdquo;
            replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How nice my handkerchiefs look, don&rsquo;t they? Hannah washed and ironed them for me, and I marked
            them all myself,&rdquo; said Beth, looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such
            labor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bless the child! She&rsquo;s gone and put &lsquo;Mother&rsquo; on them instead of &rsquo;M.
            March.&rsquo; How funny!&rdquo; cried Jo, taking up one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg&rsquo;s initials are M. M., and
            I don&rsquo;t want anyone to use these but Marmee,&rdquo; said Beth, looking troubled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, dear, and a very pretty idea&mdash;quite sensible, too, for no one can ever
            mistake now. It will please her very much, I know,&rdquo; said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for
            Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mother. Hide the basket, quick!&rdquo; cried Jo, as a door slammed and steps sounded in
            the hall.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?&rdquo; asked Meg, surprised to see, by her
            hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so early.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh at me, Jo! I didn&rsquo;t mean anyone should know till the time came. I only meant
            to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave all my money to get it, and I&rsquo;m truly trying not
            to be selfish any more.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one, and looked so earnest and humble in
            her little effort to forget herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her &ldquo;a
            trump,&rdquo;<u><sup>g</sup></u> while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to ornament the
            stately bottle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about being good this morning, so I
            ran round the corner and changed it the minute I was up: and I&rsquo;m so glad, for mine is the hand somest
            now.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the girls to the table, eager for
            breakfast.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books; we read some, and mean to every
            day,&rdquo; they cried, in chorus.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, little daughters! I&rsquo;m glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on. But I
            want to say one word before we sit down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn
            baby. Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire. There is nothing
            to eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will
            you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a minute no one spoke&mdash;only a
            minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you came before we began!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?&rdquo; asked Beth eagerly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall take the cream and the muffins,&rdquo; added Amy, heroically giving up the articles she most
            liked.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one big plate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d do it,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. &ldquo;You shall all go
            and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and milk for</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was early, and they went through back
            streets, so few people saw them, and no one laughed at the queer party.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire, ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing
            baby, and a group of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in!</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ach, mein Gott!<u><sup>h</sup></u> It is good angels come to us!&rdquo; said the poor woman, crying
            for joy.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Funny angels in hoods and mittens,&rdquo; said Jo, and set them laughing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there. Hannah, who had carried wood,
            made a fire, and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother tea
            and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it
            had been her own. The girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and fed them like so
            many hungry birds &mdash;laughing, talking, and trying to understand the funny broken English.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Das ist gut!&rdquo; &ldquo;Die Engel-kinder!&rdquo; <u><sup>i</sup></u> cried the poor things as they
            ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable, especially Jo, who had
            been considered a &ldquo;Sancho&rdquo;<u><sup>j</sup></u> ever since she was born. That was a very happy
            breakfast, though they didn&rsquo;t get any of it; and when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think
            there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their
            breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,&rdquo; said Meg, as they set
            out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles, and the tall
            vase of red roses, white chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave quite an
            elegant air to the table.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for Marmee!&rdquo; cried Jo,
            prancing about while Meg went to conduct Mother to the seat of honor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted escort with great dignity. Mrs. March
            was both surprised and touched, and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the
            little notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new handkerchief was slipped into her
            pocket, well scented with Amy&rsquo;s cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were
            pronounced a &ldquo;perfect fit.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the simple, loving fashion which makes these
            home festivals so pleasant at the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations
            for the evening festivities. Being still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to afford
            any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their wits to work, and&mdash;necessity being the
            mother of invention&mdash;made whatever they needed. Very clever were some of their
            productions&mdash;pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats covered with silver
            paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered
            with the same useful diamond-shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of tin preserve pots were cut out. The
            furniture was used to being turned topsy-turvy, and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No gentlemen were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her heart&rsquo;s content and took immense
            satisfaction in a pair of russet-leather boots given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor.
            These boots, an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture, were Jo&rsquo;s
            chief treasures and appeared on all occasions. The smallness of the company made it necessary for the two
            principal actors to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work
            they did in learning three or four different parts, whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing
            the stage besides. It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and employed many hours
            which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle, and sat before the blue and
            yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling and
            whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get
            hysterical in the excitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew apart, and the
            Operatic Tragedy began.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A gloomy wood,&rdquo; according to the one playbill, was represented by a few shrubs in pots, green
            baize<u><sup>k</sup></u> on the floor, and a cave in the distance. This cave was made with a
            clotheshorse<u><sup>l</sup></u> for a roof, bureaus for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast,
            with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had
            a fine effect, especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment
            was allowed for the first thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with a clanking sword at his
            side, a slouched hat, black beard, mysterious cloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much
            agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his hatred to Roderigo, his
            love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of
            Hugo&rsquo;s voice, with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive, and the
            audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise,
            he stole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding, &ldquo;What ho, minion! I need
            thee!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red and black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs
            upon her cloak. Hugo demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in a fine
            dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love
            philter:<u><sup>m</sup></u></p>
        <p>Hither, hither, from thy home,</p>
        <p>Airy sprite, I bid thee come!</p>
        <p>Born of roses, fed on dew,</p>
        <p>Charms and potions canst thou brew?</p>
        <p>Bring me here, with elfin speed,</p>
        <p>The fragrant philter which I need;</p>
        <p>Make it sweet and swift and strong,</p>
        <p>Spirit, answer now my song!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white,
            with glittering wings, golden hair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang, And dropping
            a small, gilded bottle at the witch&rsquo;s feet, the spirit vanished. Another chant from Hagar produced
            another apparition&mdash;not a lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having croaked a
            reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>disappeared with a mocking laugh. Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots, Hugo departed,
            and Hagar informed the audience that, as he had killed a few of her friends in times past, she has cursed
            him, and intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain fell, and the audience
            reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hither I come,</p>
        <p>From my airy home,</p>
        <p>Afar in the silver moon.</p>
        <p>Take the magic spell,</p>
        <p>And use it well,</p>
        <p>Or its power will vanish soon!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again, but when it became evident what a masterpiece
            of stage carpentering had been got up, no one murmured at the delay. It was truly superb! A tower rose to
            the ceiling; halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning at it, and behind the white curtain appeared
            Zara in a lovely blue and silver dress, waiting for Roderigo. He came in gorgeous array, with plumed cap,
            red cloak, chestnut lovelocks,<u><sup>n</sup></u> a guitar, and the boots, of course. Kneeling at the foot
            of the tower, he sang a serenade in melting tones. Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented to
            fly. Then came the grand effect of the play. Roderigo produced a rope ladder, with five steps to it, threw
            up one end, and invited Zara to descend. Timidly she crept from her lattice, put her hand on
            Roderigo&rsquo;s shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when &ldquo;Alas! alas for Zara!&rdquo; she
            forgot her train&mdash;it caught in the window, the tower tottered, leaned forward, fell with a crash, and
            buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged,
            exclaiming, &ldquo;I told you so! I told you so!&rdquo; With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the
            cruel sire, rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh! Act as if it was all right!&rdquo;&mdash;and, ordering Roderigo up, banished him
            from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly shaken by the fall of the tower upon him, Roderigo
            defied the old gentleman and refused to stir. This dauntless example fired Zara: she also defied her sire,
            and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle. A stout little retainer came in with chains
            and led them away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having come to free the lovers and finish Hugo. She
            hears him coming and hides, sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little servant,
            &ldquo;Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I shall come anon.&rdquo; The servant takes
            Hugo aside to tell him something, and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless. Ferdi nando,
            the &ldquo;minion,&rdquo; carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for
            Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty after a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and after a good deal of
            clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar informs him what she has done in a song of
            exquisite power and melody.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a
            quantity of long hair rather marred the effect of the villain&rsquo;s death. He was called before the
            curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing was considered more wonderful than
            all the rest of the performance put together.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that
            Zara has deserted him. Just as the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window, informing
            him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can save her if he will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks the
            door, and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his ladylove.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He wishes her to go into a convent, but she
            won&rsquo;t hear of it and, after a touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in and demands
            her hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot
            agree, and Roderigo is about to bear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a letter
            and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared. The latter informs the party that she bequeaths
            untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn&rsquo;t make them happy. The bag
            is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the
            glitter. This entirely softens the &ldquo;stern sire.&rdquo; He consents without a murmur, all join in a
            joyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro&rsquo;s blessing in
            attitudes of the most romantic grace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check, for the cot bed, on which the &ldquo;dress
            circle&rdquo; was built, suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don Pedro
            flew to the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless with laughter. The excitement
            had hardly subsided when Hannah appeared, with &ldquo;Mrs. March&rsquo;s compliments, and would the ladies
            walk down to supper.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table, they looked at one another in rapturous
            amazement. It was like Marmee to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine as this was unheard of
            since the departed days of plenty. There was ice cream&mdash;actually two dishes of it, pink and
            white&mdash;and cake and fruit and distracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four great
            bouquets of hothouse flowers!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It quite took their breath away; and they stared first at the table and then at their mother, who looked as
            if she enjoyed it immensely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is it fairies?&rdquo; asked Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Santa Claus,&rdquo; said Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother did it.&rdquo; And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper,&rdquo; cried Jo, with a sudden inspiration.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it,&rdquo; replied Mrs. March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The Laurence boy&rsquo;s grandfather! What in the world put such a thing into his head? We don&rsquo;t
            know him!&rdquo; exclaimed Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an odd old gentleman, but that
            pleased him. He knew my father years ago, and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I
            would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of
            the day. I could not refuse, and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk
            breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That boy put it into his head, I know he did! He&rsquo;s a capital fellow, and I wish we could get
            acquainted. He looks as if he&rsquo;d like to know us but he&rsquo;s bashful, and Meg is so prim she
            won&rsquo;t let me speak to him when we pass,&rdquo; said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to
            melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked one of the
            girls. &ldquo;My mother knows old Mr. Laurence, but says he&rsquo;s very proud and doesn&rsquo;t like to mix
            with his neighbors. He keeps his grandson shut up, when he isn&rsquo;t riding or walking with his tutor, and
            makes him study very hard. We invited him to our party, but he didn&rsquo;t come. Mother says he&rsquo;s
            very nice, though he never speaks to us girls.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the fence, and were getting on
            capitally&mdash;all about cricket, and so on&mdash;when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know
            him some day, for he needs fun, I&rsquo;m sure he does,&rdquo; said Jo decidedly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman; so I&rsquo;ve no objection to your knowing
            him, if a proper opportunity comes. He brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him in, if I had
            been sure what was going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away, hearing the frolic and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>evidently having none of his own.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mercy you didn&lsquo;t, Mother!&rdquo; laughed Jo, looking at her boots. &ldquo;But
            we&rsquo;ll have another play sometime that he can see. Perhaps he&rsquo;ll help act. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be
            jolly?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is!&rdquo; And Meg examined her flowers with
            great interest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They are lovely! But Beth&rsquo;s roses are sweeter to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, smelling the
            half-dead posy in her belt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, &ldquo;I wish I could send my bunch to Father. I&rsquo;m afraid
            he isn&rsquo;t having such a merry Christ mas as we are.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Laurence Boy</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo! Jo! Where are you?&rdquo; cried Meg at the foot of the garret stairs. &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; answered a
            husky voice from above, and, running up,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, <u><sup>o</sup></u> wrapped up in a
            comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window. This was Jo&rsquo;s favorite refuge; and here she
            loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat
            who lived near by and didn&rsquo;t mind her a particle. As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo
            shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Such fun! Only see! A regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for tomorrow night!&rdquo; cried
            Meg, waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss josephine<u><sup>p</sup></u> at a
            little dance on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.&rsquo; Marmee is willing we should go, now what shall we wear?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins, because we haven&rsquo;t
            got anything else?&rdquo; answered Jo with her mouth full. &ldquo;If I only had a silk!&rdquo; sighed Meg.
            &ldquo;Mother says I may when I&rsquo;m eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to
            wait.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us. Yours is as good as new, but
            I forgot the burn and the tear in mine. Whatever shall I do? The burn shows badly, and I can&rsquo;t take
            any out.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight; the front is all right. I shall have a
            new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and my
            gloves will do, though they aren&rsquo;t as nice as I&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can&rsquo;t get any new ones, so I shall have to go
            without,&rdquo; said Jo, who never troubled herself much about dress.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You must have gloves, or I won&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; cried Meg decidedly. &ldquo;Gloves are more
            important than anything else; you can&rsquo;t dance without them, and if you don&rsquo;t I should be so
            mortified.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll stay still. I don&rsquo;t care much for company dancing. It&rsquo;s no fun to go
            sailing round. I like to fly about and cut capers.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are so careless. She said when
            you spoiled the others that she shouldn&rsquo;t get you any more this winter. Can&rsquo;t you make them
            do?&rdquo; asked Meg anxiously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how stained they are; that&rsquo;s all I
            can do. No! I&rsquo;ll tell you how we can manage&mdash;each wear one good one and carry a bad one.
            Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove dreadfully,&rdquo; began Meg, whose
            gloves were a tender point with her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go without. I don&rsquo;t care what people say!&rdquo; cried Jo, taking up her book.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You may have it, you may! Only don&rsquo;t stain it, and do behave nicely. Don&rsquo;t put your hands
            behind you, or stare, or say &lsquo;Christopher Columbus!&rsquo; will you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;ll be as prim as I can and not get into any scrapes, if I can help
            it. Now go and answer your note, and let me finish this splendid story.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So Meg went away to &ldquo;accept with thanks,&rdquo; look over her dress, and sing blithely as she did up
            her one real lace frill, while Jo finished her story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with
            Scrabble.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On New Year&rsquo;s Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two
            elder were absorbed in the all-important business of &ldquo;getting ready for the party.&rdquo; Simple as
            the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing and talking, and at one time a
            strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to
            pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ought they to smoke like that?&rdquo; asked Beth from her perch on the bed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dampness drying,&rdquo; replied Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What a queer smell! It&rsquo;s like burned feathers,&rdquo; observed Amy, smoothing her own pretty
            curls with a superior air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There, now I&rsquo;ll take off the papers and you&rsquo;ll see a cloud of little ringlets,&rdquo; said
            Jo, putting down the tongs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the hair came with the papers, and the
            horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, oh! What have you done? I&rsquo;m spoiled! I can&rsquo;t go! My hair, oh, my hair!&rdquo;
            wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just my luck! You shouldn&rsquo;t have asked me to do it. I always spoil everything. I&rsquo;m so
            sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I&rsquo;ve made a mess,&rdquo; groaned poor Jo, regarding the
            black pancakes with tears of regret.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t spoiled; just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit,
            and it will look like the latest fashion. I&rsquo;ve seen many girls do it so,&rdquo; said Amy consolingly.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I&rsquo;d let my hair alone,&rdquo; cried Meg
            petulantly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again,&rdquo; said Beth, coming to
            kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the united exertions of the family Jo&rsquo;s
            hair was got up and her dress on. They looked very well in their simple suits&mdash;Meg in silvery
            drab,<u><sup>q</sup></u> with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin; Jo in maroon, with a
            stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one
            nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect &ldquo;quite easy and
            fine.&rdquo; Meg&rsquo;s high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt her, though she would not own it, and
            Jo&rsquo;s nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable;
            but, dear me, let us be elegant or die!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Have a good time, dearies!&rdquo; said Mrs. March, as the sisters went daintily down the walk.
            &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat much supper, and come away at eleven when I send Hannah for you.&rdquo; As the gate
            clashed behind them, a voice cried from a window&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Girls, girls! have you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, spandy nice,<u><sup>r</sup></u> and Meg has cologne on hers,&rdquo; cried Jo, adding with a
            laugh as they went on, &ldquo;I do believe Marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an
            earthquake.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady is always known by neat boots,
            gloves, and handkerchief,&rdquo; replied Meg, who had a good many little &ldquo;aristocratic tastes&rdquo;
            of her own.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t forget to keep the bad breadth<u><sup>s</sup></u> out of sight, Jo. Is my sash right?
            And does my hair look very bad?&rdquo; said Meg, as she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s
            dressing room after a prolonged prink. <u><sup>t</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind me by a wink, will you?&rdquo;
            returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, winking isn&rsquo;t ladylike. I&rsquo;ll lift my eyebrows if anything is wrong, and nod if you are
            all right. Now hold your shoulders straight, and take short steps, and don&rsquo;t shake hands if you are
            introduced to anyone: it isn&rsquo;t the thing.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How do you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn&rsquo;t that music gay?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties, and, informal as this little
            gathering was, it was an event to them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and handed
            them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who
            didn&rsquo;t care much for girls or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall,
            and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden. Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about
            skates in another part of the room, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of
            her life. She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir.
            No one came to talk to her, and one by one the group near her dwindled away till she was left alone. She
            could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth would show, so she stared at people rather
            forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly
            that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big redheaded youth
            approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending
            to peep and enjoy herself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for,
            as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face to face with the &ldquo;Laurence boy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dear me, I didn&rsquo;t know anyone was here!&rdquo; stammered Jo, preparing to back out as speedily
            as she had bounced in. But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little startled,
            &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me, stay if you like.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t I disturb you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a bit. I only came here because I don&rsquo;t know many people and felt rather strange at first,
            you know.&rdquo; &ldquo;So did I. Don&rsquo;t go away, please, unless you&rsquo;d rather.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps,<u><sup>u</sup></u> till Jo said, trying to be polite and
            easy, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of seeing you before. You live near us, don&rsquo;t
            you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Next door.&rdquo; And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo&rsquo;s prim manner was rather funny
            when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her heartiest way, &ldquo;We did have such a
            good time over your nice Christmas present.&rdquo; &ldquo;Grandpa sent it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But you put it into his head, didn&rsquo;t you, now?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How is your cat, Miss March?&rdquo; asked the boy, trying to look sober while his black eyes shone
            with fun.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence; but I am not Miss March, I&rsquo;m only Jo,&rdquo; returned the young
            lady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Mr. Laurence, I&rsquo;m only Laurie.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Laurie Laurence&mdash;what an odd name!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My first name is Theodore, but I don&rsquo;t like it, for the fellows called me Dora, so I made them
            say Laurie instead.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hate my name, too&mdash;so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo instead of Josephine. How did
            you make the boys stop calling you Dora?&rdquo; &ldquo;I thrashed &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.&rdquo; And Jo resigned herself
            with a sigh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like to dance, Miss Jo?&rdquo; asked Laurie, looking as if he thought the name suited
            her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is lively. In a place like this
            I&rsquo;m sure to upset something, tread on people&rsquo;s toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of
            mischief and let Meg sail about. Don&rsquo;t you dance?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Sometimes. You see I&rsquo;ve been abroad a good many years, and haven&rsquo;t been into company
            enough yet to know how you do things here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Abroad!&rdquo; cried Jo. &ldquo;Oh, tell me about
            it! I love dearly to hear people describe their travels.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Laurie didn&rsquo;t seem to know where to begin, but Jo&rsquo;s eager questions soon set him going, and he
            told her how he had been at school in Vevay,<u><sup>v</sup></u> where the boys never wore hats and had a
            fleet of boats on the lake, and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I wish I&rsquo;d been there!&rdquo; cried Jo. &ldquo;Did you go to Paris?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We spent last winter there.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Can you talk French?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do say some! I can read it, but can&rsquo;t pronounce.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?&rdquo; said Laurie good-naturedly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How nicely you do it! Let me see&mdash;you said, &lsquo;Who is the young lady in the pretty
            slippers,&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oui, mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she is pretty?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and quiet, and dances like a
            lady.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both
            peeped and criticized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie&rsquo;s bashfulness soon
            wore off, for Jo&rsquo;s gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self
            again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the
            &ldquo;Laurence boy&rdquo; better than ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe
            him to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown creatures to
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine teeth, small hands and feet, taller
            than I am, very polite, for a boy, and altogether jolly. Wonder how old he is?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was on the tip of Jo&rsquo;s tongue to ask, but she checked herself in time and, with unusual tact, tried
            to find out in a roundabout way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away at your books&mdash;no, I mean
            studying hard.&rdquo; And Jo blushed at the dreadful &ldquo;pegging&rdquo; which had escaped her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie smiled but didn&rsquo;t seem shocked, and answered with a shrug, &ldquo;Not for a year or two; I
            won&rsquo;t go before seventeen, anyway.&rdquo; &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you but fifteen?&rdquo; asked Jo,
            looking at the tall lad, whom she had imagined seventeen already. &ldquo;Sixteen, next month.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How I wish I was going to college! You don&rsquo;t look as if you liked it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking.<u><sup>w</sup></u> And I don&rsquo;t like the way
            fellows do either, in this country.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you like?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit
            them, so she changed the subject by saying, as her foot kept time, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a splendid polka! Why
            don&rsquo;t you go and try it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you will come too,&rdquo; he answered, with a gallant little bow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t; for I told Meg I wouldn&lsquo;t, because&mdash;&rdquo; There Jo stopped, and looked
            undecided whether to tell or to laugh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Because what?&rdquo; asked Laurie curiously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my frocks, and I scorched this
            one, and though it&rsquo;s nicely mended, it shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it.
            You may laugh, if you want to. It is funny, I know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Laurie didn&rsquo;t laugh; he only looked down a minute, and the expression of his face puzzled Jo when
            he said very gently, &ldquo;Never mind that; I&rsquo;ll tell you how we can manage: there&rsquo;s a long
            hall out there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves, when she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones
            her partner wore. The hall was empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught her the
            German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring. When the music stopped, they sat down on
            the stairs to get their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students&rsquo; festival at
            Heidelberg<u><sup>x</sup></u> when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and Jo reluctantly
            followed her into a side room, where she found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench. It aches so, I
            can hardly stand, and I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m ever going to get home,&rdquo; she said, rocking to
            and fro in pain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I&rsquo;m sorry. But I don&rsquo;t see what
            you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all night,&rdquo; answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle
            as she spoke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have a carriage without its costing ever so much. I dare say I can&rsquo;t get one at
            all, for most people come in their own, and it&rsquo;s a long way to the stable, and no one to send.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, indeed! It&rsquo;s past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can&rsquo;t stop here, for the house is full.
            Sallie has some girls staying with her. I&rsquo;ll rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I
            can.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask Laurie; he will go,&rdquo; said Jo, looking relieved as the idea occurred to her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mercy, no! Don&rsquo;t ask or tell anyone. Get me my rubbers,<u><sup>y</sup></u> and put these
            slippers with our things. I can&rsquo;t dance any more, but as soon as supper is over, watch for Hannah and
            tell me the minute she comes.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They are going out to supper now. I&rsquo;ll stay with you; I&rsquo;d rather.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I&rsquo;m so tired, I can&rsquo;t stir!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away to the dining room, which she found
            after going into a china closet, and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little
            private refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee, which she immediately spilled,
            thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg&rsquo;s glove by scrubbing her
            gown with it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; said a friendly voice. And there was Laurie, with a full cup in one hand and a
            plate of ice in the other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and someone shook me, and here I am in a
            nice state,&rdquo; answered Jo, glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Too bad! I was looking for someone to give this to. May I take it to your sister?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you! I&rsquo;ll show you where she is. I won&rsquo;t offer to take it myself, for I should
            only get into another scrape if I did.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a little table, brought a second
            installment of coffee and ice for Jo, and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a
            &ldquo;nice boy.&rdquo; They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the midst of a quiet
            game of &ldquo;Buzz,&rdquo; with two or three other young people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared.
            Meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation of
            pain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hush! Don&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; she whispered, adding aloud, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I
            turned my foot a little, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; and limped upstairs to put her things on.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits&rsquo; end, till she decided to take things into her own
            hands. Slipping out, she ran down and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It happened
            to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie,
            who had heard what she said, came up and offered his grandfather&rsquo;s carriage, which had just come for
            him, he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so early! You can&rsquo;t mean to go yet?&rdquo; began Jo, looking relieved but hesitating
            to accept the offer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I always go early&mdash;I do, truly! Please let me take you home. It&rsquo;s all on my way, you know,
            and it rains, they say.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That settled it; and, telling him of Meg&rsquo;s mishap, Jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down
            the rest of the party. Hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they rolled away
            in the luxurious closed carriage, feeling very festive and elegant. Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep
            her foot up, and the girls talked over their party in freedom.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I had a capital time. Did you?&rdquo; asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and making herself comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie&rsquo;s friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to me, and asked me to come
            and spend a week with her when Sallie does. She is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be
            perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go,&rdquo; answered Meg, cheering up at the thought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I saw you dancing with the redheaded man I ran away from. Was he nice?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, very! His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very polite, and I had a delicious
            redowa<u><sup>z</sup></u> with him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step. Laurie and I couldn&rsquo;t help
            laughing. Did you hear us?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, but it was very rude. What were you about all that time, hidden
            away there?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they were at home. With many thanks, they said good
            night and crept in, hoping to disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two little nightcaps
            bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tell about the party! tell about the party!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With what Meg called &ldquo;a great want of manners,&rdquo; Jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls;
            and they soon subsided, after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home from the party in a carriage and
            sit in my dressing gown with a maid to wait on me,&rdquo; said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with
            arnica<u><sup>aa</sup></u> and brushed her hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do, in spite of our burned
            hair, old gowns, one glove apiece, and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to
            wear them.&rdquo; And I think Jo was quite right.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>4</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Burdens</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,&rdquo; sighed Meg the morning after the
            party, for, now the holidays were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the
            task she never liked.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish it was Christmas or New Year&rsquo;s all the time. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun?&rdquo; answered
            Jo, yawning dismally.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does seem so nice to have little
            suppers and bouquets, and go to parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It&rsquo;s like
            other people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things, I&rsquo;m so fond of luxury,&rdquo; said
            Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t have it, so don&rsquo;t let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along
            as cheerfully as Marmee does. I&rsquo;m sure Aunt March is a regular Old Man of the Sea<u><sup>ab</sup></u>
            to me, but I suppose when I&rsquo;ve learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get
            so light that I shan&rsquo;t mind her.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This idea tickled Jo&rsquo;s fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg didn&rsquo;t brighten, for her
            burden, consisting of four spoiled children, seemed heavier than ever. She hadn&rsquo;t heart enough even to
            make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming
            way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares
            whether I&rsquo;m pretty or not?&rdquo; she muttered, shutting her drawer with a jerk. &ldquo;I shall have
            to toil and moil<u><sup>ac</sup></u> all my days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and
            ugly and sour, because I&rsquo;m poor and can&rsquo;t enjoy my life as other girls do. It&rsquo;s a
            shame!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn&rsquo;t at all agreeable at breakfast time. Everyone
            seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak. Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort
            herself with the cat and three kittens; Amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned, and she
            couldn&rsquo;t find her rubbers; Jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready; Mrs. March was very
            busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at once; and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late
            didn&rsquo;t suit her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There never was such a cross family!&rdquo; cried Jo, losing her temper when she had upset an
            inkstand, broken both boot lacings, and sat down upon her hat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the crossest person in it!&rdquo; returned Amy, washing out the sum that was all wrong
            with the tears that had fallen on her slate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Beth, if you don&rsquo;t keep these horrid cats down cellar I&rsquo;ll have them drowned,&rdquo;
            exclaimed Meg angrily, as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like
            a burr just out of reach.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because she couldn&rsquo;t remember how much nine
            times twelve was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute! I must get this off by the early mail, and you drive me
            distracted with your worry,&rdquo; cried Mrs. March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two hot turnovers on the table, and
            stalked out again. These turnovers were an institution, and the girls called them &ldquo;muffs,&rdquo; for
            they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings. Hannah never
            forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy she might be, for the walk was long and bleak; the poor
            things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy. Good-by, Marmee. We are a set of rascals this
            morning, but we&rsquo;ll come home regular angels.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now then, Meg!&rdquo; And Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to
            do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was always at the window to nod and
            smile, and wave her hand to them. Somehow it seemed as if they couldn&rsquo;t have got through the day
            without that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect
            them like sunshine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would serve us right, for more
            ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen,&rdquo; cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the
            snowy walk and bitter wind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use such dreadful expressions,&rdquo; said Meg from the depths of the veil in which she
            had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I like good strong words that mean something,&rdquo; replied Jo, catching her hat as it took a leap
            off her head preparatory to flying away altogether. &ldquo;Call yourself any names you like, but I am
            neither a rascal nor a wretch and I don&rsquo;t choose to be called so.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you can&rsquo;t sit in the lap of
            luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait till I make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice
            cream and high-heeled slippers and posies and redheaded boys to dance with.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How ridiculous you are, Jo!&rdquo; But Meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of
            herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried to be dismal, as you do, we should be in a
            nice state. Thank goodness, I can always find something funny to keep me up. Don&rsquo;t croak any more, but
            come home jolly, there&rsquo;s a dear.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day, each going a different way,
            each hugging her little warm turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather, hard work,
            and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend, the two oldest girls begged to be
            allowed to do something toward their own support, at least. Believing that they could not begin too early to
            cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents consented, and both fell to work with the hearty
            good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last. Margaret found a place as nursery
            governess and felt rich with her small salary. As she said, she was &ldquo;fond of luxury,&rdquo; and her
            chief trouble was poverty. She found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time
            when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown. She tried not to be
            envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay
            friends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings&rsquo; she daily saw all she wanted, for the
            children&rsquo;s older sisters were just out,<u><sup>ad</sup></u> and Meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty
            ball dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymak
            ings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her. Poor Meg
            seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she had not
            yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her. The childless old
            lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her offer
            was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich
            old lady&rsquo;s will, but the unworldly Marches only said&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will keep together and be
            happy in one another.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old lady wouldn&rsquo;t speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo at a friend&lsquo;s, something
            in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old lady&rsquo;s fancy, and she proposed to take her for a
            companion. This did not suit Jo at all, but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and, to
            every one&rsquo;s surprise, got on remarkably well with her irascible relative. There was an occasional
            tempest, and once Jo had marched home, declaring she couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer; but Aunt March
            always cleared up quickly, and sent for her back again with such urgency that she could not refuse, for in
            her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books, which was left to dust and spiders
            since Uncle March died. Jo remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and
            bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about the queer pictures in his Latin books, and buy her
            cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down
            from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and, best of all, the wilderness of books in which she
            could wander where she liked, made the library a region of bliss to her. The moment Aunt March took her nap,
            or was busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and, curling herself up in the easy chair,
            devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and pictures, like a regular bookworm. But, like all happiness,
            it did not last long; for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story, the sweetest verse of the
            song, or the most perilous adventure of her traveler, a shrill voice called, &ldquo;Josy-phine!
            Josy-phine!&rdquo; and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the poodle, or read Belsham&rsquo;s
            Essays<u><sup>ae</sup></u> by the hour together.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo&rsquo;s ambition was to do something very splendid; what it was she had no idea as yet, but left it for
            time to tell her; and, meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn&rsquo;t read,
            run, and ride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless spirit were always getting
            her into scrapes, and her life was a series of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the
            training she received at Aunt March&rsquo;s was just what she needed, and the thought that she was doing
            something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual &ldquo;Josy-phine!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth was too bashful to go to school; it had been tried, but she suffered so much that it was given up, and
            she did her lessons at home with her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was called to devote her
            skill and energy to Soldiers&rsquo; Aid Societies, Beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she
            could. She was a housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the
            workers, never thinking of any reward but to be loved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for
            her little world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy bee. There were six dolls
            to be taken up and dressed every morning, for Beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever. Not
            one whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them in; for, when her sisters
            outgrew these idols, they passed to her because Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all
            the more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm dolls. No pins were ever stuck into
            their cotton vitals, no harsh words or blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the heart of the
            most repulsive; but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed. One
            forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to Jo and, having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in the
            rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth and taken to her refuge. Having no top to its
            head, she tied on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these deficiencies by
            folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid. If anyone had known the care
            lavished on that dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they laughed. She brought it
            bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it out to breathe the air, hidden under her coat, she sang it
            lullabies and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly, &ldquo;I hope
            you&rsquo;ll have a good night, my poor dear.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an angel but a very human little girl, she often
            &ldquo;wept a little weep,&rdquo; as Jo said, because she couldn&rsquo;t take music lessons and have a fine
            piano. She loved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practiced away so patiently at the jingling
            old instrument, that it did seem as if someone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did,
            however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn&rsquo;t keep in tune, when she
            was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work, never was too tired to play for Marmee and the
            girls, and day after day said hopefully to herself, &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ll get my music some time, if
            I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners till needed, and living for others so
            cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the
            sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she would have answered at once, &ldquo;My
            nose.&rdquo; When she was a baby, Jo had accidentally dropped her into the coal hod,<u><sup>af</sup></u> and
            Amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big nor red, like poor
            &ldquo;Petrea&lsquo;s,&rdquo; it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world could not give it
            an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself, and it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply
            the want of a Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Little Raphael,&rdquo;<u><sup>ag</sup></u> as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for
            drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing fairies, or illustrating stories with
            queer specimens of art. Her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with
            animals, the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps on, and caricatures of the most ludicrous
            description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as well as
            she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment. She was a great favorite with
            her mates, being good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort. Her little airs and
            graces were much admired; so were her accomplishments, for beside her drawing, she could play twelve tunes,
            crochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words. She had a plaintive way
            of saying, &ldquo;When Papa was rich we did so-and-so,&rdquo; which was very touching, and her long words
            were considered &ldquo;perfectly elegant&rdquo; by the girls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her, and her small vanities and selfishnesses were
            growing nicely. One thing, however, rather quenched the vanities: she had to wear her cousin&rsquo;s
            clothes. Now Florence&rsquo;s mamma hadn&rsquo;t a particle of taste, and Amy suffered deeply at having to
            wear a red instead of a blue bonnet, unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was
            good, well made, and little worn, but Amy&rsquo;s artistic eyes were much afflicted, especially this winter,
            when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My only comfort,&rdquo; she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, &ldquo;is that Mother doesn&rsquo;t
            take tucks in my dresses whenever I&rsquo;m naughty, as Maria Parks&rsquo; mother does. My dear, it&rsquo;s
            really dreadful, for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can&rsquo;t come to
            school. When I think of this deggerredation, I feel that I can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with
            yellow sky-rockets on it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg was Amy&rsquo;s confidante and monitor, and by some strange attraction of opposites Jo was gentle
            Beth&rsquo;s. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts; and over her big, harum-scarum sister Beth
            unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family. The two older girls were a great deal to
            one another, but each took one of the younger into her keeping and watched over her in her own
            way&mdash;&ldquo;playing mother&rdquo; they called it&mdash;and put their sisters in the places of discarded
            dolls with the maternal instinct of little women.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Has anybody got anything to tell? It&rsquo;s been such a dismal day I&rsquo;m really dying for some
            amusement,&rdquo; said Meg, as they sat sewing together that evening.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it, I&rsquo;ll tell you about it,&rdquo;
            began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. &ldquo;I was reading that</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice
            book, and read like fury till she wakes up. I actually made myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, I
            gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at
            once.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I wish I could, and be done with it,&rsquo; said I, trying not to be saucy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and think them over while she just
            &lsquo;lost&rsquo; herself for a moment. She never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to
            bob like a top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the Vicar of Wakefield <u><sup>ah</sup></u>out of my pocket, and read
            away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt. I&rsquo;d just got to where they all tumbled into the water when
            I forgot and laughed out loud. Aunt woke up and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me to read a
            bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and
            she liked it, though she only said&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what it&rsquo;s all about. Go back and begin it, child.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could. Once I was wicked enough to stop
            in a thrilling place, and say meekly, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it tires you, ma&rsquo;am; shan&rsquo;t I stop
            now?&lsquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me a sharp look through her
            specs, and said, in her short way, &lsquo;Finish the chapter, and don&rsquo;t be impertinent, miss.&rsquo;
            &rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Did she own she liked it?&rdquo; asked Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, bless you, no! But she let old Belsham rest, and when I ran back after my gloves this afternoon,
            there she was, so hard at the Vicar that she didn&rsquo;t hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall
            because of the good time coming. What a pleasant life she might have if she only chose! I don&rsquo;t envy
            her much, in spite of her money, for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones, I
            think,&rdquo; added Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve got something to tell. It isn&rsquo;t funny,
            like Jo&rsquo;s story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came home. At the Kings&rsquo; today I found
            everybody in a flurry, and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful, and
            Papa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned
            away their faces when they passed me, so I shouldn&rsquo;t see how red their eyes were. I didn&rsquo;t ask
            any questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and was rather glad I hadn&rsquo;t any wild brothers
            to do wicked things and disgrace the family.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than anything bad boys can do,&rdquo; said
            Amy, shaking her head, as if her experience of life had been a deep one. &rdquo;Susie Perkins came to school
            today with a lovely red carnelian ring. I wanted it dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might.
            Well, she drew a picture of Mr. Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, &lsquo;Young ladies,
            my eye is upon you!&rsquo; coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing. We were laughing over it when all of
            a sudden his eye was on us, and he ordered Susie to bring up her slate. She was parrylized with fright, but
            she went, and oh, what do you think he did? He took her by the ear&mdash;the ear! just fancy how
            horrid!&mdash;and led her to the recitation platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding that
            slate so everyone could see.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the girls laugh at the picture?&rdquo; asked Jo, who relished the scrape.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Laugh? Not one! They sat as still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I know she did. I didn&rsquo;t envy
            her then, for I felt that millions of carnelian rings wouldn&rsquo;t have made me happy after that. I never,
            never should have got over such a agonizing mortification.&rdquo; And Amy went on with her work, in the
            proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I saw something that I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at dinner, but I forgot,&rdquo; said
            Beth, putting Jo&rsquo;s topsy-turvy basket in order as she talked. &ldquo;When I went to get some oysters
            for Hannah, Mr. Laurence was in the fishshop; but he didn&rsquo;t see me, for I kept behind a barrel, and he
            was busy with Mr. Cutter the fishman. A poor woman came in with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he
            would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn&rsquo;t any dinner for her children, and
            had been disappointed of a day&rsquo;s work. Mr. Cutter was in a hurry, and said &lsquo;No,&rsquo; rather
            crossly; so she was going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the
            crooked end of his cane and held it out to her. She was so glad and surprised she took it right in her arms,
            and thanked him over and over. He told her to &lsquo;go along and cook it,&rsquo; and she hurried off, so
            happy! Wasn&rsquo;t it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping
            Mr. Laurence&rsquo;s bed in heaven would be &lsquo;aisy.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When they had laughed at Beth&rsquo;s story, they asked their mother for one, and, after a moment&rsquo;s
            thought, she said soberly, &ldquo;As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very
            anxious about Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should be, if anything happened to him. It was
            not a wise thing to do, but I kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes. He
            sat down near me, and I began to talk to him, for he looked poor and tired and anxious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Have you sons in the army?&rsquo; I asked, for the note he brought was not to me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and I&rsquo;m going to
            the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital,&lsquo; he answered quietly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;You have done a great deal for your country, sir,&rsquo; I said, feeling respect now, instead
            of pity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Not a mite more than I ought, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;d go myself, if I was any use; as I
            ain&lsquo;t, I give my boys, and give &rsquo;em free.&lsquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give his all, that I was ashamed of
            myself. I&rsquo;d given one man and thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging them. I had all
            my girls to comfort me at home, and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say good-by to him, perhaps! I
            felt so rich, so happy, thinking of my blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and
            thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tell another story, Mother&mdash;one with a moral to it, like this. I like to think about them
            afterward, if they are real and not too preachy,&rdquo; said Jo, after a minute&rsquo;s silence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to this little audience for many years, and
            knew how to please them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and drink and wear, a good many
            comforts and pleasures, kind friends and parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not
            contented.&rdquo; (Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew diligently.)
            &ldquo;These girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them
            very well, and were constantly saying, &lsquo;If we only had this,&rsquo; or &lsquo;If we could only do
            that,&rsquo; quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many pleasant things they actually could
            do. So they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy, and she said, &lsquo;When you
            feel discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.&rsquo; &rdquo; (Here Jo looked up quickly, as
            if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing that the story was not done yet.)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were surprised to see how well off they
            were. One discovered that money couldn&rsquo;t keep shame and sorrow out of rich people&rsquo;s houses;
            another that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her youth, health, and good spirits,
            than a certain fretful, feeble old lady who couldn&rsquo;t enjoy her comforts; a third that, disagreeable as
            it was to help get dinner, it was harder still to have to go begging for it; and the fourth, that even
            carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior. So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the
            blessings</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken away entirely, instead of increased;
            and I believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman&rsquo;s advice.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us, and give us a sermon
            instead of a romance!&rdquo; cried Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I like that kind of sermon. It&rsquo;s the sort Father used to tell us,&rdquo; said Beth thoughtfully,
            putting the needles straight on Jo&rsquo;s cushion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more careful than ever now, for
            I&rsquo;ve had warning from Susie&rsquo;s downfall,&rdquo; said Amy morally.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We needed that lesson, and we won&rsquo;t forget it. If we do, you just say to us, as old Chloe did in
            Uncle Tom, &lsquo;Tink ob yer marcies, chillen! tink ob yer marcies!&rsquo; &rdquo;<u><sup>ai</sup></u>
            added Jo, who could not, for the life of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though
            she took it to heart as much as any of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Being Neighborly</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What in the world are you going to do now, Jo?&rdquo; asked Meg one snowy afternoon, as her sister came
            tramping through the hall, in rubber boots, old sack,<u><sup>aj</sup></u> and hood, with a broom in one hand
            and a shovel in the other.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Going out for exercise,&rdquo; answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough! It&rsquo;s cold and dull out, and I
            advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire, as I do,&rdquo; said Meg with a shiver.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Never take advice! Can&rsquo;t keep still all day, and not being a pussy-cat, I don&rsquo;t like to
            doze by the fire. I like adventures, and I&rsquo;m going to find some.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg went back to toast her feet and read Ivanhoe,<u><sup>ak</sup></u> and Jo began to dig paths with great
            energy. The snow was light, and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk
            in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, the garden separated the Marches&rsquo;
            house from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the city, which was still countrylike, with
            groves and lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one side was an
            old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and
            the flowers which then surrounded it. On the other side was a stately stone mansion, plainly betokening
            every sort of comfort and luxury, from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the
            glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains. Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of
            house, for no children frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people
            went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To Jo&rsquo;s lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace, full of splendors and delights
            which no one enjoyed. She had long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the &ldquo;Laurence
            boy,&rdquo; who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to begin. Since the party, she
            had been more eager than ever, and had planned many ways of making friends with him; but he had not been
            seen lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window,
            looking wistfully down into their garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That boy is suffering for society and fun,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;His grandpa does not
            know what&rsquo;s good for him, and keeps him shut up all alone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play
            with, or somebody young and lively. I&rsquo;ve a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances.
            The plan of &ldquo;going over&rdquo; was not forgotten; and when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to
            try what could be done. She saw Mr. Laurence drive off, and then sal-lied out to dig her way down to the
            hedge, where she paused and took a survey. All quiet&mdash;curtains down at the lower windows, servants out
            of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; thought Jo, &ldquo;poor boy! All alone and sick this dismal day. It&rsquo;s a
            shame! I&rsquo;ll toss up a snowball and make him look out, and then say a kind word to him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a face which lost its listless look in a
            minute, as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and flourished her
            broom as she called out&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How do you do? Are you sick?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Better, thank you. I&rsquo;ve had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. What do you amuse yourself with?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nothing. It&rsquo;s as dull as tombs up here.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you read?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not much. They won&rsquo;t let me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t somebody read to you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don&rsquo;t interest him, and I hate to ask Brooke all the
            time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have someone come and see you, then.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anyone I&rsquo;d like to see. Boys make such a row, and my head is weak.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some nice girl who&rsquo;d read and amuse you? Girls are quiet and like to play
            nurse.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know any.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You know us,&rdquo; began Jo, then laughed, and stopped.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So I do! Will you come, please?&rdquo; cried Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quiet and nice, but I&rsquo;ll come, if Mother will let me. I&rsquo;ll go ask her. Shut
            that window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, wondering what they would all say to her.
            Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready; for, as
            Mrs. March said, he was &ldquo;a little gentleman,&rdquo; and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his
            curly pate, putting on a fresh collar, and trying to tidy up the room, which, in spite of half a dozen
            servants, was anything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring, then a decided voice, asking for
            &ldquo;Mr. Laurie,&rdquo; and a surprised-looking servant came running up to announce a young lady.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;All right, show her up, it&rsquo;s Miss Jo,&rdquo; said Laurie, going to the door of his little parlor
            to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and kind and quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and
            Beth&rsquo;s three kittens in the other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here I am, bag and baggage,&rdquo; she said briskly. &ldquo;Mother sent her love, and was glad if I
            could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to bring some of her blancmange,<u><sup>al</sup></u> she makes it
            very nicely; and Beth thought her cats would be comforting. I knew you&rsquo;d laugh at them, but I
            couldn&rsquo;t refuse, she was so anxious to do something.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It so happened that Beth&rsquo;s funny loan was just the thing, for in laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot
            his bashfulness, and grew sociable at once.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That looks too pretty to eat,&rdquo; he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo uncovered the dish, and
            showed the blancmange, surrounded by a garland of green</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy&rsquo;s pet geranium.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it. Tell the girl to put it away
            for your tea: it&rsquo;s so simple, you can eat it, and, being soft, it will slip down without hurting your
            sore throat. What a cozy room this is!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It might be if it was kept nice; but the maids are lazy, and I don&rsquo;t know how to make them mind.
            It worries me, though.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth brushed, so&mdash;and the
            things made straight on the mantelpiece, so&mdash;and the books put here, and the bottles there, and your
            sofa turned from the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now, then, you&rsquo;re fixed.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And so he was; for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different
            air to the room. Laurie watched her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat
            down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How kind you are! Yes, that&rsquo;s what it wanted. Now please take the big chair and let me do
            something to amuse my company.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud?&rdquo; and Jo
            looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you! I&rsquo;ve read all those, and if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d rather talk,&rdquo;
            answered Laurie. &ldquo;Not a bit. I&rsquo;ll talk all day if you&rsquo;ll only set me going. Beth says I
            never know when to stop.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home a good deal and sometimes goes out with a little
            basket?&rdquo; asked Laurie with interest. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s Beth. She&rsquo;s my girl, and a regular
            good one she is, too.&rdquo; &ldquo;The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I
            believe?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How did you find that out?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, &ldquo;Why, you see, I often hear you calling to one another, and
            when I&rsquo;m alone up here, I can&rsquo;t help looking over at your house, you always seem to be having
            such good times. I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at
            the window where the flowers are; and when the lamps are lighted, it&rsquo;s like looking at a picture to
            see the fire, and you all round the table with your mother; her face is right opposite, and it looks so
            sweet behind the flowers, I can&rsquo;t help watching it. I haven&rsquo;t got any mother, you know.&rdquo;
            And Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo&rsquo;s warm heart. She had been so simply taught
            that there was no nonsense in her head, and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie
            was sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home, love and happiness, she gladly tried to share it
            with him. Her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as much as you like. I just
            wish, though, instead of peeping, you&rsquo;d come over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she&rsquo;d do
            you heaps of good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would dance; Meg and I would make
            you laugh over our funny stage properties, and we&rsquo;d have jolly times. Wouldn&rsquo;t your grandpa let
            you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think he would, if your mother asked him. He&rsquo;s very kind, though he does not look so; and he
            lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he&rsquo;s afraid I might be a bother to strangers,&rdquo; began
            Laurie, brightening more and more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be a bother. We want
            to know you, and I&rsquo;ve been trying to do it this ever so long. We haven&rsquo;t been here a great
            while, you know, but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You see Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn&rsquo;t mind much what happens outside. Mr. Brooke,
            my tutor, doesn&rsquo;t stay here, you know, and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home
            and get on as I can.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad. You ought to make an effort to go visiting everywhere you are asked; then
            you&rsquo;ll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places to go to. Never mind being bashful; it won&rsquo;t
            last long if you keep going.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie turned red again, but wasn&rsquo;t offended at being accused of bashfulness, for there was so much
            good will in Jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you like your school?&rdquo; asked the boy, changing the subject, after a little pause, during
            which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about her, well pleased.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to school; I&rsquo;m a businessman-girl, I mean. I go to wait on my great-aunt, and a
            dear, cross old soul she is, too,&rdquo; answered Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering just in time that it wasn&rsquo;t manners to
            make too many inquiries into people&rsquo;s affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable. Jo liked
            his good breeding, and didn&rsquo;t mind having a laugh at Aunt March, so she gave him a lively description
            of the fidgety old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where she reveled.
            Laurie enjoyed that immensely; and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo Aunt
            March, and, in the middle of a fine speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy
            lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what was the
            matter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh! That does me no end of good. Tell on, please,&rdquo; he said, taking his face out of the sofa
            cushion, red and shining with merriment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Much elated with her success, Jo did &ldquo;tell on,&rdquo; all about their plays and plans, their hopes and
            fears for Father, and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived. Then they
            got to talking about books, and to Jo&rsquo;s delight, she found that Laurie loved them as well as she did,
            and had read even more than herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandpa is out, so you needn&rsquo;t be
            afraid,&rdquo; said Laurie, getting up.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of anything,&rdquo; returned Jo, with a toss of the head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you are!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much admiration, though
            he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him
            in some of his moods.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way from room to room, letting Jo stop to
            examine whatever struck her fancy; and so at last they came to the library, where she clapped her hands and
            pranced, as she always did when especially delighted. It was lined with books, and there were pictures and
            statues, and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow
            chairs,<u><sup>am</sup></u> and queer tables, and bronzes, and, best of all, a great open fireplace with
            quaint tiles all round it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What richness!&rdquo; sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velvet chair and gazing about her with an
            air of intense satisfaction. &ldquo;Theodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,&rdquo;
            she added impressively.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A fellow can&rsquo;t live on books,&rdquo; said Laurie, shaking his head as he perched on a table
            opposite.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before he could say more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with alarm, &ldquo;Mercy me! It&rsquo;s
            your grandpa!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know,&rdquo; returned
            the boy, looking wicked.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don&rsquo;t know why I should be. Marmee said I might
            come, and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re any the worse for it,&rdquo; said Jo, composing herself, though
            she kept her eyes on the door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I&rsquo;m only afraid you are very
            tired talking to me; it was so pleasant, I couldn&rsquo;t bear to stop,&rdquo; said Laurie gratefully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The doctor to see you, sir,&rdquo; and the maid beckoned as she spoke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see him,&rdquo; said Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me. I&rsquo;m as happy as a cricket here,&rdquo; answered Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was standing before a fine portrait of the
            old gentleman when the door opened again, and, without turning, she said decidedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
            now that I shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of him, for he&rsquo;s got kind eyes, though his mouth is grim, and he
            looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own. He isn&rsquo;t as handsome as my grandfather, but I like
            him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&lsquo;am,&rdquo; said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to her great dismay, stood
            old Mr. Laurence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Poor Jo blushed till she couldn&rsquo;t blush any redder, and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as
            she thought what she had said. For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly,
            and the girls would laugh at her; so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could. A second
            look showed her that the living eyes, under the bushy gray eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones;
            and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than
            ever, as the old gentleman said abruptly, after the dreadful pause, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not afraid of me,
            hey?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not much, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t think me as handsome as your grandfather?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not quite, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got a tremendous will, have I?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I only said I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But you like me in spite of it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That answer pleased the old gentleman; he gave a short laugh, shook hands with her, and, putting his finger
            under her chin, turned up her face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod,
            &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your grandfather&rsquo;s spirit, if you haven&rsquo;t his face. He was a fine man,
            my dear; but, what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and I was proud to be his friend.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo; And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited her exactly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?&rdquo; was the next question, sharply put.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Only trying to be neighborly, sir.&rdquo; And Jo told how her visit came about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good perhaps. We are only girls, but
            we should be glad to help if we could, for we don&rsquo;t forget the splendid Christmas present you sent
            us,&rdquo; said jo eagerly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, tut! That was the boy&rsquo;s affair. How is the poor woman?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Doing nicely, sir.&rdquo; And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told all about the Hummels, in
            whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just her father&rsquo;s way of doing good. I shall come and see your mother some fine day. Tell her
            so. There&rsquo;s the tea bell, we have it early on the boy&rsquo;s account. Come down and go on being
            neighborly.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d like to have me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t ask you, if I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And Mr. Laurence offered her his arm with
            old-fashioned courtesy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What would Meg say to this?&rdquo; thought Jo, as she was marched away, while her eyes danced with fun
            as she imagined herself telling the story at home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?&rdquo; said the old gentleman, as Laurie came
            running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astonishing sight of Jo arm in arm with
            his redoubtable grandfather.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d come, sir,&rdquo; he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant little glance.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s evident, by the way you racket downstairs. Come to your tea, sir, and behave like a
            gentleman.&rdquo; And having pulled the boy&rsquo;s hair by way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while
            Laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an explosion of
            laughter from Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea, but he watched the young people, who
            soon chatted away like old friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him. There was color,
            light, and life in the boy&rsquo;s face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right, the lad is lonely. I&rsquo;ll see what these little girls can do for him,&rdquo;
            thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she
            seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the Laurences had been what Jo called &ldquo;prim and poky,&rdquo; she would not have got on at all, for
            such people always made her shy and awkward; but finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a
            good impression. When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had something more to show her, and
            took her away to the conservatory, which had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo,
            as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either side, the soft light, the damp
            sweet air, and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the finest
            flowers till his hands were full; then he tied them up, saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see,
            &ldquo;Please give these to your mother, and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room, but Jo&rsquo;s attention was
            entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which stood open.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you play?&rdquo; she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful expression.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he answered modestly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you first?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know how. Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses. Her respect
            and regard for the &ldquo;Laurence boy&rdquo; increased very much, for he played remarkably well and
            didn&rsquo;t put on any airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so, only praised him till
            he was</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>quite abashed, and his grandfather came to the rescue. &ldquo;That will do, that will do, young lady. Too
            many sugarplums are not good for him. His music isn&rsquo;t bad, but I hope he will do as well in more
            important things. Going? Well, I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, and I hope you&rsquo;ll come again. My
            respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor Jo.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him. When they got into the hall, Jo asked
            Laurie if she had said anything amiss. He shook his head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, it was me; he doesn&rsquo;t like to hear me play.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No need of that. I am not a young lady, and it&rsquo;s only a step. Take care of yourself, won&rsquo;t
            you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, but you will come again, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you promise to come and see us after you are well.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good night, Laurie!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good night, Jo, good night!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When all the afternoon&rsquo;s adventures had been told, the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body,
            for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March wanted
            to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory,
            Beth sighed for the grand piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother, why didn&rsquo;t Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?&rdquo; asked Jo, who was of an
            inquiring disposition.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie&rsquo;s father, married an Italian lady, a
            musician, which displeased the old man, who is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished,
            but he did not like her, and never saw his son after he married. They both died when Laurie was a little
            child, and then his grandfather took him home. I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong,
            and the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes naturally by his love of
            music, for he is like his mother, and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician. At
            any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he &lsquo;glowered,&rsquo; as Jo
            said.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dear me, how romantic!&rdquo; exclaimed Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How silly!&rdquo; said Jo. &ldquo;Let him be a musician if he wants to, and not plague his life out
            sending him to college, when he hates to go.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I suppose. Italians are always
            nice,&rdquo; said Meg, who was a little sentimental.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never spoke to him, hardly,&rdquo; cried Jo, who
            was not sentimental.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave. That was a nice little
            speech about the medicine Mother sent him.&rdquo; &ldquo;He meant the blancmange, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I never saw such a girl! You don&rsquo;t know a compliment when you get it,&rdquo; said Meg, with the
            air of a young lady who knew all about the -matter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think they are great nonsense, and I&rsquo;ll thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun.
            Laurie&rsquo;s a nice boy and I like him, and I won&rsquo;t have any sentimental stuff about compliments and
            such rubbish. We&rsquo;ll all be good to him because he hasn&rsquo;t got any mother, and he may come over
            and see us, mayn&rsquo;t he, Marmee?&rdquo; Meg will</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will remember that children should be
            children as long as they can.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call myself a child, and I&rsquo;m not in my teens
            yet,&rdquo; observed Amy. &ldquo;What do you say, Beth?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I was thinking about our &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo;&rsquo; answered Beth, who had not
            heard a word. &ldquo;How we got out of the Slough and through the Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and
            up the steep hill by trying; and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going to be
            our Palace Beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We have got to get by the lions<u><sup>an</sup></u> first,&rdquo; said Jo, as if she rather liked the
            prospect.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>6</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth Finds the Palace Beautiful</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time for all to get in, and Beth found it
            very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, said something
            funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid
            of him, except timid Beth. The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich, for this made
            them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. But, after a while, they found that he considered
            them the benefactors, and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March&rsquo;s motherly
            welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot
            their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new friendship flourished like grass in
            spring. Every one liked Laurie, and he privately informed his tutor that &ldquo;the Marches were regularly
            splendid girls.&rdquo; With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the solitary boy into their midst
            and made much of him, and he found something very charming in the innocent companionship of these
            simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he was quick to feel the influences they brought
            about him, and their busy, lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired of books,
            and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for
            Laurie was always playing truant and running over to the Marches&lsquo;.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,&rdquo; said the old gentleman.
            &ldquo;The good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society, amusement, and
            exercise. I suspect she is right, and that I&rsquo;ve been coddling the fellow as if I&rsquo;d been his
            grandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He can&rsquo;t get into mischief in that
            little nunnery over there, and Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What good times they had, to be sure! Such plays and tableaux, such sleigh rides and skating frolics, such
            pleasant evenings in the old parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. Meg could
            walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library
            voraciously, and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed beauty to
            her heart&rsquo;s content, and Laurie played &ldquo;lord of the manor&rdquo; in the most delightful style.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up courage to go to the &ldquo;Mansion of
            Bliss,&rdquo; as Meg called it. She went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her
            infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; so loud, that he
            frightened her so much her &ldquo;feet chattered on the floor,&rdquo; she told her mother; and she ran away,
            declaring she would never go there any more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or enticements
            could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence&rsquo;s ear in some mysterious way, he set
            about mending matters. During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and
            talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes
            that Beth found it impossible to stay in her distant comer, but crept nearer and nearer, as if fascinated.
            At the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red
            with the excitement of this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly,
            Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie&rsquo;s lessons and teachers; and presently, as if the idea had just
            occurred to him, he said to Mrs. March&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The boy neglects his music now, and I&rsquo;m glad of it, for he was getting too fond of it. But the
            piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn&rsquo;t some of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now
            and then, just to keep it in tune, you know, ma&lsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them, for this was an
            irresistible temptation, and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath
            away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They needn&rsquo;t see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time; for I&rsquo;m shut up in my study
            at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room
            after nine o&lsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that last arrangement left nothing to be
            desired. &ldquo;Please tell the young ladies what I say, and if they don&rsquo;t care to come, why, never
            mind.&rdquo; Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude,
            as she said, in her earnest yet timid way&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;O sir, they do care, very, very much!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Are you the musical girl?&rdquo; he asked, without any startling &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; as he looked down
            at her very kindly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Beth. I love it dearly, and I&rsquo;ll come, if you are quite sure nobody will hear
            me&mdash;and be disturbed,&rdquo; she added, fearing to be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she
            spoke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day; so come and drum away as much as you like, and I
            shall be obliged to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;How kind you are, sir!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore; but she was not frightened now, and gave the big
            hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. The
            old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone
            few people ever heard&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you, my dear! Good day, madam.&rdquo; And
            away he went, in a great hurry.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the glorious news to her family of invalids,
            as the girls were not at home. How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her because
            she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep. Next day, having seen both the old
            and young gentleman out of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the side door, and
            made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of
            course, some pretty, easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen
            and look about, Beth at last touched the great instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and
            everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was like the voice of a beloved
            friend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner; but she had no appetite, and could only sit and smile
            upon everyone in a general state of beatitude.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day, and the great drawing room was
            haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen. She never knew that Mr. Laurence often opened his
            study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked; she never saw Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the
            servants away; she never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the rack were
            put there for her especial benefit; and when he talked to her about music at home, she only thought how kind
            he was to tell things that helped her so much. So she enjoyed</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>herself heartily, and found, what isn&rsquo;t always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped.
            Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her; at any rate, she
            deserved both.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;m going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so kind to me, I must thank
            him, and I don&rsquo;t know any other way. Can I do it?&rdquo; asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful
            call of his.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking him. The girls will help you
            about them, and I will pay for the making up,&rdquo; replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in
            granting Beth&rsquo;s requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen, the materials bought, and the
            slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very
            appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with occasional lifts over hard parts. She was
            a nimble little needlewoman, and they were finished before anyone got tired of them. Then she wrote a very
            short, simple note, and, with Laurie&rsquo;s help, got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before
            the old gentleman was up.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. All that day passed and a part of the
            next before any acknowledgment arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crotchety friend.
            On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an errand and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her
            daily exercise. As she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads popping in and out
            of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her, several hands were waved, and several joyful voices
            screamed&mdash;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read it!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;O Beth, he&rsquo;s sent you&mdash;&rdquo; began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy, but she got
            no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a
            triumphal procession, all pointing and all saying at once, &ldquo;Look there! look there!&rdquo; Beth did
            look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a little cabinet piano, with a letter lying
            on the glossy lid, directed like a sign board to &ldquo;Miss Elizabeth March.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should tumble down, it was such an
            overwhelming thing altogether.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, all for you, my precious! Isn&rsquo;t it splendid of him? Don&rsquo;t you think he&rsquo;s the
            dearest old man in the world? Here&rsquo;s the key in the letter. We didn&rsquo;t open it, but we are dying
            to know what he says,&rdquo; cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You read it! I can&lsquo;t, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely!&rdquo; And Beth hid her face in
            Jo&rsquo;s apron, quite upset by her present.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she saw were&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;MISS MARCH:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dear Madam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How nice it sounds! I wish someone would write to me so!&rdquo; said Amy, who thought the
            old-fashioned address very elegant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had any that suited me so well as
            yours,&rsquo; &rdquo; continued Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Heartsease is my favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle giver. I like
            to pay my debts, so I know you will allow &rdquo;the old gentleman&rdquo; to send you something which once
            belonged to the little granddaughter he lost. With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Your grateful friend and humble servant, &ldquo; &lsquo;JAMES LAURENCE.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There, Beth, that&rsquo;s an honor to be proud of, I&rsquo;m sure! Laurie told me how fond Mr.
            Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept all her little things carefully. Just think,
            he&rsquo;s given you her piano. That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,&rdquo; said Jo, trying
            to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk, puckered up, with a gold rose in
            the middle, and the pretty rack and stool, all complete,&rdquo; added Meg, opening the instrument and
            displaying its beauties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Your humble servant, James Laurence.&rsquo; Only think of his writing that to you. I&rsquo;ll
            tell the girls. They&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s splendid,&rdquo; said Amy, much impressed by the note.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Try it, honey. Let&rsquo;s hear the sound of the baby pianny,&rdquo; said Hannah, who always took a
            share in the family joys and sorrows.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard. It had evidently been
            newly tuned and put in apple-pie order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm of it lay in the
            happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white
            keys and pressed the bright pedals.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go and thank him,&rdquo; said Jo, by way of a joke, for the idea of the
            child&rsquo;s really going never entered her head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I mean to. I guess I&rsquo;ll go now, before I get frightened thinking about it.&rdquo; And, to
            the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge,
            and in at the Laurences&rsquo; door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I wish I may die if it ain&rsquo;t the queerest thing I ever see! The pianny has turned her
            head! She&rsquo;d never have gone in her right mind,&rdquo; cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls
            were rendered quite speechless by the miracle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did afterward. If you will believe me, she
            went and knocked at the study door before she gave herself time to think, and when a gruff voice called out,
            &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who looked quite taken aback, and held out
            her hand, saying, with only a small quaver in her voice, &ldquo;I came to thank you, sir, for&mdash;&rdquo;
            But she didn&rsquo;t finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and, only remembering that
            he had lost the little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and kissed him.</p>
        <p>If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman wouldn&rsquo;t have been more astonished;
            but he liked it&mdash;oh, dear, yes, he liked it amazingly!&mdash;and was so touched and pleased by that
            confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished; and he just set her on his knee, and laid his
            wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he had got his own little granddaughter back again. Beth
            ceased to fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her
            life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude can conquer pride. When she went home, he walked with her to
            her own gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back again, looking very stately and
            erect, like a handsome, soldierly old gentleman, as he was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of expressing her satisfaction, Amy
            nearly fell out of the window in her surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with uplifted hands, &ldquo;Well, I do
            believe the world is coming to an end!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>7</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy&rsquo;s Valley of Humiliation</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That boy is a perfect Cyclops, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Amy, one day, as Laurie clattered by on horseback,
            with a flourish of his whip as he passed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How dare you say so, when he&rsquo;s got both his eyes? And very handsome ones they are, too,&rdquo;
            cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about her friend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything about his eyes, and I don&rsquo;t see why you need fire up when I admire
            his riding.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, my goodness! That little goose means a centaur, and she called him a Cyclops,&rdquo; exclaimed Jo,
            with a burst of laughter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be so rude, it&rsquo;s only a &lsquo;lapse of lingy,&rsquo;<u><sup>ao</sup></u> as
            Mr. Davis says,&rdquo; retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. &ldquo;I just wish I had a little of the
            money Laurie spends on that horse,&rdquo; she added, as if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy&rsquo;s second blunder.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I need it so much. I&rsquo;m dreadfully in debt, and it won&rsquo;t be my turn to have the rag money
            for a month.&rdquo; &ldquo;In debt, Amy? What do you mean?&rdquo; And Meg looked sober.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can&rsquo;t pay them, you know, till I have money,
            for Marmee forbade my having anything charged at the shop.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be pricking bits of rubber to make
            balls.&rdquo; And Meg tried to keep her countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to be thought mean, you must do
            it, too. It&rsquo;s nothing but limes now, for everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime, and
            trading them off for pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, or something else, at recess. If one girl likes
            another, she gives her a lime; if she&rsquo;s mad with her, she eats one before her face, and doesn&rsquo;t
            offer even a suck. They treat by turns, and I&rsquo;ve had ever so many but haven&rsquo;t returned them, and
            I ought, for they are debts of honor, you know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How much will pay them off, and restore your credit?&rdquo; asked Meg, taking out her purse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a treat for you. Don&rsquo;t you like
            limes?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not much; you may have my share. Here&rsquo;s the money. Make it last as long as you can, for it
            isn&rsquo;t very plenty, you know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket money! I&rsquo;ll have a grand feast, for I
            haven&rsquo;t tasted a lime this week. I felt delicate about taking any, as I couldn&rsquo;t return them,
            and I&rsquo;m actually suffering for one.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Next day Amy was rather late at school; but could not resist the temptation of displaying, with pardonable
            pride, a moist brown-paper parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk. During the
            next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and
            was going to treat circulated through her &ldquo;set,&rdquo; and the attentions of her friends became quite
            overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her to her next party on the spot; Mary Kingsley insisted on lending her
            her watch till recess; and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon her limeless
            state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not
            forgotten Miss Snow&rsquo;s cutting remarks about &ldquo;some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell
            other people&rsquo;s limes, and stuck-up people who were not too proud to ask for them&rdquo;; and she
            instantly crushed &ldquo;that Snow girl&lsquo;s&rdquo; hopes by the withering telegram, &ldquo;You
            needn&rsquo;t be so polite all of a sudden, for you won&rsquo;t get any.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning, and Amy&rsquo;s beautifully drawn maps
            received praise, which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume
            the airs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! Pride goes before a fall, and the revengeful Snow
            turned the tables with disastrous success. No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and
            bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the
            teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her desk.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly vowed to publicly
            ferrule<u><sup>ap</sup></u> the first person who was found breaking the law. This much-enduring man had
            succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels
            and newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and
            caricatures, and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys are
            trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous
            gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber.<u><sup>aq</sup></u> Mr.
            Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher,
            and manners, morals, feelings, and examples were not considered of any particular importance. It was a most
            unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too
            strong that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his neuralgia, and his pupils had not
            done him the credit which he felt he deserved: therefore, to use the expressive, if not elegant, language of
            a schoolgirl, &ldquo;he was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear.&rdquo; The word
            &ldquo;limes&rdquo; was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with an
            energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Young ladies, attention, if you please!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black, gray, and brown eyes were obediently
            fixed upon his awful countenance. &ldquo;Miss March, come to the desk.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed her, for the limes weighed upon her
            conscience.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bring with you the limes you have in your desk&rdquo; was the unexpected command which arrested her
            before she got out of her seat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take all,&rdquo; whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great presence of mind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before Mr. Davis, feeling that any man possessing a
            human heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis particularly
            detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust added to his wrath.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; stammered Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bring the rest immediately.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are sure there are no more?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I never lie, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as the last hope fled, and the treat was
            ravished from their longing lips. Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times, and
            as each doomed couple&mdash;looking oh! so plump and juicy&mdash;fell from her reluctant hands, a shout from
            the street completed the anguish of the girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by
            the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes.<u><sup>3</sup></u> This&mdash;this was too much; all
            flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable Davis, and one passionate limelover burst into
            tears.</p>
        <p>As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; and said, in his most
            impressive manner&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. I am sorry this has happened, but I never
            allow my rules to be infringed, and I never break my word. Miss March, hold out your hand.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better
            than the words she could not utter. She was rather a favorite with &ldquo;old Davis,&rdquo; as, of course,
            he was called, and it&rsquo;s my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one
            irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss. That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible
            gentleman, and sealed the culprit&rsquo;s fate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your hand, Miss March!&rdquo; was the only answer her mute appeal received; and, too proud to cry or
            beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her head defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows
            on her little palm. They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no difference to her. For the first time
            in her life she had been struck, and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her down.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You will now stand on the platform till recess,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, resolved to do the thing
            thoroughly, since he had begun.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her seat, and see the pitying faces of her friends,
            or the satisfied ones of her few enemies; but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon her,
            seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood, and break her
            heart with crying. A bitter sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it, and, taking
            the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and
            stood there, , so motionless and white that the girls found it very hard to study with that pathetic figure
            before them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which
            she never forgot. To others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a hard
            experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone, and a blow of that
            sort had never touched her before. The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the
            sting of the thought, &ldquo;I shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at last, and the word &ldquo;Recess!&rdquo; had
            never seemed so welcome to her before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You can go, Miss March,&rdquo; said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt, uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she went, without a word to anyone, straight
            into the anteroom, snatched her things, and left the place &ldquo;forever,&rdquo; as she passionately
            declared to herself. She was in a sad state when she got home, and when the older girls arrived, some time
            later, an indignation meeting was held at once. Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed, and
            comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine
            and tears, Beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo wrathfully
            proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and Hannah shook her fist at the &ldquo;villain&rdquo;
            and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No notice was taken of Amy&rsquo;s flight, except by her mates; but the sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered
            that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in the afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, Jo
            appeared, wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk, and delivered a letter from her mother,
            then collected Amy&rsquo;s property, and departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door
            mat, as if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a little every day with Beth,&rdquo;
            said Mrs. March that evening. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I
            dislike Mr. Davis&rsquo;s manner of teaching and don&rsquo;t think the girls you associate with are doing
            you any good, so I shall ask your father&rsquo;s advice before I send you anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old school. It&rsquo;s perfectly
            maddening to think of those lovely limes,&rdquo; sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved some punishment for
            disobedience&rdquo; was the severe reply, which rather disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but
            sympathy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?&rdquo; cried Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,&rdquo; replied her mother, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
            not sure that it won&rsquo;t do you more good than a milder method. You are getting to be rather conceited,
            my dear, and it is quite time you set about correcting it. You have a good many little gifts and virtues,
            but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger that
            real talent or goodness will be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it
            well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power is modesty.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So it is!&rdquo; cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo. &ldquo;I knew a girl once,
            who had a really remarkable talent for music, and she didn&rsquo;t know it, never guessed what sweet little
            things she composed when she was alone, and wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it if anyone had told her.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d known that nice girl; maybe she would have helped me, I&rsquo;m so stupid,&rdquo;
            said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else could,&rdquo; answered Laurie, looking at
            her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her
            face in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth, who could not be prevailed upon to play for
            them after her compliment. So Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly lively
            humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character. When he was gone, Amy, who had
            been pensive all the evening, said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea, &ldquo;Is Laurie an accomplished
            boy?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent; he will make a fine man, if not spoiled
            by petting,&rdquo; replied her mother.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And he isn&rsquo;t conceited, is he?&rdquo; asked Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not in the least. That is why he is so charming and we all like him so much.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I see. It&rsquo;s nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but not to show off or get perked
            up,&rdquo;<u><sup>ar</sup></u> said Amy thoughtfully.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;These things are always seen and felt in a person&rsquo;s manner and conversation, if modestly used,
            but it is not necessary to display them,&rdquo; said Mrs.</p>
        <p>March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Any more than it&rsquo;s proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once, that folks may
            know you&rsquo;ve got them,&rdquo; added Jo; and the lecture</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>ended in a laugh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>8</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo Meets Apollyon</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Girls, where are you going?&rdquo; asked Amy, coming into their room one Saturday afternoon, and finding them
            getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Never mind. Little girls shouldn&rsquo;t ask questions,&rdquo; returned Jo sharply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young, it is to be told that; and to be
            bidden to &ldquo;run away, dear&rdquo; is still more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and
            determined to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who never refused her anything
            very long, she said coaxingly, &ldquo;Do tell me! I should think you might let me go, too, for Beth is
            fussing over her piano, and I haven&rsquo;t got anything to do, and am so lonely.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&lsquo;t, dear, because you aren&rsquo;t invited,&rdquo; began Meg, but Jo broke in impatiently,
            &ldquo;Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all. You can&rsquo;t go, Amy, so don&rsquo;t be a baby, and
            whine about it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are; you were whispering and laughing together on the
            sofa last night, and you stopped when I came in. Aren&rsquo;t you going with him?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, we are; now do be still, and stop bothering.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her pocket.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know! I know! You&rsquo;re going to the theater to see the Seven Castles! &rdquo; she cried, adding
            resolutely, &ldquo;and I shall go, for Mother said I might see it; and I&rsquo;ve got my rag
            money,<u><sup>as</sup></u> and it was mean not to tell me in time.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,&rdquo; said Meg soothingly. &ldquo;Mother
            doesn&rsquo;t wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this
            fairy piece. Next week you can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please let me. I&rsquo;ve been sick
            with this cold so long, and shut up, I&rsquo;m dying for some fun. Do, Meg! I&rsquo;ll be ever so
            good,&rdquo; pleaded Amy, looking as pathetic as she could.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Suppose we take her. I don&rsquo;t believe Mother would mind, if we bundle her up well,&rdquo; began
            Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If she goes I shan&rsquo;t; and if I don&lsquo;t, Laurie won&rsquo;t like it; and it will be very
            rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy. I should think she&rsquo;d hate to poke herself where
            she isn&rsquo;t wanted,&rdquo; said Jo crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child
            when she wanted to enjoy herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying, in her most aggravating way, &ldquo;I
            shall go; Meg says I may; and if I pay for myself, Laurie hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn&rsquo;t sit alone; so Laurie
            will give you his place, and that will spoil our pleasure; or he&rsquo;ll get another seat for you, and that
            isn&rsquo;t proper when you weren&rsquo;t asked. You shan&rsquo;t stir a step, so you may just stay where
            you are,&rdquo; scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her finger in her hurry.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg to reason with her, when Laurie called from
            below, and the two girls hurried down, leaving their sister wailing; for now and then she forgot her
            grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child. Just as the party was setting out, Amy called over the
            banisters in a threatening tone, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you
            ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo; returned Jo, slamming the door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had a charming time, for The Seven Castles of the Diamond Lake<u><sup>at</sup></u> was as brilliant and
            wonderful as heart could wish. But, in spite of the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and gorgeous princes
            and princesses, Jo&rsquo;s pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it: the fairy queen&rsquo;s yellow curls
            reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make
            her &ldquo;sorry for it.&rdquo; She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives, for
            both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused. Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy,
            and semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed afterward. Although the oldest, Jo
            had the least self-control, and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting
            her into trouble, her anger never lasted long, and having humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented
            and tried to do better. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a fury because she was
            such an angel afterward. Poor Jo tried desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame
            up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed an injured air as they came in, never
            lifted her eyes from her book, or asked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have conquered
            resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play. On going up
            to put away her best hat, Jo&rsquo;s first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had
            soothed her feelings by turning Jo&rsquo;s top drawer upside down on the floor. Everything was in its place,
            however, and after a hasty glance into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had
            forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were
            sitting together, late in the afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and demanding
            breathlessly, &ldquo;Has anyone taken my book?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg and Beth said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; at once, and looked surprised. Amy poked the fire and said nothing. Jo
            saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Amy, you&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You know where it is, then!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fib!&rdquo; cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking fierce enough to
            frighten a much braver child than Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t got it, don&rsquo;t know where it is now, and don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You know something about it, and you&rsquo;d better tell at once, or I&rsquo;ll make you.&rdquo; And
            Jo gave her a slight shake.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Scold as much as you like, you&rsquo;ll never see your silly old book again,&rdquo; cried Amy, getting
            excited in her turn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I burned it up.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What! My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to finish before Father got home?
            Have you really burned it?&rdquo; said Jo, turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched
            Amy nervously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did! I told you I&rsquo;d make you pay for being so cross yesterday, and I have,
            so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy got no farther, for Jo&rsquo;s hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her
            head, crying, in a passion of grief and anger&mdash; &ldquo;You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it
            again, and I&rsquo;ll never forgive you as long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside herself; and, with a parting box on
            her sister&rsquo;s ear, she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight
            alone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard the story, soon brought Amy to a
            sense of the wrong she had done her sister. Jo&rsquo;s book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by
            her family as a literary sprout of great promise. It was only half a dozen little fairy tales, but Jo had
            worked over them patiently, putting her whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to
            print. She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the old manuscript, so that Amy&rsquo;s
            bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years. It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a
            dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her. Beth mourned as for a departed
            kitten, and Meg refused to defend her pet; Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one
            would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all Amy&rsquo;s courage
            to say meekly&mdash; &ldquo;Please forgive me, Jo, I&rsquo;m very, very sorry.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I never shall forgive you&rdquo; was Jo&rsquo;s stern answer, and from that moment she ignored Amy
            entirely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No one spoke of the great trouble&mdash;not even Mrs. March&mdash;for all had learned by experience that when
            Jo was in that mood words were wasted, and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her
            own generous nature, softened Jo&rsquo;s resentment and healed the breach. It was not a happy evening, for,
            though they sewed as usual, while their mother read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or
            Edgeworth,<u><sup>au</sup></u> something was wanting, and the sweet home peace was disturbed. They felt this
            most when singing time came, for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone, and Amy broke down, so Meg
            and Mother sang alone. But, in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not
            seem to chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, &ldquo;My dear, don&rsquo;t let the sun go
            down upon your anger; forgive each other, help each other, and begin again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her grief and anger all away; but tears were
            an unmanly weakness, and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldn&rsquo;t quite forgive yet. So she
            winked hard, shook her head, and said gruffly because Amy was listening, &ldquo;It was an abominable thing,
            and she doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed, and began to wish she had not humbled
            herself, to feel more injured than ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was
            particularly exasperating. Jo still looked like a thundercloud, and nothing went well all day. It was bitter
            cold in the morning; she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack of fidgets,
            Meg was pensive, Beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about
            people who were always talking about being good and yet wouldn&rsquo;t try when other people set them a
            virtuous example.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Everybody is so hateful, I&rsquo;ll ask Laurie to go skating. He is always kind and jolly, and will
            put me to rights, I know,&rdquo; said Jo to herself, and off she went.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient exclamation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There! she promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice we shall have. But it&rsquo;s no
            use to ask such a crosspatch to take me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. You were very naughty, and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little
            book; but I think she might do it now, and I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute,&rdquo; said
            Meg. &ldquo;Go after them; don&rsquo;t say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie, then take a
            quiet minute and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll be friends again with
            all her heart.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a flurry to get ready, she ran
            after the friends, who were just disappearing over the hill.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached them. Jo saw her coming, and turned her
            back. Laurie did not see, for he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm spell
            had preceded the cold snap.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on to the first bend, and see if it&rsquo;s all right before we begin to race,&rdquo;
            Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing her fingers as she tried to put her skates
            on, but Jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of
            satisfaction in her sister&rsquo;s troubles. She had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took
            possession of her, as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once. As Laurie turned the
            bend, he shouted back&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Keep near the shore; it isn&rsquo;t safe in the middle.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo heard, but Amy was just struggling to her feet and did not catch a word. Jo glanced over her shoulder, and
            the little demon she was harboring said in her ear&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and Amy, far behind, striking out toward the
            smoother ice in the middle of the river. For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling at her heart;
            then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her round, just in time to see Amy throw up her
            hands and go down, with the sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made Jo&rsquo;s
            heart stand still with fear. She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone; she tried to rush forward,
            but her feet seemed to have no strength in them; and, for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring
            with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the black water. Something rushed swiftly by her,
            and Laurie&rsquo;s voice cried out&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bring a rail. Quick, quick!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How she did it, she never knew; but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed, blindly obeying
            Laurie, who was quite self-possessed, and, lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey<u><sup>av</sup></u>
            till Jo dragged a rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more frightened than hurt.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can; pile our things on her, while I get off these
            confounded skates,&rdquo; cried Laurie, wrapping his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps, which
            never seemed so intricate before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled
            in blankets before a hot fire. During the bustle</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about, looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and
            her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When Amy was comfortably asleep, the
            house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Are you sure she is safe?&rdquo; whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the golden head, which might
            have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Quite safe, dear. She is not hurt, and won&rsquo;t even take cold, I think, you were so sensible in
            covering and getting her home quickly,&rdquo; replied her mother cheerfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Laurie did it all. I only let her go. Mother, if she should die, it would be my fault.&rdquo; And Jo
            dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly
            condemning her hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which
            might have come upon her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my dreadful temper! I try to cure it; I think I have, and then it breaks out worse than
            ever. Oh, Mother, what shall I do? What shall I do?&rdquo; cried poor Jo, in despair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is impossible to conquer your
            fault,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly
            that Jo cried harder than ever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, you can&rsquo;t guess how bad it is! It seems as if I could do anything when
            I&rsquo;m in a passion; I get so savage, I could hurt anyone and enjoy it. I&rsquo;m afraid I shall do
            something dreadful some day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. Oh, Mother, help me, do help
            me!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I will, my child, I will. Don&rsquo;t cry so bitterly, but remember this day, and resolve with all
            your soul that you will never know another like it. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater
            than yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. You think your temper is the worst in the
            world, but mine used to be just like it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yours, Mother? Why, you are never angry!&rdquo; And for the moment Jo forgot remorse in surprise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded in controlling it. I am
            angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I have learned not to show it; and I still hope to learn not to
            feel it, though it may take me another forty years to do so.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to Jo than the wisest
            lecture, the sharpest reproof. She felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her; the
            knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it, made her own easier to bear and
            strengthened her resolution to cure it, though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a
            girl of fifteen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes, when
            Aunt March scolds or people worry you?&rdquo; asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever
            before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and when I feel that they mean
            to break out against my will, I just go away a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and
            wicked,&rdquo; answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed and fastened up Jo&rsquo;s
            disheveled hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How did you learn to keep still? That is what troubles me&mdash;for the sharp words fly out before I
            know what I&rsquo;m about, and the more I say the worse I get, till it&rsquo;s a pleasure to hurt
            people&rsquo;s feelings and say dreadful things. Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My good mother used to help me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;As you do us&mdash;&rdquo; interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years had to struggle on alone, for I
            was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter
            tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on. Then your father came, and I
            was so happy that I found it easy to be good. But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and
            we were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by nature, and it tried me very much to
            see my children wanting anything.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Poor Mother! What helped you then?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your father, Jo. He never loses patience&mdash;never doubts or complains&mdash;but always hopes, and
            works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him. He helped and comforted me,
            and showed me that I must try to practice all the virtues I would have my little girls possess, for I was
            their example. It was easier to try for your sakes than for my own; a startled or surprised look from one of
            you when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done; and the love, respect, and
            confidence of my children was the sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would
            have them copy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, if I&rsquo;m ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,&rdquo; cried Jo, much
            touched.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep watch over your &lsquo;bosom
            enemy,&rsquo; as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not spoil your life. You have had a warning; remember
            it, and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you greater sorrow and regret
            than you have known today.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I will try, Mother, I truly will. But you must help me, remind me, and keep me from flying out. I used
            to see Father sometimes put his finger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober face, and you
            always folded your lips tight or went away: was he reminding you then?&rdquo; asked Jo softly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes. I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me from many a sharp word by that
            little gesture and kind look.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo saw that her mother&rsquo;s eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke, and fearing that she had said
            too much, she whispered anxiously, &ldquo;Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it? I didn&rsquo;t mean
            to be rude, but it&rsquo;s so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so safe and happy here.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my
            girls confide in me and know how much I love them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d grieved you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, dear; but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him, how much I owe him, and how
            faithfully I should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn&rsquo;t cry when he went, and never complain now, or seem as
            if you needed any help,&rdquo; said Jo, wondering.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was gone. Why should I complain, when
            we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end? If I don&rsquo;t seem to
            need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than Father, to comfort and sustain me. My child, the
            troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive them
            all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly
            one. The more you love and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human
            power and wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken from you, but may become the
            source of lifelong peace, happiness, and strength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little
            cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>as you come to your mother.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo&rsquo;s only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer
            she had ever prayed left her heart without words; for in that sad yet happy hour, she had learned not only
            the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of self-denial and self-control; and, led by her
            mother&rsquo;s hand, she had drawn nearer to the Friend who welcomes every child with a love stronger than
            that of any father, tenderer than that of any mother.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and, as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault, Jo looked up with
            an expression on her face which it had never worn before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I let the sun go down on my anger; I wouldn&rsquo;t forgive her, and today, if it hadn&rsquo;t been
            for Laurie, it might have been too late! How could I be so wicked?&rdquo; said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned
            over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a smile that went straight to Jo&rsquo;s
            heart. Neither said a word, but they hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was
            forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg Goes to Vanity Fair</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just
            now,&rdquo; said Meg, one April day, as she stood packing the &ldquo;go abroady&rdquo; trunk in her room,
            surrounded by her sisters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A whole fortnight of fun will be regularly
            splendid,&rdquo; replied Jo, looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And such lovely weather, I&rsquo;m so glad of that,&rdquo; added Beth, tidily sorting neck and hair
            ribbons in her best box, lent for the great occasion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things,&rdquo; said Amy with her mouth
            full of pins, as she artistically replenished her sister&rsquo;s cushion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish you were all going, but as you can&lsquo;t, I shall keep my adventures to tell you when I come
            back. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the least I can do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping
            me get ready,&rdquo; said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit, which seemed nearly
            perfect in their eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?&rdquo; asked Amy, who had not been present at the
            opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs. March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her
            girls when the proper time came.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue sash. I wanted the violet silk,
            but there isn&rsquo;t time to make it over, so I must be contented with my old
            tarlatan.&rdquo;<u><sup>aw</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it off beautifully. I wish I
            hadn&rsquo;t smashed my coral bracelet, for you might have had it,&rdquo; said Jo, who loved to give and
            lend, but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure box, but Mother said real flowers were the
            prettiest ornament for a young girl, and Laurie promised to send me all I want,&rdquo; replied Meg.
            &ldquo;Now, let me see, there&rsquo;s my new gray walking suit&mdash;just curl up the feather in my hat,
            Beth&mdash;then my poplin for Sunday and the small party&mdash;it looks heavy for spring, doesn&rsquo;t it?
            The violet silk would be so nice; oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Never mind, you&rsquo;ve got the tarlatan for the big party, and you always look like an angel in
            white,&rdquo; said Amy, brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t low-necked, and it doesn&rsquo;t sweep enough, but it will have to do. My blue
            housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that I feel as if I&rsquo;d got a new one. My silk
            sacque isn&rsquo;t a bit the fashion, and my bonnet doesn&rsquo;t look like Sallie&rsquo;s; I didn&rsquo;t
            like to say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. I told Mother black with a white handle,
            but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle. It&rsquo;s strong and neat, so I ought not to
            complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie&rsquo;s silk one with a gold top,&rdquo; sighed
            Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Change it,&rdquo; advised Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be so silly, or hurt Marmee&rsquo;s feelings, when she took so much pains to get my
            things. It&rsquo;s a nonsensical notion of mine, and I&rsquo;m not going to give up to it. My silk stockings
            and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort. You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich and sort of
            elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for common.&rdquo; And Meg took a refreshing peep
            at her glove box.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps; would you put some on mine?&rdquo; she asked, as
            Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins, fresh from Hannah&rsquo;s hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&lsquo;t, for the smart caps won&rsquo;t match the plain gowns without any trimming on
            them. Poor folks shouldn&rsquo;t rig,&rdquo;<u><sup>ax</sup></u> said Jo decidedly.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps?&rdquo;
            said Meg impatiently.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You said the other day that you&rsquo;d be perfectly happy if you could only go to Annie
            Moffat&lsquo;s,&rdquo; observed Beth in her quiet way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So I did! Well, I am happy, and I won&rsquo;t fret, but it does seem as if the more one gets the more
            one wants, doesn&rsquo;t it? There, now, the trays are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I
            shall leave for Mother to pack,&rdquo; said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the half-filled trunk to
            the many-times-pressed-and-mended white tarlatan, which she called her &ldquo;ball dress&rdquo; with an
            important air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had
            consented to the visit rather reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented than she
            went. But she had begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take good care of her, and a little pleasure
            seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went to take
            her first taste of fashionable life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted, at first, by the splendor of the house
            and the elegance of its occupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life they led, and
            soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt, without understanding why, that they were not
            particularly cultivated or intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the
            ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine
            carriage, wear her best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited her exactly, and soon
            she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use
            French phrases, crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well as she could. The
            more she saw of Annie Moffat&rsquo;s pretty things, the more she envied her and sighed to be rich. Home now
            looked bare and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she was a very
            destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls were busily employed in &ldquo;having
            a good time.&rdquo; They shopped, walked, rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked
            at home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them. Her older sisters were
            very fine young ladies, and one was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought. Mr.
            Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took
            as great a fancy to Meg as her daughter had done. Everyone petted her, and &ldquo;Daisy,&rdquo; as they
            called her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the evening for the &ldquo;small party&rdquo; came, she found that the poplin wouldn&rsquo;t do at all,
            for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed; so out came the
            tarlatan, looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie&rsquo;s crisp new one. Meg saw the
            girls glance at it and then at one another, and her cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she
            was very proud. No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and Annie to tie her
            sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms; but in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her
            poverty, and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed, chattered, and
            flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of flowers. Before she could speak, Annie had
            the cover off, and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, but these are altogether
            ravishing,&rdquo; cried Annie, with a great sniff.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They are for Miss March, the man said. And here&rsquo;s a note,&rdquo; put in the maid, holding it to
            Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What fun! Who are they from? Didn&rsquo;t know you had a lover,&rdquo; cried the girls, fluttering
            about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie,&rdquo; said Meg simply, yet much gratified that
            he had not forgotten her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of
            talisman against envy, vanity, and false pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers
            cheered her up by their beauty.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself, and quickly made up the rest in
            dainty bouquets for the breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that Clara, the
            elder sister, told her she was &ldquo;the sweetest little thing she ever saw,&rdquo; and they looked quite
            charmed with her small attention. Somehow the kind act finished her despondency; and when all the rest went
            to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns
            against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that didn&rsquo;t strike her as so very shabby
            now.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her heart&rsquo;s content; everyone was very
            kind, and she had three compliments. Annie made her sing, and someone said she had a remarkably fine voice.
            Major Lincoln asked who &ldquo;the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes&rdquo; was, and Mr. Moffat
            insisted on dancing with her because she &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t dawdle, but had some spring in her,&rdquo; as
            he gracefully expressed it. So altogether she had a very nice time, till she overheard a bit of a
            conversation, which disturbed her extremely. She was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her
            partner to bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,&rdquo; replied another voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Sallie says they are very
            intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs. M. has made her plans, I dare say, and
            will play her cards well, early as it is. The girl evidently doesn&rsquo;t think of it yet,&rdquo; said Mrs.
            Moffat.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She told that fib about her mamma, as if she did know, and colored up when the flowers came quite
            prettily. Poor thing! She&rsquo;d be so nice if she was only got up in style. Do you think she&rsquo;d be
            offended if we offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?&rdquo; asked another voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s proud, but I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;d mind, for that dowdy tarlatan is all she has
            got. She may tear it tonight, and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see. I shall ask young Laurence, as a compliment to her, and we&rsquo;ll have fun about it
            afterward.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here Meg&rsquo;s partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated. She was proud, and
            her pride was useful just then, for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what she had
            just heard; for, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she could not help understanding the gossip of her
            friends. She tried to forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, &ldquo;Mrs. M. has made her
            plans,&rdquo; &ldquo;that fib about her mamma,&rdquo; and &ldquo;dowdy tarlatan,&rdquo; till she was ready
            to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. As that was impossible, she did her best to
            seem gay, and being rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making.
            She was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed, where she could think and wonder and
            fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those foolish, yet
            well-meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till
            now she had lived as happily as a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled by the silly
            speeches she had overheard; her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to
            her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others by herself; and the sensible resolution to be contented with the
            simple wardrobe which suited a poor man&rsquo;s daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who
            thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half resentful toward her friends, and half
            ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right. Everybody dawdled that
            morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work. Something
            in the manner of her friends struck Meg at once: they treated her with more respect, she thought, took quite
            a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. All this
            surprised and flattered her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her writing,
            and said, with a sentimental air&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Daisy, dear, I&rsquo;ve sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for Thursday. We should like
            to know him, and it&rsquo;s only a proper compliment to you.&rdquo; Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to
            tease the girls made her reply demurely, &ldquo;You are very kind, but I&rsquo;m afraid he won&rsquo;t
            come.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not, ch&eacute;rie?&rdquo; asked Miss Belle.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too old.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know!&rdquo; cried Miss Clara.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nearly seventy, I believe,&rdquo; answered Meg, counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You sly creature! Of course we meant the young man,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Belle, laughing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any, Laurie is only a little boy.&rdquo; And Meg laughed also at the queer look
            which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;About your age,&rdquo; Nan said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nearer my sister Jo&lsquo;s, I am seventeen in August,&rdquo; returned Meg, tossing her head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice of him to send you flowers, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Annie, looking wise about
            nothing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and we are so fond of them. My mother and
            old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know, so it is quite natural that we children should play together.&rdquo;
            And Meg hoped they would say no more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s evident Daisy isn&rsquo;t out yet,&rdquo; said Miss Clara to Belle with a nod.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round,&rdquo; returned Miss Belle with a shrug.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to get some little matters for my girls; can I do anything for you, young
            ladies?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, thank you, ma&lsquo;am,&rdquo; replied Sallie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my new pink silk for Thursday
            and don&rsquo;t want a thing.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nor I&mdash;&rdquo; began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things
            and could not have them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What shall you wear?&rdquo; asked Sallie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen; it got sadly torn last night,&rdquo; said
            Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling very uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you send home for another?&rdquo; said Sallie, who was not an observing young lady.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any other.&rdquo; It cost Meg an effort to say that, but Sallie did not see it and
            exclaimed in amiable surprise, &ldquo;Only that? How funny&mdash;&rdquo; She did not finish her speech, for
            Belle shook her head at her and broke in, saying kindly&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not at all; where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn&rsquo;t out? There&rsquo;s no
            need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had a dozen, for I&rsquo;ve got a sweet blue silk laid away, which
            I&rsquo;ve outgrown, and you shall wear it to please me, won&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are very kind, but I don&rsquo;t mind my old dress if you don&lsquo;t, it does well enough for a
            little girl like me,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to do it, and you&rsquo;d be a
            regular little beauty with a touch here and there. I shan&rsquo;t let anyone see you till you are done, and
            then we&rsquo;ll burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball,&rdquo; said Belle in
            her persuasive tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg couldn&rsquo;t refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if she would be &ldquo;a little
            beauty&rdquo; after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward
            the Moffats.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and between them they turned Meg into a fine
            lady. They crimped and curled her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder, touched
            her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense would have added &ldquo;a
            soup&ccedil;on<u><sup>ay</sup></u> of rouge,&rdquo; if Meg had not rebelled. They laced her into a sky-blue
            dress, which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself
            in the mirror. A set of silver filigree was added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, and even earrings, for
            Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show. A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom
            and a ruche,<u><sup>az</sup></u> reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty white shoulders, and a pair of
            high-heeled blue silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart. A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a
            bouquet in a silver holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little
            girl with a newly dressed doll.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle is charmante, tr&egrave;s jolie,<u><sup>ba</sup></u> is she not?&rdquo; cried Hortense,
            clasping her hands in an affected rapture.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Come and show yourself,&rdquo; said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room where the others were
            waiting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her earrings tinkling, her curls waving, and her
            heart beating, she felt as if her &ldquo;fun&rdquo; had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly
            told her that she was &ldquo;a little beauty.&rdquo; Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase
            enthusiastically, and for several minutes she stood, like the jackdaw in the fable,<u><sup>bb</sup></u>
            enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like a party of magpies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt and those French heels, or she
            will trip herself up. Take your silver butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head,
            Clara, and don&rsquo;t any of you disturb the charming work of my hands,&rdquo; said Belle, as she hurried
            away, looking well pleased with her success.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to go down, I feel so queer and stiff and half-dressed,&rdquo; said Meg to Sallie, as
            the bell rang, and Mrs. Moffat sent to ask the young ladies to appear at once.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I&rsquo;m nowhere beside you, for
            Belle has heaps of taste, and you&rsquo;re quite French, I assure you. Let your flowers hang, don&rsquo;t be
            so careful of them, and be sure you don&rsquo;t trip,&rdquo; returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg
            was prettier than herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely downstairs and sailed into the drawing rooms
            where the Moffats and a few early guests were assembled. She very soon discovered that there is a charm
            about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect. Several young ladies,
            who had taken no notice of her before, were very affectionate all of a sudden; several young gentlemen, who
            had only stared at her at the other party, now not only stared, but asked to be introduced, and said all
            manner of foolish but agreeable things to her; and several old ladies, who sat on sofas, and criticized the
            rest of the party, inquired who she was with an air of interest. She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Daisy March&mdash;father a colonel in the army&mdash;one of our first families, but reverses of
            fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences; sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild
            about her.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the old lady, putting up her glass for another observation of Meg, who tried to
            look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat&rsquo;s fibs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The &ldquo;queer feeling&rdquo; did not pass away, but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady
            and so got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the train kept getting under her
            feet, and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken. She was flirting
            her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty, when she suddenly
            stopped laughing and looked confused, for, just opposite, she saw Laurie. He was staring at her with
            undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she thought, for, though he bowed and smiled, yet something in
            his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on. To complete her confusion, she saw Belle
            nudge Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to see, looked unusually boyish and shy.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head. I won&rsquo;t care for it, or let it change me a
            bit,&rdquo; thought Meg, and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn&lsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, with her most grown-up air.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did,&rdquo; answered Laurie, without turning
            his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her maternal tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What shall you tell her?&rdquo; asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his opinion of her, yet feeling
            ill at ease with him for the first time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall say I didn&rsquo;t know you, for you look so grown-up and unlike yourself, I&rsquo;m quite
            afraid of you,&rdquo; he said, fumbling at his glove button.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How absurd of you! The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like it. Wouldn&rsquo;t Jo stare if
            she saw me?&rdquo; said Meg, bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think she would,&rdquo; returned Laurie gravely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like me so?&rdquo; asked Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I don&lsquo;t,&rdquo; was the blunt reply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; in an anxious tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He glanced at her frizzled<u><sup>bc</sup></u> head, bare shoulders, and fantastically trimmed dress with an
            expression that abashed her more than his answer, which had not a particle of his usual politeness about it.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like fuss and feathers.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg walked away, saying petulantly,
            &ldquo;You are the rudest boy I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks, for the tight dress gave
            her an uncomfortably brilliant color. As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and a minute after she
            heard him saying to his mother&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They are making a fool of that little girl; I wanted you to see her, but they have spoiled her
            entirely; she&rsquo;s nothing but a doll tonight.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed Meg. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d been sensible and worn my own things, then I
            should not have disgusted other people, or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed myself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the curtains, never minding that her
            favorite waltz had begun, till someone touched her; and, turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he
            said, with his very best bow and his hand out&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,&rdquo; said Meg, trying to look offended and
            failing entirely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it, I&rsquo;m dying to do it. Come, I&rsquo;ll be good. I don&rsquo;t like your gown, but
            I do think you are&mdash;just splendid.&rdquo; And he waved his hands, as if words failed to express his
            admiration.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time, &ldquo;Take care my skirt
            doesn&rsquo;t trip you up; it&rsquo;s the plague of my life and I was a goose to wear it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,&rdquo; said Laurie, looking down at the little
            blue boots, which he evidently approved of.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Away they went fleedy and gracefully, for, having practiced at home, they were well matched, and the blithe
            young couple were a pleasant sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more friendly
            than ever after their small tiff.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?&rdquo; said Meg, as he stood fanning her when her
            breath gave out, which it did very soon though she would not own why.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t I!&rdquo; said Laurie, with alacrity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t tell them at home about my dress tonight. They won&rsquo;t understand the joke, and
            it will worry Mother.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then why did you do it?&rdquo; said Laurie&rsquo;s eyes, so plainly that
            Meg hastily added&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall tell them myself all about it, and &lsquo;fess&rsquo; to Mother how silly I&rsquo;ve been. But
            I&rsquo;d rather do it myself; so you&rsquo;ll not tell, will you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I give you my word I
            won&lsquo;t, only what shall I say when they ask me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just say I looked pretty well and was
            having a good time.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say the first with all my heart, but how about the other? You don&rsquo;t look as if you
            were having a good time. Are you?&rdquo; And Laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer
            in a whisper&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, not just now. Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m horrid. I only wanted a little fun, but this sort
            doesn&rsquo;t pay, I find, and I&rsquo;m getting tired of it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here comes Ned Moffat; what does he want?&rdquo; said Laurie, knitting his black brows as if he did
            not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he&rsquo;s coming for them. What a bore!&rdquo;
            said Meg, assuming a languid air which amused Laurie immensely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw her drinking champagne with Ned and his friend
            Fisher, who were behaving &ldquo;like a pair of fools,&rdquo; as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a
            brotherly sort of right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of that. I wouldn&lsquo;t, Meg,
            your mother doesn&rsquo;t like it, you know,&rdquo; he whispered, leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to
            refill her glass and Fisher stooped to pick up her fan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Meg tonight, I&rsquo;m &lsquo;a doll&rsquo; who does all sorts of crazy things. Tomorrow
            I shall put away my &rsquo;fuss and feathers&rsquo; and be desperately good again,&rdquo; she answered with
            an affected little laugh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Wish tomorrow was here, then,&rdquo; muttered Laurie, walking off, ill-pleased at the change he saw in
            her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did; after supper she undertook the
            German,<u><sup>bd</sup></u> and blundered through it, nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and
            romping in a way that scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture. But he got no chance to
            deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say good night.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Remember!&rdquo; she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had already begun.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Silence &agrave; la mort,&rdquo; <u><sup>be</sup></u>replied Laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as
            he went away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This little bit of byplay excited Annie&rsquo;s curiosity, but Meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed,
            feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and hadn&rsquo;t enjoyed herself as much as she expected. She was
            sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with her fortnight&rsquo;s fun and feeling
            that she had &ldquo;sat in the lap of luxury&rdquo; long enough.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all the time. Home is a nice place,
            though it isn&rsquo;t splendid,&rdquo; said Meg, looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat
            with her mother and Jo on the Sunday evening.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after
            your fine quarters,&rdquo; replied her mother, who had given her many anxious looks that day; for motherly
            eyes are quick to see any change in children&rsquo;s faces.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had, but something
            still seemed to weigh upon her spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat thoughtfully
            staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried. As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg
            suddenly left her chair and, taking Beth&rsquo;s stool, leaned her elbows on her mother&rsquo;s knee, saying
            bravely&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Marmee, I want to &lsquo;fess.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought so; what is it, dear?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Shall I go away?&rdquo; asked Jo discreetly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course not. Don&rsquo;t I always tell you everything? I was ashamed to speak of it before the
            children, but I want you to know all the dreadful things I did at the Moffats&lsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We are prepared,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little anxious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I told you they dressed me up, but I didn&rsquo;t tell you that they powdered and squeezed and
            frizzled, and made me look like a fashion plate. Laurie thought I wasn&rsquo;t proper. I know he did, though
            he didn&rsquo;t say so, and one man called me &lsquo;a doll.&rsquo; I knew it was silly, but they flattered
            me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty
            daughter, and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was altogether abominable,&rdquo; said Meg
            self-reproachfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There is something more, I think.&rdquo; And Mrs. March smoothed the soft cheek, which suddenly grew
            rosy as Meg answered slowly&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have people say and think such
            things about us and Laurie.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats&lsquo;, and as she spoke, Jo saw her
            mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg&rsquo;s innocent
            mind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, if that isn&rsquo;t the greatest rubbish I ever heard,&rdquo; cried Jo indignantly. &ldquo;Why
            didn&rsquo;t you pop out and tell them so on the spot?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I couldn&lsquo;t, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn&rsquo;t help hearing at first, and then I
            was so angry and ashamed, I didn&rsquo;t remember that I ought to go away.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I&rsquo;ll show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff. The
            idea of having &lsquo;plans,&rsquo; and being kind to Laurie because he&rsquo;s rich and may marry us
            by-and-by! Won&rsquo;t he shout when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children?&rdquo;
            And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you tell Laurie, I&rsquo;ll never forgive you! She mustn&lsquo;t, must she, Mother?&rdquo; said
            Meg, looking distressed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you can,&rdquo; said Mrs. March
            gravely. &ldquo;I was very unwise to let you go among people of whom I know so little&mdash;kind, I dare
            say, but worldly, ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people. I am more sorry than I can
            express for the mischief this visit may have done you, Meg.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry, I won&rsquo;t let it hurt me. I&rsquo;ll forget all the bad and remember only
            the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you very much for letting me go. I&rsquo;ll not be
            sentimental or dissatisfied, Mother. I know I&rsquo;m a silly little girl, and I&rsquo;ll stay with you till
            I&rsquo;m fit to take care of myself. But it is nice to be praised and admired, and I can&rsquo;t help
            saying I like it,&rdquo; said Meg, looking half ashamed of the confession.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to
            do foolish or unmaidenly things. Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite the
            admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty, Meg.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind her, looking both interested and a
            little perplexed, for it was a new thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and
            things of that sort; and Jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly, and was
            drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother, do you have &lsquo;plans,&rsquo; as Mrs. Moffat said?&rdquo; asked Meg bashfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, I have a great many; all mothers do, but mine differ somewhat from Mrs. Moffat&lsquo;s,
            I suspect. I will tell you some of them, for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head
            and heart of yours right, on a very serious subject. You are young, Meg, but not too young to understand me,
            and mothers&rsquo; lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you. Jo, your turn will come
            in time, perhaps, so listen to my &lsquo;plans,&rsquo; and help me carry them out, if they are good.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very
            solemn affair. Holding a hand of each, and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her
            serious yet cheery way&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good; to be admired, loved, and respected; to
            have a happy youth, to be well and wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care
            and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and
            sweetest thing which can happen to a woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful
            experience. It is natural to think of it, Meg, right to hope and wait for it, and wise to prepare for it, so
            that when the happy time comes, you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy. My dear girls, I am
            ambitious for you, but not to have you make a dash in the world&mdash;marry rich men merely because they are
            rich, or have splendid houses, which are not homes because love is wanting. Money is a needful and precious
            thing&mdash;and, when well used, a noble thing&mdash;but I never want you to think it is the first or only
            prize to strive for. I&rsquo;d rather see you poor men&rsquo;s wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented,
            than queens on thrones, without self-respect and peace.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Poor girls don&rsquo;t stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put themselves forward,&rdquo; sighed
            Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll be old maids,&rdquo; said Jo stoutly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Right, Jo; better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or unmaidenly girls, running about to find
            husbands,&rdquo; said Mrs. March decidedly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a
            sincere lover. Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls, but so love-worthy that they
            were not allowed to be old maids. Leave these things to time; make this home happy, so that you may be fit
            for homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they are not. One thing remember, my
            girls: Mother is always ready to be your confidante, Father to be your friend; and both of us trust and hope
            that our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort of our lives.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We will, Marmee, we will!&rdquo; cried both, with all their hearts, as she bade them good night.</p>

        <p>The P. C. and P. O.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the lengthening days gave long afternoons
            for work and play of all sorts. The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the
            little plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d know which each of them gardings
            belonged to, ef I see &lsquo;em in Chiny;&rdquo; and so she might, for the girls&rsquo; tastes differed as
            much as their characters. Meg&rsquo;s had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it.
            Jo&rsquo;s bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying experiments; this year it was to be a
            plantation of sunflowers, the seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed Aunt Cockle-top and
            her family of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned, fragrant flowers in her garden&mdash;sweet peas and
            mignonette, larkspur, pinks, pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the bird and catnip for the
            pussies. Amy had a bower in hers&mdash;rather small and earwiggy, but very pretty to look at&mdash;with
            honeysuckles and morning-glories hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall
            white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed the fine days, and for rainy ones, they had
            house diversions&mdash;some old, some new&mdash;all more or less original. One of these was the &ldquo;P.
            C.,&rdquo; for as secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one; and as all of the
            girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the Pickwick Club.<u><sup>bf</sup></u> With a few
            interruptions, they had kept this up for a year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which
            occasions the ceremonies were as follows: Three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a
            lamp, also four white badges, with a big &ldquo;P. C.&rdquo; in different colors on each, and the weekly
            newspaper called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed something, while Jo, who reveled in pens
            and ink, was the editor. At seven o&lsquo;clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom, tied their
            badges round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity. Meg, as the eldest, was Samuel
            Pickwick; Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus Snodgrass; Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy
            Tupman; and Amy, who was always trying to do what she couldn&rsquo;t, was Nathaniel Winkle.<sup>*</sup>
            Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original tales, poetry, local news, funny
            advertisements, and hints, in which they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and
            shortcomings. On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glasses, rapped upon the
            table, hemmed, and, having stared hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he arranged
            himself properly, began to read:</p>

        <p>Next our peaceful Tupman comes, So rosy, plump, and sweet, Who chokes with laughter at the puns, And tumbles
            off his seat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Prim little Winkle too is here, With every hair in place, A model of propriety, Though he hates to wash his
            face.</p>

        <p>The year is gone, we still unite To joke and laugh and read, And tread the path of literature That doth to

        <p>THE MASKED MARRIAGE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A TALE OF VENICE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps, and left its lovely load to swell the brilliant</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>moonlight, broke the hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus: &ldquo;My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by
            which I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we wait your services.&rdquo;
            All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a low murmur of amazement went through the throng, for neither
            bride nor groom removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained all
            tongues till the holy rite was over. Then the eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding an
            explanation. &ldquo;Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only know that it was the whim of my timid
            Viola, and I yielded to it. Now, my children, let the play end. Unmask and receive my</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our Pickwick, always at his post, With reverence we greet, As, spectacles on nose, he reads Our well-filled
            weekly sheet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although he suffers from a cold, We joy to hear him speak, For words of wisdom from him fall, In spite of
            croak or squeak.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high, With elephantine grace, And beams upon the company, With brown and
            jovial face.</p>

        <p>all report their adventures and observations at club meetings.</p>

        <p>throng that filled the stately halls of Count de Adelon. Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks and
            flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance. Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so with mirth
            and music the mas querade went on. &ldquo;Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola tonight?&rdquo; asked a gal
            lant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm. &ldquo;Yes, is she not lovely,
            though so sad! Her dress is well chosen, too, for in a week she weds Count Antonio, whom she pas sionately
            hates.&rdquo; &ldquo;By my faith, I envy him. Yon der he comes, arrayed like a bridegroom, except the black
            mask. When that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her stern
            father bestows her hand,&rdquo; returned the trouba dour. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis whispered that she loves the
            young English artist who haunts her steps, and is spurned by the old count,&rdquo; said the lady, as they
            joined the dance. The revel was at its height when a priest appeared, and, withdrawing the young pair to an
            alcove hung with purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel. Instant silence fell upon the gay throng; and not
            a sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the Count Antonio. I can do more, for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux and De
            Vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady,
            now my wife.&rdquo; The count stood like one changed to stone, and turning to the bewildered crowd, Ferdi
            nand added, with a gay smile of triumph, &ldquo;To you, my gallant friends, I can only wish that your wooing
            may prosper as mine has done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have by this masked
            marriage.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>WEEKLY REPORT</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg&mdash;Good. Jo&mdash;Bad. Beth&mdash;Very good. Amy&mdash;Middling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of
            one written by bona fide girls once upon a time), a round of applause followed, and then Mr. Snodgrass rose
            to make a proposition.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mr. President and gentlemen,&rdquo; he began, assuming a parliamentary attitude and tone, &ldquo;I
            wish to propose the admission of a new member&mdash;one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply
            grateful for it, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club, the literary value of the paper, and be
            no end jolly and nice. I propose Mr. Theodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P. C. Come now, do have
            him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo&rsquo;s sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all looked rather anxious, and no one said a word
            as Snodgrass took his seat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put it to vote,&rdquo; said the President. &ldquo;All in
            favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying, &lsquo;Aye.&rsquo; &rdquo; A loud response from
            Snodgrass, followed, to everybody&rsquo;s surprise, by a timid one from Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Contrary-minded say, &lsquo;No.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to say with great elegance, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t wish
            any boys, they only joke and bounce about. This is a ladies&rsquo; club, and we wish to be private and
            proper.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us afterward,&rdquo; observed
            Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she always did when doubtful.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest. &ldquo;Sir, I give you my word as a gentleman, Laurie won&rsquo;t do
            anything of the sort. He likes to write, and he&rsquo;ll give a tone to our contributions and keep us from
            being sentimental, don&rsquo;t you see? We can do so little for him, and he does so much for us, I think the
            least we can do is to offer him a place here, and make him welcome if he comes.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his feet, looking as if he had quite made up his
            mind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, we ought to do it, even if we are afraid. I say he may come, and his grandpa, too, if he
            likes.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly.
            &ldquo;Now then, vote again. Everybody remember it&rsquo;s our Laurie, and say, &lsquo;Aye!&rdquo;&rsquo;
            cried Snodgrass excitedly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Aye! aye! aye!&rdquo; replied three voices at once.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good! Bless you! Now, as there&rsquo;s nothing like &lsquo;taking time by the fetlock,&rsquo; as
            Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present the new member.&rdquo; And, to the dismay of the
            rest of the club, Jo threw open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag bag, flushed
            and twinkling with suppressed laughter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You rogue! You traitor! Jo, how could you?&rdquo; cried the three girls, as Snodgrass led her friend
            triumphantly forth, and producing both a chair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The coolness of you two rascals is amazing,&rdquo; began Mr. Pickwick, trying to get up an awful frown
            and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile. But the new member was equal to the occasion, and rising,
            with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said in the most engaging manner, &ldquo;Mr. President and
            ladies&mdash;I beg pardon, gentlemen&mdash;allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller,<u><sup>bg</sup></u>
            the very humble servant of the club.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good! Good!&rdquo; cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming pan on which she leaned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My faithful friend and noble patron,&rdquo; continued Laurie with a wave of the hand, &ldquo;who has
            so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight. I planned it, and she
            only gave in after lots of teasing.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Come now, don&rsquo;t lay it all on yourself; you know I proposed the cupboard,&rdquo; broke in
            Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Never you mind what she says. I&rsquo;m the wretch that did it, sir,&rdquo; said the new member, with
            a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick. &ldquo;But on my honor, I never will do so again, and henceforth dewote
            myself to the interest of this immortal club.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan<u><sup>bh</sup></u> like a cymbal,
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Go on, go on!&rdquo; added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed benignly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me, and as a means of
            promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the
            lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for
            the mails&mdash;also the females, if I may be allowed the expression. It&rsquo;s the old martin
            house,<u><sup>bi</sup></u> but I&rsquo;ve stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it will hold all
            sorts of things and save our valuable time. Letters, manuscripts, books, and bundles can be passed in there,
            and as each nation has a key, it will be uncommonly nice, I fancy. Allow me to present the club key, and
            with many thanks for your favor, take my seat.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided, the warming pan clashed and
            waved wildly, and it was some time before order could be restored. A long discussion followed, and everyone
            came out surprising, for everyone did her best; so it was an unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn
            till a late hour, when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member. No one ever regretted the
            admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted, well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He
            certainly did add &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; to the meetings, and &ldquo;a tone&rdquo; to the paper, for his
            orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent, being patriotic, classical, comical, or
            dramatic, but never sentimental. Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton,<u><sup>bj</sup></u> or
            Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she thought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things
            passed through it as through the real office. Tragedies and cravats,<u><sup>bk</sup></u> poetry and pickles,
            garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers, invitations, scoldings, and puppies. The old
            gentleman liked the fun, and amused himself by sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, and funny
            telegrams; and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah&rsquo;s charms, actually sent a love letter to
            Jo&rsquo;s care. How they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming how many love letters that little
            post office would hold in the years to come!</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Experiments</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first of June! The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow, and I&rsquo;m free. Three months&rsquo;
            vacation&mdash;how I shall enjoy it!&rdquo; exclaimed Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the
            sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and Amy made lemonade for the
            refreshment of the whole party.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!&rdquo; said Jo. &ldquo;I was mortally afraid
            she&rsquo;d ask me to go with her; if she had, I should have felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is
            about as gay as a churchyard, <u><sup>4</sup></u> you know, and I&rsquo;d rather be excused. We had a flurry
            getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to me, for I was in such a hurry to be
            through that I was uncommonly helpful and sweet, and feared she&rsquo;d find it impossible to part from me.
            I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright, for as it drove off, she popped out
            her head, saying, &lsquo;Josyphine, won&rsquo;t you&mdash;?&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t hear any more, for I
            basely turned and fled. I did actually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Poor old Jo! She came in looking as if bears were after her,&rdquo; said Beth, as she cuddled her
            sister&rsquo;s feet with a motherly air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?&rdquo; observed Amy, tasting her mixture critically.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter; it&rsquo;s too warm to be particular
            about one&rsquo;s parts of speech,&rdquo; murmured Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What shall you do all your vacation?&rdquo; asked Amy, changing the subject with tact.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall lie abed late, and do nothing,&rdquo; replied Meg, from the depths of the rocking chair.
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been routed up early all winter and had to spend my days working for other people, so now
            I&rsquo;m going to rest and revel to my heart&rsquo;s content.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jo, &ldquo;that dozy way wouldn&rsquo;t suit me. I&rsquo;ve laid in a heap of books,
            and I&rsquo;m going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old apple tree, when I&rsquo;m
            not having 1&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;larks!&rdquo;&rsquo; implored Amy, as a return snub for the
            &ldquo;samphire&rdquo; correction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;nightingales,&rsquo; then, with Laurie; that&rsquo;s proper and appropriate,
            since he&rsquo;s a warbler.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time and rest, as the girls
            mean to,&rdquo; proposed Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I will, if Mother doesn&rsquo;t mind. I want to learn some new songs, and my children need
            fitting up for the summer; they are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;May we, Mother?&rdquo; asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in what they called
            &ldquo;Marmee&rsquo;s corner.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it. I think by Saturday night you will
            find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no! It will be delicious, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Meg complacently.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I now propose a toast, as my &lsquo;friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp,&rsquo;<u><sup>bl</sup></u> says.
            Fun forever, and no grubbing!&rdquo;<u><sup>bm</sup></u> cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the lemonade
            went round.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day. Next morning, Meg
            did not appear till ten o&lsquo;clock; her solitary breakfast did not taste nice, and the room seemed lonely
            and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy&rsquo;s books lay scattered about.
            Nothing was neat and pleasant but &ldquo;Marmee&rsquo;s corner,&rdquo; which looked as usual; and there Meg
            sat, to &ldquo;rest and read,&rdquo; which meant yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get
            with her salary. Jo spent the morning on the river with Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The
            Wide, Wide World, <u><sup>bn</sup></u> up in the apple tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out of the
            big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before half done, she left her establishment
            topsy-turvy and went to her music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on
            her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw under the honeysuckles, hoping someone would
            see and inquire who the young artist was. As no one appeared but an inquisitive daddy-longlegs, who examined
            her work with interest, she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a delightful, though unusually long day. Meg,
            who went shopping in the afternoon and got a &ldquo;sweet blue muslin,&rdquo; had discovered, after she had
            cut the breadths off, that it wouldn&rsquo;t wash, which mishap made her slightly cross. Jo had burned the
            skin off her nose boating, and got a raging headache by reading too long. Beth was worried by the confusion
            of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once, and Amy deeply regretted the
            damage done her frock, for Katy Brown&rsquo;s party was to be the next day and now, like Flora McFlimsey,
            she had &ldquo;nothing to wear.&rdquo;<u><sup>bo</sup></u> But these were mere trifles, and they assured
            their mother that the experiment was working finely. She smiled, said nothing, and with Hannah&rsquo;s help
            did their neglected work, keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly. It was
            astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the &ldquo;resting and
            reveling&rdquo; process. The days kept getting longer and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so
            were tempers, an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands
            to do. As the height of luxury, Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily that she
            fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up &agrave; la Moffat. Jo read
            till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a quarrel
            with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with Aunt March. Beth got on
            pretty well, for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work, and fell back into
            her old ways now and then; but something in the air affected her, and more than once her tranquillity was
            much disturbed&mdash;so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her she
            was &ldquo;a fright.&rdquo; Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were small, and when her sisters left
            her to amuse and care for herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great
            burden. She didn&rsquo;t like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn&rsquo;t draw all the time;
            tea parties didn&rsquo;t amount to much, neither did picnics unless very well conducted. &ldquo;If one could
            have a fine house, full of nice girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at home
            with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz,&rdquo; complained
            Miss Malaprop,<u><sup>bp</sup></u> after several days devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday night each acknowledged to herself
            that she was glad the week was nearly done. Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who had a
            good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday
            and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen, no breakfast in the dining room, and
            no mother anywhere to be seen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mercy on us! What has happened?&rdquo; cried Jo, staring about her in dismay.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather bewildered, and a little ashamed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother isn&rsquo;t sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all
            day and let us do the best we can. It&rsquo;s a very queer thing for her to do, she doesn&rsquo;t act a bit
            like herself; but she says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn&rsquo;t grumble but take care of
            ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy enough, and I like the idea, I&rsquo;m aching for something to do&mdash;that is,
            some new amusement, you know,&rdquo; added Jo quickly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, and they took hold with a will, but soon
            realized the truth of Hannah&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;Housekeeping ain&rsquo;t no joke.&rdquo; There was
            plenty of food in the larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast, wondering as
            they did so why servants ever talked about hard work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not to think of her, for she&rsquo;d take care
            of herself,&rdquo; said Meg, who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the cook&rsquo;s compliments. The boiled tea
            was very bitter, the omelet scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus,<u><sup>bq</sup></u> but Mrs.
            March received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo was gone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I&rsquo;m afraid, but they won&rsquo;t suffer, and it
            will do them good,&rdquo; she said, producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself,
            and disposing of the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt&mdash;a motherly little
            deception for which they were grateful.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures. &ldquo;Never mind,
            I&rsquo;ll get the dinner and be servant, you be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give
            orders,&rdquo; said Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to the parlor, which she hastily put in order
            by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting. Jo, with
            perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel, immediately put a note in the
            office, inviting Laurie to dinner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better see what you have got before you think of having company,&rdquo; said Meg, when
            informed of the hospitable but rash act.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s corned beef and plenty of potatoes, and I shall get some asparagus and a lobster,
            &lsquo;for a relish,&rsquo; as Hannah says. We&rsquo;ll have lettuce and make a salad. I don&rsquo;t know
            how, but the book tells. I&rsquo;ll have blancmange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee, too, if you
            want to be elegant.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try too many messes, Jo, for you can&rsquo;t make anything but gingerbread and molasses
            candy fit to eat. I wash my hands of the dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own
            responsibility, you may just take care of him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding. You&rsquo;ll give
            me your advice if I get in a muddle, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Jo, rather hurt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t know much, except about bread and a few trifles. You had better ask
            Mother&rsquo;s leave before you order anything,&rdquo; returned Meg prudently.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course I shall. I&rsquo;m not a fool.&rdquo; And Jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of
            her powers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Get what you like, and don&rsquo;t disturb me. I&rsquo;m going out to dinner and can&rsquo;t worry
            about things at home,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to her. &rdquo;I never enjoyed housekeeping, and
            I&rsquo;m going to take a vacation today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning made Jo feel as
            if some natural phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic eruption would hardly
            have seemed stranger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Everything is out of sorts, somehow,&rdquo; she said to herself, going downstairs.
            &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Beth crying, that&rsquo;s a sure sign that something is wrong with this family. If Amy
            is bothering, I&rsquo;ll shake her.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary,
            who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for want of
            which he had died.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault&mdash;I forgot him&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t a seed or a drop left. Oh, Pip! Oh,
            Pip! How could I be so cruel to you?&rdquo; cried Beth, taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to
            restore him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding him stiff and cold, shook her head, and
            offered her domino box for a coffin.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive,&rdquo; said Amy hopefully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been starved, and he shan&rsquo;t be baked now he&rsquo;s dead. I&rsquo;ll make him a
            shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I&rsquo;ll never have another bird, never, my Pip! For I
            am too bad to own one,&rdquo; murmured Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go. Now, don&rsquo;t cry, Bethy; it&rsquo;s a
            pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has had the worst of the experiment. Make the shroud and lay
            him in my box, and after the dinner party, we&rsquo;ll have a nice little funeral,&rdquo; said Jo, beginning
            to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which was in a most discouraging state of
            confusion. Putting on a big apron, she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when she
            discovered that the fire was out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a sweet prospect!&rdquo; muttered Jo, slamming the stove door open, and poking vigorously
            among the cinders.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the water heated. The walk revived her
            spirits, and flattering herself that she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a very
            young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid strawberries. By the time she got cleared up,
            the dinner arrived, and the stove was red-hot. Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had worked it up
            early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and forgotten it. Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in
            the parlor, when the door flew open and a floury, crocky,<u><sup>br</sup></u> flushed, and disheveled figure
            appeared, demanding tartly&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I say, isn&rsquo;t bread &lsquo;riz&rsquo; enough when it runs over the pans?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go, which caused the
            apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay. Mrs. March went out, after
            peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a
            winding sheet, while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box. A strange sense of helplessness fell
            upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes
            later Miss Crocker appeared, and said she&rsquo;d come to dinner. Now, this lady was a thin, yellow
            spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw. They
            disliked her, but had been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and had few
            friends. So Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her, while she asked questions, criticized
            everything, and told stories of the people whom she knew.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions which Jo underwent that morning, and the
            dinner she served up became a standing joke. Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone, and
            discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook. She boiled the
            asparagus for an hour and was grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever. The
            bread turned black,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she let everything else go till she had convinced herself that
            she could not make it fit to eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but she hammered and poked till
            it was unshelled and its meager proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves. The potatoes had to be
            hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at last. The blancmange was lumpy, and the
            strawberries not as ripe as they looked, having been skillfully &ldquo;deaconed.&rdquo;<u><sup>bs</sup></u>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are hungry, only it&rsquo;s mortifying to have
            to spend your whole morning for nothing,&rdquo; thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than
            usual, and stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread for Laurie, accustomed to all sorts
            of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose curious eyes would mark all failures and whose tattling tongue would
            report them far and wide.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after another was tasted and left, while Amy
            giggled, Meg looked distressed, Miss Crocker pursed up her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all his
            might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. Jo&rsquo;s one strong point was the fruit, for she had
            sugared it well, and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it. Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle, and she
            drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy
            islands floating in a sea of cream. Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some water
            hastily. Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough, for they dwindled sadly after the picking
            over, glanced at Laurie, but he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his mouth
            and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked,
            hid her face in her napkin, and left the table precipitately.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, what is it?&rdquo; exclaimed Jo, trembling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour,&rdquo; replied Meg with a tragic gesture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the
            berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the
            refrigerator. She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when she met Laurie&rsquo;s eyes, which
            would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts; the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she
            laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. So did everyone else, even &ldquo;Croaker,&rdquo; as the girls
            called the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives and fun.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober ourselves with a
            funeral,&rdquo; said Jo, as they rose; and Miss Crocker made ready to go, being eager to tell the new story
            at another friend&rsquo;s dinner table.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They did sober themselves for Beth&rsquo;s sake; Laurie dug a grave under the ferns in the grove, little Pip
            was laid in, with many tears by his tenderhearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of violets
            and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph, composed by Jo while she struggled with the
            dinner:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here lies Pip March,</p>
        <p>Who died the 7th of June;</p>
        <p>Loved and lamented sore,</p>
        <p>And not forgotten soon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome with emotion and lobster; but there
            was no place of repose, for the beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up
            pillows and putting things in order. Meg helped Jo clear away the remains of the feast, which took half the
            afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper. Laurie took
            Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her
            temper. Mrs. March came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon, and
            a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was a scramble to get ready to see them;
            then tea must be got, errands done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected till the last minute.
            As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on the porch where the June roses were budding
            beautifully, and each groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What a dreadful day this has been!&rdquo; began Jo, usually the first to speak.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a bit like home,&rdquo; added Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t seem so without Marmee and little Pip,&rdquo; sighed Beth, glancing with full eyes at
            the empty cage above her head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, if you want it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them, looking as if her holiday had not been much
            pleasanter than theirs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another week of it?&rdquo; she asked, as
            Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the
            sun.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&lsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Jo decidedly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; echoed the others.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You think, then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others, do you?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Lounging and larking doesn&rsquo;t pay,&rdquo; observed Jo, shaking her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired
            of it and mean to go to work at something right off.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Suppose you learn plain cooking; that&rsquo;s a useful accomplishment, which no woman should be
            without,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly at the recollection of Jo&rsquo;s dinner party, for she
            had met Miss Crocker and heard her account of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we&rsquo;d get on?&rdquo; cried Meg,
            who had had suspicions all day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully. While
            Hannah and I did your work, you got on pretty well, though I don&rsquo;t think you were very happy or
            amiable; so I thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of
            herself. Don&rsquo;t you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another, to have daily duties which make
            leisure sweet when it comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and lovely to us
            all?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We do, Mother, we do!&rdquo; cried the girls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, for though they seem heavy sometimes,
            they are good for us, and lighten as we learn to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for
            everyone; it keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power
            and independence better than money or fashion.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don&lsquo;t!&rdquo; said Jo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
            learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the next dinner party I have shall be a success.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the set of shirts for Father, instead of letting you do it, Marmee. I can and I will,
            though I&rsquo;m not fond of sewing; that will be better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty
            nice enough as they are,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music and dolls. I am a stupid
            thing, and ought to be studying, not playing,&rdquo; was</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth&rsquo;s resolution, while Amy followed their example by heroically declaring, &ldquo;I shall learn to
            make buttonholes, and attend to my parts of speech.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Very good! Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy that we shall not have to repeat
            it, only don&rsquo;t go to the other extreme and delve like slaves. Have regular hours for work and play,
            make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it
            well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in
            spite of poverty.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll remember, Mother!&rdquo; And they did.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>12</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Camp Laurence</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she could attend to it regularly, and dearly liked the daily
            task of unlocking the little door and distributing the mail. One July day she came in with her hands full,
            and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the penny post.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your posy, Mother! Laurie never forgets that,&rdquo; she said, putting the fresh nosegay
            in the vase that stood in &ldquo;Marmee&rsquo;s corner&rdquo; and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove,&rdquo; continued Beth, delivering the articles to her sister,
            who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands. &ldquo;Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only
            one,&rdquo; said Meg, looking at the gray cotton glove. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you drop the other in the
            garden?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure I didn&lsquo;t, for there was only one in the office.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hate to have odd gloves! Never mind, the other may be found. My letter is only a translation of the
            German song I wanted. I think Mr. Brooke did it, for this isn&rsquo;t Laurie&rsquo;s writing.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham morning gown, with the little curls
            blowing about her forehead, and very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable, full of tidy white
            rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her mother&rsquo;s mind as she sewed and sang, while her fingers
            flew and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt,
            that Mrs. March smiled and was satisfied.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered the whole post office, stuck
            outside,&rdquo; said Beth, laughing as she went into the study where Jo sat writing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were the fashion, because I burn my face
            every hot day. He said, &lsquo;Why mind the fashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!&rsquo; I said I
            would if I had one, and he has sent me this to try me. I&rsquo;ll wear it for fun, and show him I
            don&rsquo;t care for the fashion.&rdquo; And hanging the antique broadbrim on a bust of
            Plato,<u><sup>bt</sup></u> Jo read her letters.</p>
        <p>One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said to her&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MY DEAR:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I watch your efforts to control your temper. You
            say nothing about your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no one sees them but the
            Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may trust the well-worn cover of your guidebook. I, too, have seen
            them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. Go on,
            dear, patiently and bravely, and always believe that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your
            loving</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MOTHER.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That does me good! That&rsquo;s worth millions of money and pecks of praise. Oh, Marmee, I do try! I
            will keep on trying, and not get tired, since I have you to help me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears, for she had thought that no
            one saw and appreciated her efforts to be good, and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging,
            because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued. Feeling stronger than ever to
            meet and subdue her Apollyon, she pinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she be
            taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready for either good or bad news. In a big,
            dashing hand, Laurie wrote&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DEAR Jo,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What ho!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some English girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and I want to have a jolly time. If it&rsquo;s
            fine, I&rsquo;m going to pitch my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet-have a
            fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts of larks. They are nice people, and like such things. Brooke
            will go, to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for the girls. I want you all to come,
            can&rsquo;t let Beth off at any price, and nobody shall worry her. Don&rsquo;t bother about
            rations&mdash;I&rsquo;ll see to that and everything else&mdash;only do come, there&rsquo;s a good fellow!
        </p>
        <p>In a tearing hurry,</p>
        <p>Yours ever, LAURIE.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s richness!&rdquo; cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course we can go, Mother? It will be such a help to Laurie, for I can row, and Meg see to the
            lunch, and the children be useful in some way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hope the Vaughns are not fine, grown-up people. Do you know anything about them, Jo?&rdquo; asked
            Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and Frank (twins) about my age, and a
            little girl (Grace), who is nine or ten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys; I fancied, from the
            way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn&rsquo;t admire Kate much.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad my French print is clean, it&rsquo;s just the thing and so becoming!&rdquo; observed
            Meg complacently. &ldquo;Have you anything decent, Jo?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall row and tramp about, so I don&rsquo;t want
            any starch to think of. You&rsquo;ll come, Bethy?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t let any of the boys talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a boy!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I like to please Laurie, and I&rsquo;m not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so kind; but I don&rsquo;t want
            to play, or sing, or say anything. I&rsquo;ll work hard and not trouble anyone, and you&rsquo;ll take care
            of me, Jo, so I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my good girl; you do try to fight off your shyness, and I love you for it. Fighting
            faults isn&rsquo;t easy, as I know, and a cheery word kind of gives a lift.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thank you, Mother.&rdquo; And Jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March than if it
            had given back the rosy roundness of her youth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,&rdquo; said Amy, showing her mail.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to him tonight, before the lamps
            are lighted, and I shall go,&rdquo; added Beth, whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can play tomorrow with free
            minds,&rdquo; said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a broom.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the sun peeped into the girls&rsquo; room early next morning to promise them a fine day, he saw a
            comical sight. Each had made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an extra
            row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream,
            Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax
            by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature. It was one of the kind artists use to
            hold the paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose to which
            it was now put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo
            woke up and roused all her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy&rsquo;s ornament.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a lively bustle began in both houses.
            Beth, who was ready first, kept reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters&rsquo; toilets
            by frequent telegrams from the window.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket.
            Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock; I wish he would go, too. There&rsquo;s
            Laurie, looking like a sailor&mdash;nice boy! Oh, mercy me! Here&rsquo;s a carriage full of people&mdash;a
            tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful boys. One is lame; poor thing, he&rsquo;s got a crutch. Laurie
            didn&rsquo;t tell us that. Be quick, girls! It&rsquo;s getting late. Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare.
            Look, Meg, isn&rsquo;t that the man who bowed to you one day when we were shopping?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was at the mountains. There is Sallie; I&rsquo;m
            glad she got back in time. Am I all right, Jo?&rdquo; cried Meg in a flutter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat straight, it looks sentimental tipped that way
            and will fly off at the first puff. Now, then, come on!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It&rsquo;s too absurd! You shall not make a
            guy<u><sup>bu</sup></u> of yourself,&rdquo; remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied down with a red ribbon the
            broad-brimmed, old-fashioned leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I just will, though, for it&rsquo;s capital&mdash;so shady, light, and big. It will make fun, and I
            don&rsquo;t mind being a guy if I&rsquo;m comfortable.&rdquo; With that Jo marched straight away and the
            rest Hollowed&mdash;a bright little band of sisters, all looking their best in summer suits, with happy
            faces under the jaunty hatbrims.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner. The lawn was the reception
            room, and for several minutes a lively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate,
            though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would do well to imitate, and she was much
            flattered by Mr. Ned&rsquo;s assurances that he came especially to see her. Jo understood why Laurie
            &ldquo;primmed up his mouth&rdquo; when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a
            stand-off-don&lsquo;t-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other
            girls. Beth took an observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not
            &ldquo;dreadful,&rdquo; but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that account. Amy found Grace
            a well-mannered, merry little person, and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they
            suddenly became very good friends.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the party was soon embarked, and the two
            boats pushed off together, leaving Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore. Laurie and Jo rowed one boat,
            Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did his best to upset both by paddling
            about in a wherry<u><sup>bv</sup></u> like a disturbed water bug. Jo&rsquo;s funny hat deserved a vote of
            thanks, for it was of general utility: it broke the ice in the beginning by producing a laugh, it created
            quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro as she rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the
            whole party, if a shower came up, she said. Kate looked rather amazed at Jo&rsquo;s proceedings, especially
            as she exclaimed &ldquo;Christopher Columbus!&rdquo; when she lost her oar; and Laurie said, &ldquo;My dear
            fellow, did I hurt you?&rdquo; when he tripped over her feet in taking his place. But after putting up her
            glass to examine the queer girl several times, Miss Kate decided that she was &ldquo;odd, but rather
            clever,&rdquo; and smiled upon her from afar.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the rowers, who both admired the
            prospect and feathered their oars<u><sup>bw</sup></u> with uncommon &ldquo;skill and dexterity.&rdquo; Mr.
            Brooke was a grave, silent young man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his quiet
            manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful knowledge. He never talked to her much, but he
            looked at her a good deal, and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion. Ned, being in
            college, of course put on all the airs which fresh-men think it their bounden duty to assume; he was not
            very wise, but very good-natured, and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner
            was absorbed in keeping her white piqu&eacute;<u><sup>bx</sup></u> dress clean and chattering with the
            ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the wickets down by the time they arrived. A
            pleasant green field, with three wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for
            croquet.<u><sup>5</sup></u></p>
        <p>&ldquo;Welcome to Camp Laurence!&rdquo; said the young host, as they landed with exclamations of delight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Brooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the other fellows are staff officers, and you,
            ladies, are company. The tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room, this is the
            messroom and the third is the camp kitchen. Now, let&rsquo;s have a game before it gets hot, and then
            we&rsquo;ll see about dinner.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight. Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate,
            and Fred; Laurie took Sallie, Jo, and Ned. The English played well, but the Americans played better, and
            contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of &lsquo;76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had
            several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket and had missed the
            stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. Fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers, he
            gave a stroke, his ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was very near, and
            running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m through! Now, Miss Jo, I&rsquo;ll settle you, and get in first,&rdquo; cried the young
            gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You pushed it; I saw you; it&rsquo;s my turn now,&rdquo; said Jo sharply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Upon my word, I didn&rsquo;t move it; it rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is allowed; so stand off,
            please, and let me have a go at the stake.&rdquo; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t cheat in America, but you can, if
            you choose,&rdquo; said Jo angrily.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go!&rdquo; returned Fred, croqueting
            her ball far away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time, colored up to her forehead and stood a
            minute, hammering down a wicket with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out with
            much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and was a long time finding it among the bushes, but she came
            back, looking cool and quiet, and waited her turn patiently. It took several strokes to regain the place she
            had lost, and when she got there, the other side had nearly won, for Kate&rsquo;s ball was the last but one
            and lay near the stake.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;By George, it&rsquo;s all up with us! Good-by, Kate. Miss Jo owes me one, so you are finished,&rdquo;
            cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to see the finish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,&rdquo; said Jo, with a look that made the lad
            redden, &ldquo;especially when they beat them,&rdquo; she added, as, leaving Kate&rsquo;s ball untouched,
            she won the game by a clever stroke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn&rsquo;t do to exult over the defeat of his guests,
            and stopped in the middle of a cheer to whisper to his friend, &ldquo;Good for you, Jo! He did cheat, I saw
            him; we can&rsquo;t tell him so, but he won&rsquo;t do it again, take my word for it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, and said approvingly, &ldquo;It was
            dreadfully provoking, but you kept your temper, and I&rsquo;m so glad, Jo.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should certainly have boiled over
            if I hadn&rsquo;t stayed among the nettles till I got my rage under enough to hold my tongue. It&rsquo;s
            simmering now, so I hope he&rsquo;ll keep out of my way,&rdquo; returned Jo, biting her lips as she glowered
            at Fred from under her big hat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Time for lunch,&rdquo; said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch. &ldquo;Commissary general, will you make
            the fire and get water, while Miss March, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table? Who can make good
            coffee?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo can,&rdquo; said Meg, glad to recommend her sister. So Jo, feeling that her late lessons in cookery
            were to do her honor, went to preside over the coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the
            boys made a fire and got water from a spring near by. Miss Kate sketched and Frank talked to Beth, who was
            making little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and
            drinkables, prettily decorated with green leaves. Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone
            settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise develops wholesome
            appetites. A very merry lunch it was, for everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter
            startled a venerable horse who fed near by. There was a pleasing inequality in the table, which produced
            many mishaps to cups and plates, acorns dropped into the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments
            without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going on. Three
            white-headed children peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of
            the river with all his might and main.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s salt here, if you prefer it,&rdquo; said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer of berries.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you, I prefer spiders,&rdquo; she replied, fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a
            creamy death. &ldquo;How dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every
            way?&rdquo; added Jo, as they both laughed and ate out of one plate, the china having run short.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven&rsquo;t got over it yet. This is no credit to me,
            you know, I don&rsquo;t do anything; it&rsquo;s you and Meg and Brooke who make it go, and I&rsquo;m no end
            obliged to you. What shall we do when we can&rsquo;t eat any more?&rdquo; asked Laurie, feeling that his
            trump card had been played<u><sup>by</sup></u> when lunch was over.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Have games till it&rsquo;s cooler. I brought Authors<u><sup>bz</sup></u>, and I dare say Miss Kate
            knows something new and nice. Go and ask her; she&rsquo;s company, and you ought to stay with her
            more.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you company too? I thought she&rsquo;d suit Brooke, but he keeps talking to Meg, and Kate
            just stares at them through that ridiculous glass of hers. I&rsquo;m going, so you needn&rsquo;t try to
            preach propriety, for you can&rsquo;t do it, Jo.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and the boys could not, eat any more, they
            all adjourned to the drawing room to play Rig-marole.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as he pleases, only taking care to
            stop short at some exciting point, when the next takes it up and does the same. It&rsquo;s very funny when
            well done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over. Please start it, Mr.
            Brooke,&rdquo; said Kate, with a commanding air, which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much
            respect as any other gentleman.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke obediently began the story, with the
            handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune, for he had nothing but his sword
            and his shield. He traveled a long while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till he
            came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to anyone who would tame and train a fine
            but unbroken colt, of which he was very fond. The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely, for
            the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master, though he was freakish and wild.
            Every day, when he gave his lessons to this pet of the king&lsquo;s, the knight rode him through the city;
            and, as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had seen many times in his
            dreams, but never found. One day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous
            castle the lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old castle, and was told that several
            captive princesses were kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. The
            knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he was poor and could only go by each day, watching for
            the sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine. At last he resolved to get into the castle and ask
            how he could help them. He went and knocked; the great door flew open, and he beheld&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, &lsquo;At last! At
            last!&rdquo;&rsquo; continued Kate, who had read French novels, and admired the style. &ldquo; &rdquo; Tis
            she!&lsquo; cried Count Gustave, and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy. &lsquo;Oh, rise!&rsquo; she
            said, extending a hand of marble fairness. &lsquo;Never! till you tell me how I may rescue you,&rsquo; swore
            the knight, still kneeling. &lsquo;Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant is
            destroyed.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where is the villain?&rsquo; &lsquo;In the mauve salon. Go, brave heart, and save
            me from despair.&lsquo; &rsquo;I obey, and return victorious or dead!&lsquo; With these thrilling words he
            rushed away, and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when he
            received&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him,&rdquo;
            said Ned. &ldquo;Instantly Sir What&lsquo;s-his-name recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the
            window, and turned to join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow; found the door locked, tore up
            the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when the ladder broke, and he went head first into the
            moat, sixty feet below. Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came to a little door
            guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads together till they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by
            a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone steps
            covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into
            hysterics, Miss March. At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and
            chilled his blood&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand,&rdquo; went on
            Meg. &ldquo;It beckoned, gliding noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb.
            Shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and the
            ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him, showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white
            veil. They reached a curtained door, behind which sounded lovely music; he sprang forward to enter, but the
            specter plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Snuffbox,&rdquo; said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the audience. &ldquo;
            &lsquo;Thankee,&rsquo; said the knight politely, as he took a pinch and sneezed seven times so violently
            that his head fell off. &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; laughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at
            the princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her victim and put him in a large tin
            box, where there were eleven other knights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all rose
            and began to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dance a hornpipe,&rdquo;<u><sup>ca</sup></u> cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, &ldquo;and, as they
            danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war<u><sup>cb</sup></u> in full sail. &lsquo;Up with the
            jib, reef the tops&rsquo;l halliards, helm hard alee, and man the guns!&lsquo; roared the captain, as a
            Portuguese pirate hove<u><sup>cc</sup></u> in sight, with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast.
            &rsquo;Go in and win, my hearties!&lsquo; says the captain, and a tremendous fight began. Of course the
            British beat, they always do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, they don&lsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Jo, aside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap<u><sup>cd</sup></u> over the schooner, whose
            decks were piled with dead and whose lee scuppers ran blood, for the order had been &lsquo;Cutlasses, and
            die hard!&rsquo; &lsquo;Bosun&rsquo;s mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if
            he doesn&rsquo;t confess his sins double</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>quick,&rsquo; said the British captain. The Portuguese held his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank,
            while the jolly tars cheered like mad. But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war, scuttled her,
            and down she went, with all sail set, &lsquo;To the bottom of the sea, sea, sea,&rsquo;
            where&mdash;&rdquo;<u><sup>6</sup></u></p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh gracious! what shall I say?&rdquo; cried Sallie, as Fred ended his rig-marole, in which he had
            jumbled together pell-mell nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books. &ldquo;Well, they
            went to the bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on finding the box of headless
            knights, and kindly pickled them in brine, hoping to discover the mystery about them, for, being a woman,
            she was curious. By-and-by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you this box of
            pearls if you can take it up,&rsquo; for she wanted to restore the poor things to life, and couldn&rsquo;t
            raise the heavy load herself. So the diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to find no
            pearls. He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found by a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Little goosegirl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,&rdquo; said Amy, when Sallie&rsquo;s
            invention gave out. &ldquo;The little girl was sorry for them, and asked an old woman what she should do to
            help them. &lsquo;Your geese will tell you, they know everything,&rsquo; said the old woman.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So she asked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost, and all the geese opened their
            hundred mouths and screamed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cabbages!&rsquo;&rdquo; continued Laurie promptly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Just the thing,&rsquo; said
            the girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on, the knights revived at once,
            thanked her, and went on their way rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other
            heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it. The knight in whom I&rsquo;m interested
            went back to find the pretty face, and learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone to
            be married, but one. He was in a great state of mind at that; and mounting the colt, who stood by him
            through thick and thin, rushed to the castle to see which was left. Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen
            of his affections picking flowers in her garden. &lsquo;Will you give me a rose?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;You
            must come and get it. I can&rsquo;t come to you, it isn&rsquo;t proper,&rsquo; said she, as sweet as honey.
            He tried to climb over the hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher; then he tried to push through,
            but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he patiently broke twig after twig till he had
            made a little hole through which he peeped, saying imploringly, &lsquo;Let me in! Let me in!&rsquo; But the
            pretty princess did not seem to understand, for she picked her roses quietly, and left him to fight his way
            in. Whether he did or not, Frank will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;m not playing, I never do,&rdquo; said Frank, dismayed at the sentimental
            predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple. Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was
            asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he?&rdquo; asked Mr. Brooke, still watching
            the river, and playing with the wild. rose in his buttonhole.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate after a while,&rdquo; said Laurie, smiling
            to himself, as he threw acorns at his tutor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What a piece of nonsense we have made! With practice we might do something quite clever. Do you know
            Truth?&rdquo; asked Sallie, after they had laughed over their story.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Meg soberly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The game, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn, and the person who draws at the
            number has to answer truly any questions put by the rest. It&rsquo;s great fun.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try it,&rdquo; said Jo, who liked new experiments.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Miss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo, and Laurie piled and drew, and the lot
            fell to Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Who are your heroes?&rdquo; asked Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Grandfather and Napoleon.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Which lady here do you think prettiest?&rdquo; said Sallie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Margaret.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Which do you like best?&rdquo; from Fred.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo, of course.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What silly questions you ask!&rdquo; And Jo gave a disdainful shrug as the rest laughed at
            Laurie&rsquo;s matter-of-fact tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Try again; Truth isn&rsquo;t a bad game,&rdquo; said Fred.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very good one for you,&rdquo; retorted Jo in a low voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her turn came next.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What is your greatest fault?&rdquo; asked Fred, by way of testing in her the virtue he lacked himself.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A quick temper.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What do you most wish for?&rdquo; said Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A pair of boot lacings,&rdquo; returned Jo, guessing and defeating his purpose.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a true answer; you must say what you really do want most.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Genius; don&rsquo;t you wish you could give it to me, Laurie?&rdquo; And she slyly smiled in his
            disappointed face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What virtues do you most admire in a man?&rdquo; asked Sallie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Courage and honesty.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now my turn,&rdquo; said Fred, as his hand came last.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give it to him,&rdquo; whispered Laurie to Jo, who nodded and asked at once&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you cheat at croquet?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, a little bit.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good! Didn&rsquo;t you take your story out of The Sea-Lion? &rdquo; said Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Rather.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the English nation perfect in every respect?&rdquo; asked Sallie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I should be ashamed of myself if I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a true John Bull.<u><sup>ce</sup></u> Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have a chance without
            waiting to draw. I&rsquo;ll harrow up your feelings first by asking if you don&rsquo;t think you are
            something of a flirt,&rdquo; said Laurie, as Jo nodded to Fred as a sign that peace was declared.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You impertinent boy! Of course I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; exclaimed Sallie, with an air that proved the
            contrary.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What do you hate most?&rdquo; asked Fred.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Spiders and rice pudding.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What do you like best?&rdquo; asked Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dancing and French gloves.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I think Truth is a very silly play; let&rsquo;s have a sensible game of Authors to refresh our
            minds,&rdquo; proposed Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ned, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it went on, the three elders sat apart, talking.
            Miss Kate took out her sketch again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass with a
            book, which he did not read.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How beautifully you do it! I wish I could draw,&rdquo; said Meg, with mingled admiration and regret in
            her voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you learn? I should think you had taste and talent for it,&rdquo; replied Miss Kate
            graciously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy. So did mine, but I proved to her that I had talent
            by taking a few lessons privately, and then she was quite willing I should go on. Can&rsquo;t you do the
            same with your governess?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I have none.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I forgot young ladies in America go to school more than with us. Very fine schools they are, too, Papa
            says. You go to a private one, I suppose?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go at all. I am a governess
            myself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said Miss Kate; but she might as well have said, &ldquo;Dear me, how
            dreadful!&rdquo; for her tone implied it, and something in her face made Meg color, and wish she had not
            been so frank.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, &ldquo;Young ladies in America love independence as much as their
            ancestors did, and are admired and respected for supporting themselves.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course it&rsquo;s very nice and proper in them to do so. We have many most respectable and
            worthy young women who do the same and are employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters of
            gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know,&rdquo; said Miss Kate in a patronizing tone
            that hurt Meg&rsquo;s pride, and made her work seem not only more distasteful, but degrading.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Did the German song suit, Miss March?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking an awkward pause.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! It was very sweet, and I&rsquo;m much obliged to whoever translated it for me.&rdquo; And
            Meg&rsquo;s downcast face brightened as she spoke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you read German?&rdquo; asked Miss Kate with a look of surprise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not very well. My father, who taught me, is away, and I don&rsquo;t get on very fast alone, for
            I&rsquo;ve no one to correct my pronunciation.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Try a little now; here is Schiller&rsquo;s Mary Stuart<u><sup>cf</sup></u> and a tutor who loves to
            teach.&rdquo; And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap with an inviting smile.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard I&rsquo;m afraid to try,&rdquo; said Meg, grateful, but bashful in the presence of
            the accomplished young lady beside her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read a bit to encourage you.&rdquo; And Miss Kate read one of the most beautiful passages
            in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless manner. Mr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the
            book to Meg, who said innocently, &ldquo;I thought it was poetry.&rdquo; &ldquo;Some of it is. Try this
            passage.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s mouth as he opened at poor Mary&rsquo;s lament.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor used to point with, read slowly and
            timidly, unconsciously making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice. Down the
            page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read
            as if alone, giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen. If she had seen the brown
            eyes then, she would have stopped short; but she never looked up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Very well indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her many mistakes, and looking
            as if he did indeed &ldquo;love to teach.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little tableau before her, shut her sketchbook,
            saying with condescension, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader. I advise
            you to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers. I must look after Grace, she is
            romping.&rdquo; And Miss Kate strolled away, adding to herself with a shrug, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come to
            chaperone a governess, though she is young and pretty. What odd people these Yankees are; I&rsquo;m afraid
            Laurie will be quite spoiled among them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at gov ernesses and don&rsquo;t treat them as
            we do,&rdquo; said Meg, looking after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to my sorrow. There&rsquo;s no place like
            America for us workers, Miss Margaret.&rdquo; And Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful that Meg was
            ashamed to lament her hard lot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I live in it then. I don&rsquo;t like my work, but I get a good deal of satisfaction
            out of it after all, so I won&rsquo;t complain; I only wish I liked teaching as you do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil. I shall be very sorry to lose him next year,&rdquo;
            said Mr. Brooke, busily punching holes in the turf. &ldquo;Going to college, I suppose?&rdquo; Meg&rsquo;s
            lips asked that question, but her eyes added, &ldquo;And what becomes of you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s
            high time he went, for he is ready; and as soon as he is off, I shall turn soldier. I am needed.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I am glad of that!&rdquo; exclaimed Meg. &ldquo;I should think every young man would want to go,
            though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay at home,&rdquo; she added sorrowfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or die,&rdquo; said Mr. Brooke rather
            bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all be very sorry to have any harm
            happen to you,&rdquo; said Meg heartily.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you, that sounds pleasant,&rdquo; began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful again; but before he could
            finish his speech, Ned, mounted on the old horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before
            the young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love to ride?&rdquo; asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting after a race round the
            field with the others, led by Ned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I dote upon it; my sister Meg used to ride when Papa was rich, but we don&rsquo;t keep any horses now,
            except Ellen Tree,&rdquo; added Amy, laughing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tell me about Ellen Tree. Is it a donkey?&rdquo; asked Grace curiously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but we&rsquo;ve only got an old sidesaddle and no
            horse. Out in our garden is an apple tree that has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some
            reins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree whenever we like.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How funny!&rdquo; laughed Grace. &ldquo;I have a pony at home, and ride nearly every day in the park
            with Fred and Kate; it&rsquo;s very nice, for my friends go too, and the Row<u><sup>cg</sup></u> is full of
            ladies and gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dear, how charming! I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I&rsquo;d rather go to Rome than the
            Row,&rdquo; said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what the Row was and wouldn&rsquo;t have asked for the
            world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were saying, and pushed his crutch away from him
            with an impatient gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical gymnastics. Beth,
            who was collecting the scattered Author cards, looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way,
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are tired; can I do anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Talk to me, please; it&rsquo;s dull, sitting by myself,&rdquo; answered Frank, who had evidently been
            used to being made much of at home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If he had asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed a more impossible task to bashful
            Beth; but there was no place to run to, no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at
            her that she bravely resolved to try.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What do you like to talk about?&rdquo; she asked, fumbling over the cards and dropping half as she
            tried to tie them up.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,&rdquo; said Frank, who had not yet learned
            to suit his amusements to his strength.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My heart! What shall I do? I don&rsquo;t know anything about them,&rdquo; thought Beth, and forgetting
            the boy&rsquo;s misfortune in her flurry, she said, hoping to make him talk, &ldquo;I never saw any hunting,
            but I suppose you know all about it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I did once; but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a confounded five-barred gate, so there
            are no more horses and hounds for me,&rdquo; said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her
            innocent blunder.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes,&rdquo; she said, turning to the prairies for help
            and feeling glad that she had read one of the boys&rsquo; books in which Jo delighted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness to amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and
            was quite unconscious of her sisters&rsquo; surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking
            away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had begged protection.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bless her heart! She pities him, so she is good to him,&rdquo; said Jo, beaming at her from the
            croquet ground.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I always said she was a little saint,&rdquo; added Meg, as if there could be no further doubt of it.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long,&rdquo; said Grace to Amy, as they sat
            discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn cups.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes to be,&rdquo; said Amy, well pleased at
            Beth&rsquo;s success. She meant &ldquo;fascinating,&rdquo; but as Grace didn&rsquo;t know the exact meaning
            of either word, &ldquo;fastidious&rdquo; sounded well and made a good impression.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet finished the afternoon. At sunset the
            tent was struck, hampers packed, wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the
            river, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental, warbled a serenade with the pensive
            refrain&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alone, alone, ah! woe, alone,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and at the lines&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We each are young, we each have a heart,</p>
        <p>Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>he looked at Meg with such a lackadaisical expression that she laughed outright and spoiled his song.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How can you be so cruel to me?&rdquo; he whispered, under cover of a lively chorus.
            &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve kept close to that starched-up English-woman all day, and now you snub me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; replied Meg,
            passing over the first part of his reproach, for it was quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the
            Moffat party and the talk after it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ned was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her rather pettishly, &ldquo;There
            isn&rsquo;t a bit of flirt in that girl, is there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not a particle, but she&rsquo;s a
            dear,&rdquo; returned Sallie, defending her friend even while confessing her shortcomings.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a stricken deer anyway,&rdquo; said Ned, trying to be witty, and succeeding as well as
            very young gentlemen usually do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with cordial good nights and good-bys, for the
            Vaughns were going to Canada. As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked after them,
            saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice, &ldquo;In spite of their demonstrative manners, American
            girls are very nice when one knows them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; said Mr. Brooke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>13</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Castles in the Air</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock, one warm September afternoon, wondering what his
            neighbors were about, but too lazy to go and find out. He was in one of his moods, for the day had been both
            unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could live it over again. The hot weather made him
            indolent, and he had shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s patience to the utmost, displeased his
            grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by
            mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman about
            some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the
            world in general, till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up into the
            green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining
            himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a
            flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches coming out, as if bound on some
            expedition.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What in the world are those girls about now?&rdquo; thought Laurie, opening his sleepy eyes to take a
            good look, for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors. Each wore a large,
            flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried a long staff. Meg had a cushion, Jo a
            book, Beth a basket, and Amy a portfolio. All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little back
            gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s cool,&rdquo; said Laurie to himself, &ldquo;to have a picnic and never ask me! They
            can&rsquo;t be going in the boat, for they haven&rsquo;t got the key. Perhaps they forgot it; I&rsquo;ll
            take it to them, and see what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find one; then there was a hunt for the key,
            which was at last discovered in his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped the
            fence and ran after them. Taking the shortest way to the boathouse, he waited for them to appear; but no one
            came, and he went up the hill to take an observation. A grove of pines covered one part of it, and from the
            heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the
            crickets.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a landscape!&rdquo; thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and looking wide-awake
            and good-natured already.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was rather a pretty little picture, for the sisters sat together in the shady nook, with sun and shadow
            flickering over them, the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the little
            wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends. Meg sat upon her
            cushion, sewing daintily with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress
            among the green. Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by, for she made pretty
            things of them. Amy was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud. A shadow passed
            over the boy&rsquo;s face as he watched them, feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited, yet
            lingering because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless
            spirit. He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw
            him suddenly and skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the wistful face behind the
            birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;May I come in, please? Or shall I be a bother?&rdquo; he asked, advancing slowly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once, &ldquo;Of course you may. We
            should have asked you before, only we thought you wouldn&rsquo;t care for such a girl&rsquo;s game as
            this.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I always like your games; but if Meg doesn&rsquo;t want me, I&rsquo;ll go away.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no objection, if you do something; it&rsquo;s against the rules to be idle here,&rdquo;
            replied Meg gravely but graciously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Much obliged. I&rsquo;ll do anything if you&rsquo;ll let me stop a bit, for it&rsquo;s as dull as the
            Desert of Sahara down there. Shall I sew, read, cone, draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears,
            I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo; And Laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Finish this story while I set my heel,&rdquo; said Jo, handing him the book.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes&lsquo;m&rdquo; was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his gratitude for the
            favor of an admission into the &ldquo;Busy Bee Society.&rdquo; The story was not a long one, and when it was
            finished, he ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Please, ma&lsquo;am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new
            one?&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you tell him?&rdquo; asked Meg of her sisters. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll laugh,&rdquo;
            said Amy warningly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; said Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;ll like it,&rdquo; added Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course I shall! I give you my word I won&rsquo;t laugh. Tell away, Jo, and don&rsquo;t be
            afraid.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The idea of being afraid of you! Well, you see we used to play Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress, and we have
            been going on with it in earnest, all winter and summer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Laurie, nodding wisely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo; demanded Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Spirits.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I did. I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away, and he was rather dismal. He did
            like it, so don&rsquo;t scold, Jo,&rdquo; said Beth meekly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep a secret. Never
            mind, it saves trouble now.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Go on, please,&rdquo; said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work, looking a trifle displeased.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t she tell you about this new plan of ours? Well, we have tried not to waste our
            holiday, but each has had a task and worked at it with a will. The vacation is nearly over, the stints are
            all done, and we are ever so glad that we didn&rsquo;t dawdle.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I should think so.&rdquo; And Laurie thought regretfully of his own idle days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring our work here and have nice
            times. For the fun of it we bring our things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill,
            and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago. We call this hill the Delectable
            Mountain,<u><sup>ch</sup></u> for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live
            sometime.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the wood one could look across the wide,
            blue river, the meadows on the other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills that
            rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the heavens glowed with the splendor&lsquo; of an autumn sunset.
            Gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks
            that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How beautiful that is!&rdquo; said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but always splendid,&rdquo;
            replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime&mdash;the real country, she means, with pigs
            and chickens and haymaking. It would be nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we
            could ever go to it,&rdquo; said Beth musingly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go, by-and-by, when we are good
            enough,&rdquo; answered Meg with her sweet voice. &ldquo;It seems so long to wait, so hard to do. I want to
            fly away at once, as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,&rdquo; said Jo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the
            one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and maybe never get in after all.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have me for company, if that&rsquo;s any comfort. I shall have to do a deal of traveling
            before I come in sight of your Celestial City. If I arrive late, you&rsquo;ll say a good word for me,
            won&rsquo;t you, Beth?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Something in the boy&rsquo;s face troubled his little friend, but she said cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on
            the changing clouds, &ldquo;If people really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will
            get in, for I don&rsquo;t believe there are any locks on that door or any guards at the gate. I always
            imagine it is as it is in the picture, where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor
            Christian as he comes up from the river.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true, and we could
            live in them?&rdquo; said Jo, after a little pause.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I&rsquo;d have,&rdquo; said Laurie,
            lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to take your favorite one. What is it?&rdquo; asked Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If I tell mine, will you tell yours?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, if the girls will too.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We will. Now, Laurie.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;After I&rsquo;d seen as much of the world as I want to, I&rsquo;d like to settle in Germany and have
            just as much music as I choose. I&rsquo;m to be a famous musician myself, and all creation is to rush to
            hear me; and I&rsquo;m never to be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself and live for what
            I like. That&rsquo;s my favorite castle. What&rsquo;s yours, Meg?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a brake<u><sup>ci</sup></u> before her face,
            as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she said slowly, &ldquo;I should like a lovely house, full of all
            sorts of luxurious things&mdash;nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture, pleasant people, and heaps of
            money. I am to be mistress of it, and manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work a
            bit. How I should enjoy it! For I wouldn&rsquo;t be idle, but do good, and make everyone love me
            dearly.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you have a master for your castle in the air?&rdquo; asked Laurie slyly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;pleasant people,&rsquo; you know.&rdquo; And Meg carefully tied up her shoe as she
            spoke, so that no one saw her face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say you&rsquo;d have a splendid, wise, good husband and some angelic little
            children? You know your castle wouldn&rsquo;t be perfect without,&rdquo; said blunt Jo, who had no tender
            fancies yet, and rather scorned romance, except in books.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours,&rdquo; answered Meg petulantly.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I, though? I&rsquo;d have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms piled with books, and
            I&rsquo;d write out of a magic inkstand, so that my works should be as famous as Laurie&rsquo;s music. I
            want to do something splendid before I go into my castle&mdash;something heroic or wonderful that
            won&rsquo;t be forgotten after I&rsquo;m dead. I don&rsquo;t know what, but I&rsquo;m on the watch for it,
            and mean to astonish you all some day. I think I shall write books, and get rich and famous: that would suit
            me, so that is my favorite dream.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help take care of the family,&rdquo; said
            Beth contentedly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish for anything else?&rdquo; asked Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only wish we may all keep well and be
            together, nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist, and go to Rome, and do fine pictures,
            and be the best artist in the whole world&rdquo; was Amy&rsquo;s modest desire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re an ambitious set, aren&rsquo;t we? Every one of us, but Beth, wants to be rich and famous,
            and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes,&rdquo; said Laurie,
            chewing grass like a meditative calf.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the door remains to be
            seen,&rdquo; observed Jo mysteriously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the key to mine, but I&rsquo;m not allowed to try it. Hang college!&rdquo; muttered
            Laurie with an impatient sigh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; And Amy waved her pencil.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any,&rdquo; said Meg forlornly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, you have,&rdquo; said Laurie at once.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;In your face.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, that&rsquo;s of no use.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Wait and see if it doesn&rsquo;t bring you something worth having,&rdquo; replied the boy, laughing at
            the thought of a charming little secret which he fancied he knew.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and looked across the river with the same expectant
            expression which Mr. Brooke had worn when he told the story of the knight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If we are all alive ten years hence, let&rsquo;s meet, and see how many of us have got our wishes, or
            how much nearer we are then than now,&rdquo; said Jo, always ready with a plan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bless me! How old I shall be&mdash;twenty-seven!&rdquo; exclaimed Meg, who felt grown up already,
            having just reached seventeen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy twenty-two. What a venerable
            party!&rdquo; said Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time, but I&rsquo;m such a lazy dog,
            I&rsquo;m afraid I shall &lsquo;dawdle,&rsquo; Jo.&rdquo; &ldquo;You need a motive, Mother says; and when
            you get it, she is sure you&rsquo;ll work splendidly.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is she? By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!&rdquo; cried Laurie, sitting up with sudden
            energy. &ldquo;I ought to be satisfied to please Grandfather, and I do try, but it&rsquo;s working against
            the grain, you see, and comes hard. He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and I&rsquo;d rather be
            shot. I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring, and I don&rsquo;t care
            how soon they go to the bottom when I own them. Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if I give him
            four years he ought to let me off from the business; but he&rsquo;s set, and I&rsquo;ve got to do just as he
            did, unless I break away and please myself, as my father did. If there was anyone left to stay with the old
            gentleman, I&rsquo;d do it tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into execution on the slightest provocation, for
            he was growing up very fast and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man&rsquo;s hatred of
            subjection, a young man&rsquo;s restless longing to try the world for himself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home again till you have tried your own
            way,&rdquo; said Jo, whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy
            was excited by what she called &ldquo;Teddy&rsquo;s wrongs.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right, Jo; you mustn&rsquo;t talk in that way, and Laurie mustn&rsquo;t take your bad
            advice. You should do just what your grandfather wishes, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Meg in her most maternal
            tone. &ldquo;Do your best at college, and when he sees that you try to please him, I&rsquo;m sure he
            won&rsquo;t be hard or unjust to you. As you say, there is no one else to stay with and love him, and
            you&rsquo;d never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission. Don&rsquo;t be dismal or fret,
            but do your duty and you&rsquo;ll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being respected and
            loved.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What do you know about him?&rdquo; asked Laurie, grateful for the good advice, but objecting to the
            lecture, and glad to turn the conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Only what your grandpa told us about him&mdash;how he took good care of his own mother till she died,
            and wouldn&rsquo;t go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he wouldn&rsquo;t leave her; and how he
            provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone, but is just as generous and
            patient and good as he can be.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So he is, dear old fellow!&rdquo; said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused, looking flushed and earnest
            with her story. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like Grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know, and to
            tell all his goodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn&rsquo;t understand why your
            mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way. He
            thought she was just perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about you all in flaming
            style. If ever I do get my wish, you see what I&rsquo;ll do for Brooke.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out,&rdquo; said Meg sharply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How do you know I do, miss?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can always tell by his face when he goes away. If you have been good, he looks satisfied and walks
            briskly; if you have plagued him, he&rsquo;s sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his
            work better.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I like that! So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in Brooke&rsquo;s face, do you? I
            see him bow and smile as he passes your window, but I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d got up a
            telegraph.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t be angry, and oh, don&rsquo;t tell him I said anything! It was only to
            show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here is said in confidence, you know,&rdquo; cried Meg,
            much alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her careless speech.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tell tales,&rdquo; replied Laurie, with his &ldquo;high and mighty&rdquo; air, as Jo
            called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. &ldquo;Only if Brooke is going to be a thermometer,
            I must mind and have fair weather for him to report.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be offended. I didn&rsquo;t mean to preach or tell tales or be silly. I only
            thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you&rsquo;d be sorry for by-and-by. You are so kind to us,
            we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.&rdquo; And Meg
            offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand, and said frankly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the
            one to be forgiven. I&rsquo;m cross and have been out of sorts all day. I like to have you tell me my faults
            and be sisterly, so don&rsquo;t mind if I am grumpy sometimes. I thank you all the same.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable as possible&mdash;wound cotton for
            Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself
            a fit person to belong to the &ldquo;Busy Bee Society.&rdquo; In the midst of an animated discussion on the
            domestic habits of turtles (one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint
            sound of a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea &ldquo;to draw,&rdquo;<u><sup>cj</sup></u> and they
            would just have time to get home to supper.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;May I come again?&rdquo; asked Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer are told to do,&rdquo; said Meg,
            smiling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then you may come, and I&rsquo;ll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do. There&rsquo;s a demand for
            socks just now,&rdquo; added Jo, waving hers like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie, standing in the shadow of the curtain,
            listened to the little David,<u><sup>ck</sup></u> whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and
            watched the old man, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he
            had loved so much. Remembering the conversation of the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve
            to make the sacrifice cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let my castle go, and stay with the dear old gentleman
            while he needs me, for I am all he has.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>14</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Secrets</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow chilly, and the afternoons were short. For
            two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa, writing busily,
            with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her, while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams
            overhead, accompanied by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of his whiskers.
            Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the last page was filled, when she signed her name with a
            flourish and threw down her pen, exclaiming&mdash;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There, I&rsquo;ve done my best! If this won&rsquo;t suit I shall have to wait till I can do
            better.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through, making dashes here and there, and putting
            in many exclamation points, which looked like little balloons; then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon,
            and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression, which plainly showed how earnest her work
            had been. Jo&rsquo;s desk up here was an old tin kitchen<u><sup>cl</sup></u> which hung against the wall. In
            it she kept her papers and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being likewise of a literary
            turn, was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves.
            From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, and putting both in her pocket, crept quietly
            downstairs, leaving her friends to nibble her pens and taste her ink.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to the back entry window, got out upon
            the roof of a low porch, swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road. Once
            there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled away to town, looking very merry and
            mysterious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar, for on alighting,
            she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street; having found the
            place with some difficulty, she went into the doorway, looked up the dirty stairs, and after standing stock
            still a minute, suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came. This maneuver she
            repeated several times, to the great amusement of a black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a
            building opposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake, pulled her hat over her eyes,
            and walked up the stairs, looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a dentist&rsquo;s sign, among others, which adorned the entrance, and after staring a moment at the
            pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young
            gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway, saying with
            a smile and a shiver, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she&rsquo;ll need
            someone to help her home.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had
            just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but
            pleased, and passed him with a nod; but he followed, asking with an air of sympathy, &ldquo;Did you have a
            bad time?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not very.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You got through quickly.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, thank goodness!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why did you go alone?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the oddest fellow I ever saw. How many did you have out?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then began to laugh as if mightily amused at
            something.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at? You are up to some mischief, Jo,&rdquo; said Laurie, looking mystified.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So are you. What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Begging your pardon, ma&lsquo;am, it wasn&rsquo;t a billiard saloon, but a gymnasium, and I was taking
            a lesson in fencing.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes,<u><sup>cm</sup></u> and
            we&rsquo;ll make a fine thing of the fencing scene.&rdquo; Laurie burst out with a hearty boy&rsquo;s laugh,
            which made several passers-by smile in spite of themselves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you whether we play Hamlet or not; it&rsquo;s grand fun and will straighten you up
            capitally. But I don&rsquo;t believe that was your only reason for saying &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad&rsquo; in
            that decided way; was it, now?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you never go to such places. Do
            you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not often.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no harm, Jo. I have billiards at home, but it&rsquo;s no fun unless you have good players;
            so, as I&rsquo;m fond of it, I come sometimes and have a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other
            fellows.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh dear, I&rsquo;m so sorry, for you&rsquo;ll get to liking it better and better, and will waste time
            and money, and grow like those dreadful boys. I did hope you&rsquo;d stay respectable and be a satisfaction
            to your friends,&rdquo; said Jo, shaking her head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his
            respectability?&rdquo; asked Laurie, looking nettled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That depends upon how and where he takes it. I don&rsquo;t like Ned and his set, and wish you&rsquo;d
            keep out of it. Mother won&rsquo;t let us have him at our house, though he wants to come; and if you grow
            like him she won&rsquo;t be willing to have us frolic together as we do now.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; asked Laurie anxiously.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, she can&rsquo;t bear fashionable young men, and she&rsquo;d shut us all up in
            bandboxes<u><sup>cn</sup></u> rather than have us associate with them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, she needn&rsquo;t get out her bandboxes yet. I&rsquo;m not a fashionable party and don&rsquo;t
            mean to be, but I do like harmless larks now and then, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don&rsquo;t get wild, will you? Or there will be an end of
            all our good times.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a double-distilled saint.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear saints: just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and we&rsquo;ll never desert
            you. I don&rsquo;t know what I should do if you acted like Mr. King&rsquo;s son; he had plenty of money, but
            didn&rsquo;t know how to spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his father&rsquo;s
            name, I believe, and was altogether horrid.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m likely to do the same? Much obliged.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I don&lsquo;t&mdash;oh, dear, no!&mdash;but I hear people talking about money being such a
            temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor; I shouldn&rsquo;t worry then.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you worry about me, Jo?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A little, when you look moody or discontented, as you sometimes do; for you&rsquo;ve got such a strong
            will, if you once get started wrong, I&rsquo;m afraid it would be hard to stop you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she had held her tongue, for his eyes
            looked angry, though his lips still smiled as if at her warnings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?&rdquo; he asked presently.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course not. Why?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Because if you are, I&rsquo;ll take a bus; if you are not, I&rsquo;d like to walk with you and tell
            you something very interesting.&rdquo; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t preach any more, and I&rsquo;d like to hear the
            news immensely.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Very well, then, come on. It&rsquo;s a secret, and if I tell you, you must tell me yours.&rdquo;
            &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any,&rdquo; began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that she had.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You know you have&mdash;you can&rsquo;t hide anything, so up and fess, or I won&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo;
            cried Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is your secret a nice one?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it! All about people you know, and such fun! You ought to hear it, and I&rsquo;ve been
            aching to tell it this long time. Come, you begin.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not say anything about it at home, will you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t tease me in private?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I never tease.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, you do. You get everything you want out of people. I don&rsquo;t know how you do it, but you are
            a born wheedler.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you. Fire away.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve left two stories with a newspaperman, and he&rsquo;s to give his answer next
            week,&rdquo; whispered Jo, in her confidant&rsquo;s ear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!&rdquo; cried Laurie, throwing up his hat and
            catching it again, to the great delight of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children,
            for they were out of the city now.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hush! It won&rsquo;t come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn&rsquo;t rest till I had tried, and I
            said nothing about it because I didn&rsquo;t want anyone else to be disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t fail. Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that
            is published every day. Won&rsquo;t it be fun to see them in print, and shan&rsquo;t we feel proud of our
            authoress?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in, and a friend&rsquo;s praise is always
            sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your secret? Play fair, Teddy, or I&rsquo;ll never believe you again,&rdquo; she said,
            trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn&rsquo;t promise not to, so I will, for I never feel
            easy in my mind till I&rsquo;ve told you any plummy<u><sup>co</sup></u> bit of news I get. I know where
            Meg&rsquo;s glove is.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of
            mysterious intelligence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite enough for the present, as you&rsquo;ll agree when I tell you where it is.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tell, then.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo&rsquo;s ear, which produced a comical change. She stood and
            stared at him for a minute, looking both surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply,
            &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Saw it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Pocket.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;All this time?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t that romantic?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s horrid.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s ridiculous, it won&rsquo;t be allowed. My patience! What would Meg
            say?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are not to tell anyone. Mind that.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t promise.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That was understood, and I trusted you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t for the present, anyway, but I&rsquo;m disgusted, and wish you hadn&rsquo;t told
            me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be pleased.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see anyone try it,&rdquo; cried Jo fiercely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So should I!&rdquo; And Laurie chuckled at the idea.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that,&rdquo;
            said Jo rather ungratefully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Race down this hill with me, and you&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; suggested Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before her, and finding the temptation irresistible,
            Jo darted away, soon leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran. Laurie reached the
            goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his treatment, for his Atalanta<u><sup>cp</sup></u>
            came panting up with flying hair, bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this splendid air, and not lose my breath. It was
            capital, but see what a guy it&rsquo;s made me. Go, pick up my things, like a cherub as you are,&rdquo; said
            Jo, dropping down under a maple tree, which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled up her braids, hoping no one would
            pass by till she was tidy again. But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking particularly
            ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been making calls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What in the world are you doing here?&rdquo; she asked, regarding her disheveled sister with well-bred
            surprise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Getting leaves,&rdquo; meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had just swept up.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And hairpins,&rdquo; added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;They grow on this
            road, Meg; so do combs and brown straw hats.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You have been running, Jo. How could you? When will you stop such romping ways?&rdquo; said Meg
            reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Never till I&rsquo;m stiff and old and have to use a crutch. Don&rsquo;t try to make me grow up before
            my time, Meg: it&rsquo;s hard enough to have you change all of a sudden; let me be a little girl as long as
            I can.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips, for lately she had felt that
            Margaret was fast getting to be a woman, and Laurie&rsquo;s secret made her dread the separation which must
            surely come sometime and now seemed very near. He saw the trouble in her face and drew Meg&rsquo;s attention
            from it by asking quickly, &ldquo;Where have you been calling, all so fine?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;At the Gardiners&lsquo;, and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle Moffat&rsquo;s wedding. It was
            very splendid, and they have gone to spend the winter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must
            be!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you envy her, Meg?&rdquo; said Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it!&rdquo; muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Meg, looking surprised.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a poor man,&rdquo; said Jo,
            frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to mind what she said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall never &lsquo;go and marry&rsquo; anyone,&rdquo; observed Meg, walking on with great dignity
            while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping stones, and &ldquo;behaving like children,&rdquo;
            as Meg said to herself, though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress
            on.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite bewildered. She rushed to the door when
            the postman rang, was rude to Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with a woe-begone face,
            occasionally jumping up to shake and then to kiss her in a very mysterious manner; Laurie and she were
            always making signs to one another, and talking about &ldquo;Spread Eagles&rdquo; till the girls declared
            they had both lost their wits. On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing
            at her window, was scandalized by the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally capturing
            her in Amy&rsquo;s bower. What went on there, Meg could not see, but shrieks of laughter were heard,
            followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What shall we do with that girl? She never will behave like a young lady,&rdquo; sighed Meg, as she
            watched the race with a disapproving face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hope she won&rsquo;t; she is so funny and dear as she is,&rdquo; said Beth, who had never betrayed
            that she was a little hurt at Jo&rsquo;s having secrets with anyone but her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very trying, but we never can make her commy la fo,&rdquo; added Amy, who sat making some
            new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a very becoming way&mdash;two agreeable things which made
            her feel unusually elegant and ladylike.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected to read.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Have you anything interesting there?&rdquo; asked Meg with condescension.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nothing but a story; won&rsquo;t amount to much, I guess,&rdquo; returned Jo, carefully keeping the
            name of the paper out of sight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better read it aloud; that will amuse us and keep you out of mischief,&rdquo; said Amy in
            her most grown-up tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name?&rdquo; asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind the sheet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The Rival Painters.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That sounds well; read it,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With a loud &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast. The girls listened with
            interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I like that about the splendid picture&rdquo; was Amy&rsquo;s approving remark, as Jo paused.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I prefer the lovering part. Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite names, isn&rsquo;t that
            queer?&rdquo; said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the &ldquo;lovering part&rdquo; was tragical.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Who wrote it?&rdquo; asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo&rsquo;s face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed countenance, and with a funny mixture
            of solemnity and excitement replied in a loud voice, &ldquo;Your sister.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; cried Meg, dropping her work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good,&rdquo; said Amy critically.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I knew it! I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!&rdquo; And Beth ran to hug her sister and exult over
            this splendid success.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! How Meg wouldn&rsquo;t believe it till she saw the words,
            &ldquo;Miss Josephine March,&rdquo; actually printed in the paper; how graciously Amy criticized the
            artistic parts of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t be carried
            out, as the hero and heroine were dead; how Beth got excited, and skipped and sang with joy; how Hannah came
            in to exclaim &ldquo;Sakes alive, well I never!&rdquo; in great astonishment at &ldquo;that Jo&rsquo;s
            doin&lsquo;s&rdquo;; how proud Mrs. March was when she knew it; how Jo laughed, with tears in her eyes, as
            she declared she might as well</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>be a peacock and done with it; and how the &ldquo;Spread Eagle&rdquo; might be said to flap his wings
            triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper passed from hand to hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tell us all about it.&rdquo; &ldquo;When did it come?&rdquo; &ldquo;How much did you get for
            it?&rdquo; &ldquo;What will Father say?&rdquo; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Laurie laugh?&rdquo; cried the family, all
            in one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish, affectionate people made a jubilee of every
            little household joy.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Stop jabbering, girls, and I&rsquo;ll tell you everything,&rdquo; said Jo, wondering if Miss Burney
            felt any grander over her Evelina<u><sup>cq</sup></u> than she did over her &ldquo;Rival
            Painters.&rdquo;<u><sup>cr</sup></u> Having told how she disposed of her tales, Jo added, &ldquo;And when I
            went to get my answer, the man said he liked them both, but didn&rsquo;t pay beginners, only let them print
            in his paper, and noticed the stories. It was good practice, he said, and when the beginners improved,
            anyone would pay. So I let him have the two stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me
            with it and insisted on seeing it, so I let him; and he said it was good, and I shall write more, and
            he&rsquo;s going to get the next paid for, and I am so happy, for in time I may be able to support myself
            and help the girls.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo&rsquo;s breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper, she bedewed her little story with a few
            natural tears; for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her
            heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>15</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A Telegram</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,&rdquo; said Margaret, standing at the window one
            dull afternoon, looking out at the frostbitten garden.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason I was born in it,&rdquo; observed Jo pensively, quite unconscious of the blot
            on her nose.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a delightful month,&rdquo; said Beth,
            who took a hopeful view of everything, even November.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family,&rdquo; said Meg, who was out of
            sorts. &ldquo;We go grubbing along day after day, without a bit of change, and very little fun. We might as
            well be in a treadmill.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My patience, how blue we are!&rdquo; cried Jo. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much wonder, poor dear, for you
            see other girls having splendid times, while you grind, grind, year in and year out. Oh, don&rsquo;t I wish
            I could manage things for you as I do for my heroines! You&rsquo;re pretty enough and good enough already,
            so I&rsquo;d have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly; then you&rsquo;d dash out as an
            heiress, scorn everyone who has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady Something in a blaze of
            splendor and elegance.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t have fortunes left them in that style nowadays, men have to work and women to marry
            for money. It&rsquo;s a dreadfully unjust world,&rdquo; said Meg bitterly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all; just wait ten years, and see if we
            don&lsquo;t,&rdquo; said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud pies, as Hannah called her little clay models
            of birds, fruit, and faces.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait, and I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t much faith in ink and dirt, though I&rsquo;m
            grateful for your good intentions.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again; Jo groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a
            despondent attitude, but Amy spatted<u><sup>cs</sup></u> away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other
            window, said, smiling, &ldquo;Two pleasant things are going to happen right away: Marmee is coming down the
            street, and Laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, &ldquo;Any letter from Father, girls?&rdquo; and
            Laurie to say in his persuasive way, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t some of you come for a drive? I&rsquo;ve been
            working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle, and I&rsquo;m going to freshen my wits by a brisk
            turn. It&rsquo;s a dull day, but the air isn&rsquo;t bad, and I&rsquo;m going to take Brooke home, so it
            will be gay inside, if it isn&rsquo;t out. Come, Jo, you and Beth will go, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course we will.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Much obliged, but I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo; And Meg whisked out her workbasket, for she had agreed with
            her mother that it was best, for her at least, not to drive often with the young gentleman.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We three will be ready in a minute,&rdquo; cried Amy, running away to wash her hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?&rdquo; asked Laurie, leaning over Mrs. March&rsquo;s chair
            with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, thank you, except call at the office, if you&rsquo;ll be so kind, dear. It&rsquo;s our day for a
            letter, and the postman hasn&rsquo;t been. Father is as regular as the sun, but there&rsquo;s some delay on
            the way, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in with a letter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of them horrid telegraph things, mum,&rdquo; she said, handing it as if she was afraid
            it would explode and do some damage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At the word &ldquo;telegraph,&rdquo; Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it contained, and dropped
            back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart. Laurie dashed downstairs
            for water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, in a frightened voice&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MRS. MARCH:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Your husband is very ill. Come at once.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>HALE,</li>
        </ol>
        <p>BLANK HOSPITAL, WASHINGTON.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely the day darkened outside, and how
            suddenly the whole world seemed to change, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as if all the
            happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them. Mrs. March was herself again directly,
            read the message over, and stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never forgot,
            &ldquo;I shall go at once, but it may be too late. Oh, children, children, help me to bear it!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room, mingled with broken words of
            comfort, tender assurances of help, and hopeful whispers that died away in tears. Poor Hannah was the first
            to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example, for, with her, work was panacea
            for most afflictions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The Lord keep the dear man! I won&rsquo;t waste no time a-cryin&lsquo;, but git your things ready
            right away, mum,&rdquo; she said heartily, as she wiped her face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm
            shake of the hand with her own hard one, and went away to work like three women in one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right, there&rsquo;s no time for tears now. Be calm, girls, and let me think.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking pale but steady, and put away her grief
            to think and plan for them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Laurie?&rdquo; she asked presently, when she had collected her thoughts and decided on
            the first duties to be done.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here, ma&lsquo;am. Oh, let me do something!&rdquo; cried the boy, hurrying from the next room whither
            he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Send a telegram saying I will come at once. The next train goes early in the morning. I&rsquo;ll take
            that.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What else? The horses are ready; I can go anywhere, do anything,&rdquo; he said, looking ready to fly
            to the ends of the earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Leave a note at Aunt March&rsquo;s. Jo, give me that pen and paper.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew the table before her mother, well
            knowing that money for the long, sad journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do anything to
            add a little to the sum for her father.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now go, dear, but don&rsquo;t kill yourself driving at a desperate pace; there is no need of
            that.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March&rsquo;s warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes later Laurie tore by the window on his
            own fleet horse, riding as if for his life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can&rsquo;t come. On the way get these things.
            I&rsquo;ll put them down, they&rsquo;ll be needed and I must go prepared for nursing. Hospital stores are
            not always good. Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine: I&rsquo;m not too proud
            to beg for Father, he shall have the best of everything. Amy, tell Hannah to get down the black trunk; and,
            Meg, come and help me find my things, for I&rsquo;m half bewildered.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder the poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit
            quietly in her room for a little while, and let them work. Everyone scattered like leaves before a gust of
            wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for
            the invalid, and friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the mother&rsquo;s absence, which
            comforted her very much. There was nothing he didn&rsquo;t offer, from his own dressing gown to himself as
            escort. But that last was impossible. Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman&rsquo;s undertaking the
            long journey, yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it, for anxiety ill fits one for
            traveling. He saw the look, knit his heavy eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying
            he&rsquo;d be back directly. No one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran through the entry, with
            a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to hear of this, Miss March,&rdquo; he said, in the kind, quiet tone which
            sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit. &ldquo;I came to offer myself as escort to your mother. Mr.
            Laurence has commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her
            there.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg put out her hand, with a face so full
            of gratitude that Mr. Brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of
            time and comfort which he was about to make.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How kind you all are! Mother will accept, I&rsquo;m sure, and it will be such a relief to know that
            she has someone to take care of her. Thank you very, very much!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made
            her remember the cooling tea, and lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum,
            and a few lines repeating what she had often said before&mdash;that she had always told them it was absurd
            for March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come of it, and she hoped they would take
            her advice next time. Mrs. March put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on with her
            preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo would have understood if she had been there.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The short afternoon wore away; all the other errands were done, and Meg and her mother busy at some necessary
            needlework, while Beth and Amy got tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called a &ldquo;slap
            and a bang,&rdquo; but still Jo did not come. They began to get anxious, and Laurie went off to find her,
            for no one ever knew what freak Jo might take into her head. He missed her, however, and she came walking in
            with a very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun and fear, satisfaction and
            regret in it, which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying
            with a little choke in her voice, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my contribution toward making Father comfortable and
            bringing him home!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My dear, where did you get it? Twenty-five dollars! Jo, I hope you haven&rsquo;t done anything
            rash?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s mine honestly. I didn&rsquo;t beg, borrow, or steal it. I earned it, and I don&rsquo;t
            think you&rsquo;ll blame me, for I only sold what was my own.&rdquo; As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet,
            and a general outcry arose, for all her abundant hair was cut short.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your hair! Your beautiful hair!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, Jo, how could you? Your one beauty.&rdquo; &ldquo;My
            dear girl, there was no need of this.&rdquo; &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t look like my Jo any more, but I love
            her dearly for it!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo assumed an indifferent air, which did
            not deceive anyone a particle, and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it,
            &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t affect the fate of the nation, so don&rsquo;t wail, Beth. It will be good for my
            vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig. It will do my brains good to have that mop taken off; my head
            feels deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a curly crop, which will be boyish,
            becoming, and easy to keep in order. I&rsquo;m satisfied, so please take the money and let&rsquo;s have
            supper.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it, Jo. I am not quite satisfied, but I can&rsquo;t blame you, for I know how
            willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call it, to your love. But, my dear, it was not necessary, and
            I&rsquo;m afraid you will regret it one of these days,&rdquo; said Mrs. March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I won&lsquo;t!&rdquo; returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely
            condemned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What made you do it?&rdquo; asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her
            pretty hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I was wild to do something for Father,&rdquo; replied Jo, as they gathered about the table, for
            healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble. &ldquo;I hate to borrow as much as Mother does,
            and I knew Aunt March would croak; she always does, if you ask for a ninepence. Meg gave all her quarterly
            salary toward the rent, and I only got some clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some
            money, if I sold the nose off my face to get it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t feel wicked, my child: you had no winter things and got the simplest with your own
            hard earnings,&rdquo; said Mrs. March with a look that warmed Jo&rsquo;s heart.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went along I kept thinking what I
            could do, and feeling as if I&rsquo;d like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself. In a
            barber&rsquo;s window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail, not so thick as mine,
            was forty dollars. It came over me all of a sudden that I had one thing to make money out of, and without
            stopping to think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give for mine.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you dared to do it,&rdquo; said Beth in a tone of awe.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair. He rather stared at first,
            as if he wasn&rsquo;t used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair. He said he
            didn&rsquo;t care about mine, it wasn&rsquo;t the fashionable color, and he never paid much for it in the
            first place; the work put into it made it dear, and so on. It was getting late, and I was afraid if it
            wasn&rsquo;t done right away that I shouldn&rsquo;t have it done at all, and you know when I start to do a
            thing, I hate to give it up; so I begged him to take it, and told him why I was in such a hurry. It was
            silly, I dare say, but it changed his mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my topsy-turvy
            way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly, &lsquo;Take it, Thomas, and oblige the young lady; I&rsquo;d do
            as much for our Jimmy any day if I had a spire of hair worth selling.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Who was Jimmy?&rdquo; asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they went along.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Her son, she said, who was in the army. How friendly such things make strangers feel, don&rsquo;t
            they? She talked away all the time the man clipped, and diverted my mind nicely.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?&rdquo; asked Meg, with a shiver.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that was the end of it. I never snivel
            over trifles like that. I will confess, though, I felt queer</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>when I saw the dear old hair laid out on the table, and felt only the short, rough ends of my head. It almost
            seemed as if I&rsquo;d an arm or a leg off. The woman saw me look at it, and picked out a long lock for me
            to keep. I&rsquo;ll give it to you, Marmee, just to remember past glories by, for a crop is so comfortable I
            don&rsquo;t think I shall ever have a mane again.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk. She only said,
            &ldquo;Thank you, deary,&rdquo; but something in her face made the girls change the subject, and talk as
            cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s kindness, the prospect of a fine day tomorrow, and the
            happy times they would have when Father came home to be nursed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o&lsquo;clock Mrs. March put by the last finished job, and said,
            &ldquo;Come, girls.&rdquo; Beth went to the piano and played the father&rsquo;s favorite hymn; all began
            bravely, but broke down one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to her music
            was always a sweet consoler.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Go to bed and don&rsquo;t talk, for we must be up early and shall need all the sleep we can get. Good
            night, my darlings,&rdquo; said Mrs. March, as the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room. Beth and
            Amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious thoughts
            she had ever known in her short life. Jo lay motionless, and her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a
            stifled sob made her exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo, dear, what is it? Are you crying about Father?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, not now.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My&mdash;my hair!&rdquo; burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her emotion in the pillow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It did not sound at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest
            manner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry,&rdquo; protested Jo, with a choke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do it again tomorrow, if I
            could. It&rsquo;s only the vain, selfish part of me that goes and cries in this silly way. Don&rsquo;t tell
            anyone, it&rsquo;s all over now. I thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my one
            beauty. How came you to be awake?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep, I&rsquo;m so anxious,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Think about something pleasant, and you&rsquo;ll soon drop off.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What did you think of?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Handsome faces&mdash;eyes particularly,&rdquo; answered Meg, smiling to herself in the dark.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What color do you like best?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Brown&mdash;that is, sometimes; blue are lovely.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then amiably promised to make her hair curl, and fell
            asleep to dream of living in her castle in the air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed,
            smoothing a coverlid here, settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each
            unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to pray the fervent prayers which only
            mothers utter. As she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly from
            behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright, benignant face, which seemed to whisper in the silence,
            &ldquo;Be comforted, dear soul! There is always light behind the clouds.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>16</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Letters</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt
            before; for now the shadow of a real trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort; and
            as they dressed, they agreed to say good-by cheerfully and hopefully, and send their mother on her anxious
            journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them. Everything seemed very strange when they went
            down&mdash;so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within. Breakfast at that early hour seemed
            odd, and even Hannah&rsquo;s familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap
            on. The big trunk stood ready in the hall, Mother&rsquo;s cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa, and Mother
            herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found
            it very hard to keep their resolution. Meg&rsquo;s eyes kept filling in spite of herself, Jo was obliged to
            hide her face in the kitchen roller<u><sup>ct</sup></u> more than once, and the little girls wore a grave,
            troubled expression, as if sorrow was a new experience to them.</p>
        <p>Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage, Mrs. March said to
            the girls, who were all busied about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of her
            bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up her traveling bag&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Children, I leave you to Hannah&rsquo;s care and Mr. Laurence&rsquo;s protection. Hannah is
            faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own. I have no fears for you,
            yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. Don&rsquo;t grieve and fret when I am gone, or
            think that you can comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget. Go on with your work as usual, for
            work is a blessed solace. Hope and keep busy, and whatever happens, remember that you never can be
            fatherless.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and, in any perplexity, go to Mr.
            Laurence. Be patient Jo, don&rsquo;t get despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my brave
            girl, ready to help and cheer us all. Beth, comfort yourself with your music, and be faithful to the little
            home duties; and you, Amy, help all you can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We will, Mother! We will!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen. That was the hard minute, but the girls
            stood it well: no one cried, no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very heavy
            as they sent loving messages to Father, remembering, as they spoke, that it might be too late to deliver
            them. They kissed their mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands cheerfully
            when she drove away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind
            that the girls christened him &ldquo;Mr.</p>
        <p>Greatheart&rdquo;<u><sup>cu</sup></u> on the spot.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good-by, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!&rdquo; whispered Mrs. March, as she kissed one dear
            little face after the other, and hurried into the carriage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a
            good omen. They saw it also, and smiled and waved their hands; and the last thing she beheld as she turned
            the corner was the four bright faces, and behind them like a bodyguard old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah,
            and devoted Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How kind everyone is to us!&rdquo; she said, turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful
            sympathy of the young man&rsquo;s face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they can help it,&rdquo; returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so infectiously that Mrs.
            March could not help smiling; and so the long journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and
            cheerful words.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I feel as if there had been an earthquake,&rdquo; said Jo, as their neighbors went home to breakfast,
            leaving them to rest and refresh themselves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It seems as if half the house was gone,&rdquo; added Meg forlornly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on
            Mother&rsquo;s table, showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them. It
            was a little thing, but it went straight to their hearts; and in spite of their brave resolutions, they all
            broke down and cried bitterly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when the shower showed signs of clearing up, she
            came to the rescue, armed with a coffeepot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don&rsquo;t fret. Come and have a cup of
            coffee all round, and then let&rsquo;s fall to work and be a credit to the family.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that morning. No one could resist her
            persuasive nods, or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffeepot. They drew up to the
            table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten minutes were all right again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Hope and keep busy,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the motto for us, so let&rsquo;s see who will remember
            it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won&rsquo;t she lecture though!&rdquo; said Jo, as she
            sipped with returning spirit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall go to my Kings, though I&rsquo;d much rather stay at home and attend to things here,&rdquo;
            said Meg, wishing she hadn&rsquo;t made her eyes so red. &ldquo;No need of that. Beth and I can keep house
            perfectly well,&rdquo; put in Amy, with an important air.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hannah will tell us what to do, and we&rsquo;ll have everything nice when you come home,&rdquo; added
            Beth, getting out her mop and dish tub without delay. &ldquo;I think anxiety is very interesting,&rdquo;
            observed Amy, eating sugar pensively.</p>
        <p>The girls couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg shook her head at the young lady
            who could find consolation in a sugar bowl.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again, and when the two went out to their daily tasks, they looked
            sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother&rsquo;s face. It was gone, but
            Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she was, nodding away at them like a rosy-faced
            mandarin.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so like my Beth!&rdquo; said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful face. &ldquo;Good-by,
            Meggy, I hope the Kings won&rsquo;t train<u><sup>cv</sup></u> today. Don&rsquo;t fret about Father,
            dear,&rdquo; she added, as they parted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And I hope Aunt March won&rsquo;t croak. Your hair is becoming, and it looks very boyish and
            nice,&rdquo; returned Meg, trying not to smile at the curly head, which looked comically small on her tall
            sister&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my only comfort.&rdquo; And, touching her hat &agrave; la Laurie, away went Jo, feeling
            like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>News from their father comforted the girls very much, for, though dangerously ill, the presence of the best
            and tenderest of nurses had already done him good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and as the head of
            the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, which grew more and more cheering as the week passed. At
            first, everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by one or
            other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their Washington correspondence. As one of these
            packets contained characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and read them:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MY DEAREST MOTHER,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, for the news was so good we couldn&rsquo;t
            help laughing and crying over it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence&rsquo;s
            business detains him near you so long, since he is so useful to you and Father. The girls are all as good as
            gold. Jo helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs. I should be afraid she might
            overdo, if I didn&rsquo;t know that her &lsquo;moral fit&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t last long. Beth is as regular
            about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what you told her. She grieves about Father, and looks sober
            except when she is at her little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and I take great care of her. She does her own
            hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings. She tries very hard, and I know you
            will be pleased with her improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen, as
            Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes,
            and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah is a perfect saint; she does not scold at all, and
            always calls me Miss &lsquo;Margaret,&rsquo; which is quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect. We
            are all well and busy; but we long, day and night, to have you back. Give my dearest love to Father, and
            believe me, ever your own</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MEG.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to the next, which was scribbled on a big
            sheet of thin foreign paper, ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed letters:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MY PRECIOUS MARMEE,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Three cheers for dear Father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph right off, and let us know the minute he was
            better. I rushed up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank God for being so good to us; but I could
            only cry, and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad! I&rsquo;m glad!&rdquo; Didn&rsquo;t that do as well as a regular
            prayer? For I felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times; and now I can enjoy them, for
            everyone is so desperately good, it&rsquo;s like living in a nest of turtledoves. You&rsquo;d laugh to see
            Meg head the table and try to be mother ish. She gets prettier every day, and I&rsquo;m in love with her
            sometimes. The children are regular arch-angels, and I&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m Jo, and never shall be anything
            else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly
            little thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn&rsquo;t speak as I ought, and he marched home,
            saying he wouldn&rsquo;t come again till I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn&rsquo;t and got mad. It lasted
            all day, I felt bad and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are both so proud, it&rsquo;s hard to beg pardon;
            but I thought he&rsquo;d come to it, for I was in the right. He didn&rsquo;t come; and just at night I
            remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river. I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to
            let the sun set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met him at the gate, coming for the
            same thing. We both laughed, begged each other&rsquo;s pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I made a &ldquo;pome&rdquo; yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash; and, as Father likes my silly little
            things, I put it in to amuse him. Give him the lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself a dozen times
            for your</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>TOPSY-TURVY Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A SONG FROM THE SUDS.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Queen of my tub, I merrily sing,</p>
        <p>While the white foam rises high;</p>
        <p>And sturdily wash and rinse and wring,</p>
        <p>And fasten the clothes to dry;</p>
        <p>Then out in the free fresh air they swing,</p>
        <p>Under the sunny sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I wish we could wash from our hearts and souls</p>
        <p>The stains of the week away,</p>
        <p>And let water and air by their magic make</p>
        <p>Ourselves as pure as they;</p>
        <p>Then on the earth there would be indeed</p>
        <p>A glorious washing-day!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Along the path of a useful life,</p>
        <p>Will heartsease ever bloom;</p>
        <p>The busy mind has no time to think</p>
        <p>Of sorrow or care or gloom;</p>
        <p>And anxious thoughts may be swept away,</p>
        <p>As we bravely wield a broom.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am glad a task to me is given,</p>
        <p>To labor at day by day;</p>
        <p>For it brings me health and strength and hope,</p>
        <p>And I cheerfully learn to say,&mdash;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel,</p>
        <p>But, Hand, you shall work alway!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DEAR MOTHER,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There is only room for me to send my love, and some pressed pansies from the root I have been keeping safe in
            the house for Father to see. I read every morning, try to be good all day, and sing myself to sleep with
            Father&rsquo;s tune. I can&rsquo;t sing &ldquo;Land of the Leal&rdquo;<u><sup>cw</sup></u> now, it makes me
            cry. Everyone is</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>very kind, and we are as happy as we can be without you. Amy wants the rest of the page, so I must stop. I
            didn&rsquo;t forget to cover the holders, and I wind the clock and air the rooms every day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine. Oh, do come soon to your loving</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>LITTLE BETH.</p>
        <p>MA CHERE MAMMA,<u><sup>cx</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We are all well I do my lessons always and never corroberate the girls&mdash;Meg says I mean contradick so I
            put in both words and you can take the properest. Meg is a great comfort to me and lets me have jelly every
            night at tea its so good for me Jo says because it keeps me sweet tempered. Laurie is not as respeckful as
            he ought to be now I am almost in my teens, he calls me Chick and hurts my feelings by talking French to me
            very fast when I say Merci or Bon jour as Hattie King does. The sleeves of my blue dress were all worn out,
            and Meg put in new ones, but the full front came wrong and they are more blue than the dress. I felt bad but
            did not fret I bear my troubles well but I do wish Hannah would put more starch in my aprons and have
            buckwheats every day. Can&rsquo;t she? Didn&rsquo;t I make that interrigation point nice? Meg says my
            punchtu ation and spelling are disgraceful and I am mortyfied but dear me I have so many things to do, I
            can&rsquo;t stop. Adieu, I send heaps of love to Papa.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Your affectionate daughter,</p>
        <p>AMY CURTIS MARCH.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DEAR MIS MARCH,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate. The girls is clever and fly round right smart. Miss Meg is
            going to make a proper good housekeeper; she hes the liking for it, and gits the hang of things sur prisin
            quick. Jo doos beat all for goin ahead, but she don&rsquo;t stop to cal&lsquo;k&rsquo;late fust, and you
            never know where she&rsquo;s like to bring up. She done out a tub of clothes on Monday, but she starched em
            afore they was wrenched, and blued a pink calico dress till I thought I should a died a laughin. Beth is the
            best of little creeters, and a sight of help to me, bein so forehanded and dependable. She tries to learn
            everything, and really goes to market beyond her years; likewise keeps accounts, with my help, quite
            wonderful. We have got on very economical so fur; I don&rsquo;t let the girls hev coffee only once a week,
            accordin to your wish, and keep em on plain wholesome vittles. Amy does well about frettin, wearin her best
            clothes and eatin sweet stuff. Mr. Laurie is as full of didoes<u><sup>cy</sup></u> as usual, and turns the
            house upside down frequent; but he heartens up the girls, and so I let em hev full swing. The old gentleman
            sends heaps of things, and is rather wearin, but means wal, and it aint my place to say nothin. My bread is
            riz, so no more at this time. I send my duty to Mr. March and hope he&rsquo;s seen the last of his Pewmonia.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yours Respectful,</p>

        <p>HEAD NURSE OF WARD No. 2,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All serene on the Rappahannock<u><sup>cz</sup></u> troops in fine condition, commissary department well
            conducted, the Home Guard under Colonel Teddy always on duty, Commander in Chief General Laurence reviews
            the army daily, Quartermaster Mullett keeps order in camp, and Major Lion does picket duty at night. A
            salute of twenty-four guns was fired on receipt of good news from Washington, and a dress parade took place
            at headquarters. Commander in chief sends best wishes, in which he is heartily joined by</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DEAR MADAM,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The little girls are all well; Beth and my boy report daily; Hannah is a model servant, and guards pretty Meg
            like a dragon. Glad the fine weather holds; pray make Brooke useful, and draw on me for funds if expenses
            exceed your estimate. Don&rsquo;t let your husband want anything. Thank God he is mending.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Your sincere friend and servant,</p>
        <p>JAMES LAURENCE.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>17</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Little Faithful</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood. It was really amazing,
            for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. Relieved of their
            first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little, and
            began to fall back into the old ways. They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy seemed to
            grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, they felt that Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a
            good many.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough, and was ordered to stay at home till she
            was better, for Aunt March didn&rsquo;t like to hear people read with colds in their heads. Jo liked this,
            and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with
            arsenicum<u><sup>da</sup></u> and books. Amy found that housework and art did not go well together, and
            returned to her mud pies. Meg went daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much
            time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading the Washington dispatches over and over.
            Beth kept on, with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her sisters&rsquo; also, for they were
            forgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting. When her heart got heavy
            with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the folds
            of a certain dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself. Nobody
            knew what cheered her up after a sober fit, but everyone felt how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into
            a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs.</p>
        <p>All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character, and when the first excitement was over,
            felt that they had done well and deserved praise. So they did, but their mistake was in ceasing to do well,
            and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Meg, I wish you&rsquo;d go and see the Hummels; you know Mother told us not to forget them,&rdquo;
            said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March&rsquo;s departure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired to go this afternoon,&rdquo; replied Meg, rocking comfortably as she sewed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you, Jo?&rdquo; asked Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Too stormy for me with my cold.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought it was almost well.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to go to the
            Hummels&lsquo;,&rdquo; said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of her inconsistency.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go yourself?&rdquo; asked Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I have been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don&rsquo;t know what to do for it. Mrs. Hummel
            goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of it; but it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah
            ought to go.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go tomorrow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth, the air will do you good,&rdquo; said
            Jo, adding apologetically, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go, but I want to finish my writing.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My head aches and I&rsquo;m tired, so I thought maybe some of you would go,&rdquo; said Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us,&rdquo; suggested Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll rest a little and wait for her.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and the Hummels were forgotten. An hour
            passed: Amy did not come, Meg went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her story, and
            Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly put on her hood, filled her basket with
            odds and ends for the poor children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look
            in her patient eyes. It was late when she came back, and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into
            her mother&rsquo;s room. Half an hour after, Jo went to &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s closet&rdquo; for something,
            and there found Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very grave, with red eyes and a
            camphor-bottle<u><sup>db</sup></u> in her hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Christopher Columbus! What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Jo, as Beth put out her hand as if to warn
            her off, and asked quickly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had the scarlet fever, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Years ago, when Meg did. Why?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you. Oh, Jo, the baby&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What baby?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hummel&rsquo;s; it died in my lap before she got home,&rdquo; cried Beth with a sob.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My poor dear, how dreadful for you! I ought to have gone,&rdquo; said Jo, taking her sister in her
            arms as she sat down in her mother&rsquo;s big chair, with a remorseful face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t dreadful, Jo, only so sad! I saw in a minute that it was sicker, but Lottchen said her
            mother had gone for a doctor, so I took Baby and let Lotty rest. It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden it
            gave a little cry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its feet, and Lotty gave it some
            milk, but it didn&rsquo;t stir, and I knew it was dead.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, dear! What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor. He said it was dead, and looked
            at Heinrich and Minna, who have got sore throats. &lsquo;Scarlet fever, ma&rsquo;am. Ought to have called me
            before,&rsquo; he said crossly. Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure Baby herself, but
            now it was too late, and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay. He
            smiled then, and was kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned round all of a
            sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right away, or I&rsquo;d have the fever.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, you won&lsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look. &ldquo;Oh, Beth, if
            you should be sick I never could forgive myself! What shall we do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,
            I guess I shan&rsquo;t have it badly. I looked in Mother&rsquo;s book, and saw that it begins with headache,
            sore throat, and queer feelings like</p>
        <p>mine, so I did take some belladonna,<u><sup>dc</sup></u> and I feel better,&rdquo; said Beth, laying her cold
            hands on her hot forehead and trying to look well.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If Mother was only at home!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and feeling that Washington was an
            immense way off. She read a page, looked at Beth,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said gravely, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been over the baby every
            day for more than a week, and among the others who are going to have it; so I&rsquo;m afraid you are going
            to have it, Beth. I&rsquo;ll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Amy come; she never had it, and I should hate to give it to her. Can&rsquo;t you and
            Meg have it over again?&rdquo; asked Beth, anxiously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I guess not; don&rsquo;t care if I do; serve me right, selfish pig, to let you go, and stay writing
            rubbish myself!&rdquo; muttered Jo, as she went to consult Hannah.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once, assuring Jo that there was no need to
            worry; everyone had scarlet fever, and if rightly treated, nobody died&mdash;all of which Jo believed, and
            felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Hannah, when she had examined and questioned
            Beth, &ldquo;we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at you, dear, and see that we start right; then
            we&rsquo;ll send Amy off to Aunt March&rsquo;s for a spell, to keep her out of harm&rsquo;s way, and one of
            you girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall stay, of course, I&rsquo;m oldest,&rdquo; began Meg, looking anxious and self-reproachful.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall, because it&rsquo;s my fault she is sick; I told Mother I&rsquo;d do the errands, and I
            haven&lsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jo decidedly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Which will you have, Beth? There ain&rsquo;t no need of but one,&rdquo; said Hannah.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo, please.&rdquo; And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look, which
            effectually settled that point.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and tell Amy,&rdquo; said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather relieved on the whole,
            for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to Aunt March.
            Meg reasoned, pleaded, and commanded: all in vain. Amy protested that she would not go, and Meg left her in
            despair to ask Hannah what should be done. Before she came back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy
            sobbing, with her head in the sofa cushions. She told her story, expecting to be consoled, but Laurie only
            put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep
            thought. Presently he sat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, &ldquo;Now be a sensible
            little woman, and do as they say. No, don&rsquo;t cry, but hear what a jolly plan I&rsquo;ve got. You go to
            Aunt March&lsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ll come and take you out every day, driving or walking, and we&rsquo;ll have
            capital times. Won&rsquo;t that be better than moping here?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,&rdquo; began Amy in an injured voice.
            &ldquo;Bless your heart, child, it&rsquo;s to keep you well. You don&rsquo;t want to be sick, do you?&rdquo;
            &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t; but I dare say I shall be, for I&rsquo;ve been with Beth all the
            time.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may escape it. Change of air
            and care will keep you well, I dare say, or if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly. I
            advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke, miss.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s dull at Aunt March&lsquo;s, and she is so cross,&rdquo; said Amy, looking rather
            frightened.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is, and take you out
            gallivanting. The old lady likes me, and I&rsquo;ll be as sweet as possible to her, so she won&rsquo;t peck
            at us, whatever we do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;On my honor as a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And come every single day?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;See if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And bring me back the minute Beth is well?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The identical minute.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And go to the theater, truly?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A dozen theaters, if we may.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I guess&mdash;I will,&rdquo; said Amy slowly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good girl! Call Meg, and tell her you&rsquo;ll give in,&rdquo; said Laurie, with an approving pat,
            which annoyed Amy more than the &ldquo;giving in.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and
            self-sacrificing, promised to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How is the little dear?&rdquo; asked Laurie, for Beth was his especial pet, and he felt more anxious
            about her than he liked to show.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She is lying down on Mother&rsquo;s bed, and feels better. The baby&rsquo;s death troubled her, but I
            dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says she thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me
            fidgety,&rdquo; answered Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What a trying world it is!&rdquo; said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful sort of way. &ldquo;No
            sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything to hold
            on to when Mother&rsquo;s gone, so I&rsquo;m all at sea.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t make a porcupine of yourself, it isn&rsquo;t becoming. Settle your wig, Jo, and tell
            me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do anything?&rdquo; asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled
            to the loss of his friend&rsquo;s one beauty.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That is what troubles me,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;I think we ought to tell her if Beth is really ill,
            but Hannah says we mustn&lsquo;t, for Mother can&rsquo;t leave Father, and it will only make them anxious.
            Beth won&rsquo;t be sick long, and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her, so I
            suppose we must, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem quite right to me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hum, well, I can&rsquo;t say. Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor has been.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We will. Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once,&rdquo; commanded Meg. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t decide anything
            till he has been.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stay where you are, Jo. I&rsquo;m errand boy to this establishment,&rdquo;
            said Laurie, taking up his cap. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are busy,&rdquo; began Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve done my lessons for the day.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you study in vacation time?&rdquo; asked Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I follow the good example my neighbors set me&rdquo; was Laurie&rsquo;s answer, as he swung himself
            out of the room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I have great hopes of my boy,&rdquo; observed Jo, watching him fly over the fence with an approving
            smile.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He does very well&mdash;for a boy&rdquo; was Meg&rsquo;s somewhat ungracious answer, for the subject
            did not interest her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but thought she would have it lightly, though he looked
            sober over the Hummel story. Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off danger,
            she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What do you want now?&rdquo; she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles, while the parrot, sitting
            on the back of her chair, called out&mdash; &ldquo;Go away. No boys allowed here.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks. Amy can stay and make
            herself useful if she isn&rsquo;t sick, which I&rsquo;ve no doubt she will be&mdash;looks like it now.
            Don&rsquo;t cry, child, it worries me to hear people sniff.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot&rsquo;s tail, which caused Polly to utter
            an astonished croak and call out, &ldquo;Bless my boots!&rdquo; in such a funny way, that she laughed
            instead.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What do you hear from your mother?&rdquo; asked the old lady gruffly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Father is much better,&rdquo; replied Jo, trying to keep sober.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, is he? Well, that won&rsquo;t last long, I fancy. March never had any stamina&rdquo; was the
            cheerful reply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, good-by, good-by!&rdquo; squalled Polly, dancing on her
            perch, and clawing at the old lady&rsquo;s cap as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! And, Jo, you&rsquo;d better go at once; it isn&rsquo;t
            proper to be gadding about so late with a rat tlepated boy like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!&rdquo; cried Polly, tumbling off the chair with a
            bounce, and running to peck the &ldquo;rat tlepated&rdquo; boy, who was shaking with laughter at the last
            speech.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can bear it, but I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; thought Amy, as she was left alone with
            Aunt March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Get along, you fright!&rdquo; screamed Polly, and at that rude speech Amy could not restrain a sniff.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>18</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dark Days</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and the doctor suspected. The girls knew
            nothing about illness, and Mr. Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything all her own
            way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the excellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest
            she should infect the Kings, and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters
            in which no mention was made of Beth&rsquo;s illness. She could not think it right to deceive her mother,
            but she had been bidden to mind Hannah, and Hannah wouldn&rsquo;t hear of &ldquo;Mrs. March bein&rsquo;
            told, and worried just for sech a trifle.&rdquo; Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night&mdash;not a hard
            task, for Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself. But
            there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the
            coverlet as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music
            left; a time when she did not know the familiar faces round her, but addressed them by wrong names, and
            called imploringly for her mother. Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth, and
            even Hannah said she &ldquo;would think of it, though there was no danger yet.&rdquo; A letter from
            Washington added to their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of coming home for a
            long while.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as
            they worked and waited, while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home! Then it was that
            Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how rich she had been in things more
            precious than any luxuries money could buy&mdash;in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings
            of life. Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that suffering little sister always before
            her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of
            Beth&rsquo;s nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts, and to acknowledge the
            worth of Beth&rsquo;s unselfish ambition to live for others, and make home happy by the exercise of those
            simple virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more than talent, wealth, or
            beauty. And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that
            no service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how many neglected tasks those
            willing hands had done for her. Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked the
            grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight
            pleasant for him. Everyone missed Beth. The milk-man, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she did, poor
            Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all
            sorts of comforts and good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends
            shy little Beth had made.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in her wanderings she did not forget her
            forlorn prot&eacute;g&eacute;. She longed for her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should
            get sick, and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo. She sent loving messages to Amy, bade
            them tell her mother that she would write soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word,
            that Father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these intervals of consciousness ended, and
            she lay hour after hour, tossing to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy sleep
            which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day, Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in
            her desk all ready to send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth&rsquo;s side.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year
            seemed getting ready for its death. When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held the hot
            hand in both his own a minute, and laid it gently down, saying, in a low tone, to Hannah, &ldquo;If Mrs.
            March can leave her husband she&rsquo;d better be sent for.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, Meg dropped down into a chair as the
            strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words, and Jo, after standing with a pale face
            for a minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and, throwing on her things, rushed out into the
            storm. She was soon back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying
            that Mr. March was mending again. Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her
            heart, and her face was so full of misery that Laurie asked quickly, &ldquo;What is it? Is Beth
            worse?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent for Mother,&rdquo; said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a tragic expression.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility?&rdquo; asked Laurie, as he seated her in
            the hall chair and took off the rebellious boots, seeing how her hands shook.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, the doctor told us to.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Jo, it&rsquo;s not so bad as that?&rdquo; cried Laurie, with a startled face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, it is; she doesn&rsquo;t know us, she doesn&rsquo;t even talk about the flocks of green doves, as
            she calls the vine leaves on the wall; she doesn&rsquo;t look like my Beth, and there&rsquo;s nobody to help
            us bear it; Mother and Father both gone, and God seems so far away I can&rsquo;t find Him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo&rsquo;s cheeks, she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way,
            as if groping in the dark, and Laurie took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a lump in his
            throat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. Hold onto me, Jo, dear!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She could not speak, but she did &ldquo;hold on,&rdquo; and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand
            comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in
            her trouble. Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting words came to him, so he
            stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do. It was the best thing he could have
            done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken sympathy, and in the silence
            learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow. Soon she dried the tears which had relieved
            her, and looked up with a grateful face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Teddy, I&rsquo;m better now. I don&rsquo;t feel so forlorn, and will try to bear it if it
            comes.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo. Soon your mother will be here, and then everything
            will be right.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad Father is better; now she won&rsquo;t feel so bad about leaving him. Oh, me! It does
            seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and I got the heaviest part on my shoulders,&rdquo; sighed Jo,
            spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Meg pull fair?&rdquo; asked Laurie, looking indignant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can&rsquo;t love Bethy as I do, and she won&rsquo;t miss her as I
            shall. Beth is my conscience, and I can&rsquo;t give her up. I can&lsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Down went Jo&rsquo;s face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried despairingly, for she had kept up bravely
            till now and never shed a tear. Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till he had
            subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. It might be unmanly, but he couldn&rsquo;t
            help it, and I am glad of it. Presently, as Jo&rsquo;s sobs quieted, he said hopefully, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
            think she will die; she&rsquo;s so good, and we all love her so much, I don&rsquo;t</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>believe God will take her away yet.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The good and dear people always do die,&rdquo; groaned Jo, but she stopped crying, for her
            friend&rsquo;s words cheered her up in spite of her own doubts and fears.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Poor girl, you&rsquo;re worn out. It isn&rsquo;t like you to be forlorn. Stop a bit. I&rsquo;ll
            hearten you up in jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down on Beth&rsquo;s little brown hood,
            which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it. It must have possessed some magic, for
            the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and when Laurie came running down with a
            glass of wine, she took it with a smile, and said bravely, &ldquo;I drink&mdash;Health to my Beth! You are a
            good doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable friend. How can I ever pay you?&rdquo; she added, as the wine
            refreshed her body, as the kind words had done her troubled mind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send in my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I&rsquo;ll give you something that will warm the
            cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine,&rdquo; said Laurie, beaming at her with a face of
            suppressed satisfaction at something.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she&rsquo;d come at once, and she&rsquo;ll
            be here tonight, and everything will be all right. Aren&rsquo;t you glad I did it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for he had kept his plot a secret, for
            fear of disappointing the girls or harming Beth. Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the moment
            he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful
            cry, &ldquo;Oh, Laurie! Oh, Mother! I am so glad!&rdquo; She did not weep again, but laughed hysterically,
            and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind; he patted her back soothingly, and
            finding that she was recovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at once.
            Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying breathlessly, &ldquo;Oh, don&lsquo;t! I
            didn&rsquo;t mean to, it was dreadful of me, but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah
            that I couldn&rsquo;t help flying at you. Tell me all about it, and don&rsquo;t give me wine again, it makes
            me act so.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie. &ldquo;Why, you see I got fidgety,
            and so did Grandpa. We thought Hannah was overdoing the authority business, and your mother ought to know.
            She&rsquo;d never forgive us if Beth&mdash;well, if anything happened, you know. So I got Grandpa to say it
            was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and
            Hannah most took my head off when I proposed a telegram. I never can bear to be &lsquo;lorded over,&rsquo;
            so that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I know, and the late train is in at two A.M. I
            shall go for her, and you&rsquo;ve only got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till that blessed
            lady gets here.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Laurie, you&rsquo;re an angel! How shall I ever thank you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Fly at me again; I rather like it,&rdquo; said Laurie, looking mischievous&mdash;a thing he had not
            done for a fortnight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, thank you. I&rsquo;ll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don&rsquo;t tease, but go home and
            rest, for you&rsquo;ll be up half the night. Bless you, Teddy, bless you!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo had backed into a comer, and as she finished her speech, she vanished precipitately into the kitchen,
            where she sat down upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was &ldquo;happy, oh, so
            happy!&rdquo; while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made rather a neat thing of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do hope Mrs. March is coming on
            right away,&rdquo; said Hannah, with an air of relief, when Jo told the good news.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set the sickroom in order, and Hannah
            &ldquo;knocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected.&rdquo; A breath of fresh air seemed to
            blow through the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms. Everything appeared
            to feel the hopeful change; Beth&rsquo;s bird began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on
            Amy&rsquo;s bush in the window; the fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness; and every time the girls
            met, their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another, whispering encourag ingly,
            &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s coming, dear! Mother&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; Every one rejoiced but Beth; she lay in
            that heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It was a piteous sight&mdash;the
            once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite
            dumb, and the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. All day she lay so,
            only rousing now and then to mutter, &ldquo;Water!&rdquo; with lips so parched they could hardly shape the
            word; all day Jo and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God and Mother; and
            all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours dragged slowly by. But night came at last, and
            every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side the bed, looked at each other with
            brightening eyes, for each hour brought help nearer. The doctor had been in to say that some change, for
            better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which time he would return.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed&rsquo;s foot and fell fast asleep, Mr. Laurence
            marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March&rsquo;s
            anxious countenance as she entered. Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring into the fire
            with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch, with that dreadful
            sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If God spares Beth, I never will complain again,&rdquo; whispered Meg earnestly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If God spares Beth, I&rsquo;ll try to love and serve Him all my life,&rdquo; answered Jo, with equal
            fervor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish I had no heart, it aches so,&rdquo; sighed Meg, after a pause.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If life is often as hard as this, I don&rsquo;t see how we ever shall get through it,&rdquo; added her
            sister despondently.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching Beth, for they fancied a change passed
            over her wan face. The house was still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep
            hush. Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the
            little bed. An hour went by, and nothing happened except Laurie&rsquo;s quiet departure for the station.
            Another hour&mdash;still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the storm, or accidents by the way, or,
            worst of all, a great grief at Washington, haunted the poor girls.</p>
        <p>It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet
            of snow, heard a movement by the bed, and, turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother&rsquo;s
            easy chair with her face hidden. A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as she thought, &ldquo;Beth is dead,
            and Meg is afraid to tell me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place.
            The fever flush and the look of pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in
            its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament. Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters,
            she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, &ldquo;Good-by, my Beth;
            good-by!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As if waked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands,
            listened at her lips, and then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro, exclaiming,
            under her breath, &ldquo;The fever&rsquo;s turned, she&rsquo;s sleepin&rsquo; nat&lsquo;ral, her
            skin&rsquo;s damp, and she</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>breathes easy. Praise be given! Oh, my goodness me!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to confirm it. He was a homely man, but they
            thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, &ldquo;Yes, my dears,
            I think the little girl will pull through this time. Keep the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she
            wakes, give her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held
            each other close, rejoicing with hearts too full for words. When they went back to be kissed and cuddled by
            faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful
            pallor gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If Mother would only come now!&rdquo; said Jo, as the winter night began to wane.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, &ldquo;I thought this would hardly be
            ready to lay in Beth&rsquo;s hand tomorrow if she&mdash;went away from us. But it has blossomed in the
            night, and now I mean to put it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she sees
            will be the little rose, and Mother&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes
            of Meg and Jo, as they looked out in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It looks like a fairy world,&rdquo; said Meg, smiling to herself, as she stood behind the curtain,
            watching the dazzling sight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Jo, starting to her feet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah, and then Laurie&rsquo;s voice saying in
            a joyful whisper, &ldquo;Girls, she&rsquo;s come! She&rsquo;s come!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>19</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy&rsquo;s Will</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While these things were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at Aunt March&rsquo;s. She felt her
            exile deeply, and, for the first time in her life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home.
            Aunt March never petted any one; she did not approve of it; but she meant to be kind, for the well-behaved
            little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew&rsquo;s
            children, though she didn&rsquo;t think proper to confess it. She really did her best to make Amy happy,
            but, dear me, what mistakes she made! Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray
            hairs, can sympathize with children&rsquo;s little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise
            lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way. But Aunt March had not
            this gift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy talks.
            Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and
            counteract, as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So she took Amy in hand, and
            taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago&mdash;a process which carried dismay to
            Amy&rsquo;s soul, and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned spoons, the fat silver teapot, and
            the glasses till they shone. Then she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was! Not a speck
            escaped Aunt March&rsquo;s eye, and all the furniture had claw legs and much carving, which was never dusted
            to suit. Then Polly must be fed, the lap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or
            deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair. After these tiresome labors,
            she must do her lessons, which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed. Then she was allowed one
            hour for exercise or play, and didn&rsquo;t she enjoy it? Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March
            till Amy was allowed to go out with him, when they walked and rode and had capital times. After dinner, she
            had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped
            off over the first page. Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward
            rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till teatime. The evenings were the
            worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull
            that Amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep
            before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that she never could have got through that
            dreadful time. The parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not admire
            him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible. He pulled her hair whenever she came near
            him, upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking at
            him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and behaved in all respects like a reprehensible old
            bird. Then she could not endure the dog&mdash;a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made
            his toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of
            countenance when he wanted something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day. The cook was bad-tempered,
            the old coachman deaf, and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; as she called her mistress, for many
            years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady, who could not get along without her. Her real name was
            Estelle, but Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that she was never asked to
            change her religion. She took a fancy to Mademoiselle, and amused her very much with odd stories of her life
            in France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame&rsquo;s laces. She also allowed her to roam about
            the great house, and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient
            chests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. Amy&rsquo;s chief delight was an Indian cabinet, full of queer
            drawers, little pigeonholes, and secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious,
            some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and arrange these things gave Amy great
            satisfaction, especially the jewel cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had
            adorned a belle forty years ago. There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came out, the
            pearls her father gave her on her wedding day, her lover&rsquo;s diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins,
            the queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside, the baby
            bracelets her one little daughter had worn, Uncle March&rsquo;s big watch, with the red seal so many
            childish hands had played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March&rsquo;s wedding ring, too small
            now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?&rdquo; asked Esther, who always sat near to watch
            over and lock up the valuables.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I&rsquo;m fond of necklaces, they
            are so becoming. I should choose this if I might,&rdquo; replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a
            string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace; ah, no! To me it is a rosary, and as such I should use it
            like a good Catholic,&rdquo; said Esther, eying the handsome thing wistfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads hanging over your glass?&rdquo;
            asked Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Truly, yes, to pray with. It would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this,
            instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.&rdquo;<u><sup>dd</sup></u> &ldquo;You seem to take a great deal of
            comfort in your prayers, Esther, and always come down looking quiet and satisfied. I wish I could.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort; but as that is not to be, it would be
            well if you went apart each day to meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before Madame.
            She had a little chapel and in it found solacement for much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Would it be right for me to do so too?&rdquo; asked Amy, who in her loneliness felt the need of help
            of some sort, and found that she was apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind
            her of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange the little dressing room for you if you
            like it. Say nothing to Madame, but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts, and
            pray the dear God to preserve your sister.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she had an affectionate heart, and felt much for
            the sisters in their anxiety. Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her
            room, hoping it would do her good.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March dies,&rdquo; she said, as she
            slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the jewel cases one by one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;To you and your sisters. I know it, Madame confides in me. I witnessed her will, and it is to be
            so,&rdquo; whispered Esther, smiling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How nice! but I wish she&rsquo;d let us have them now. Pro-cras-ti-nation is not agreeable,&rdquo;
            observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The first one who is affianced will have
            the pearls&mdash;Madame has said it; and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you
            when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming manners.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you think so? Oh, I&rsquo;ll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely ring! It&rsquo;s ever so
            much prettier than Kitty Bryant&rsquo;s. I do like Aunt March, after all.&rdquo; And Amy tried on the blue
            ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady complacently admired the success of her
            training. Esther fitted up the closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a
            picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. She thought it was of no great value, but, being appropriate,
            she borrowed it, well knowing that Madame would never know it, nor care if she did. It was, however, a very
            valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and Amy&rsquo;s beauty-loving eyes were never
            tired of looking up at the sweet face of the divine mother, while tender thoughts of her own were busy at
            her heart. On the table she laid her little Testament and hymnbook, kept a vase always full of the best
            flowers Laurie brought her, and came every day to &ldquo;sit alone, thinking good thoughts, and praying the
            dear God to preserve her sister.&rdquo; Esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver cross,
            but Amy hung it up and did not use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left alone outside the safe home nest, she felt the
            need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender Friend,
            whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children. She missed her mother&rsquo;s help to
            understand and rule herself, but having been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way and walk
            in it confidingly. But Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden seemed very heavy. She tried to
            forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for
            it. In her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will, as Aunt March had done, so
            that if she did fall ill and die, her possessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her a pang
            even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old lady&rsquo;s
            jewels.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could, with some help from
            Esther as to certain legal terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy felt
            relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a second witness. As it was a rainy day, she went
            upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for company. In this room
            there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes with which Esther allowed her to play, and it was her
            favorite amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before the long mirror,
            making stately curtsies, and sweeping her train about with a rustle which delighted her ears. So busy was
            she on this day that she did not hear Laurie&rsquo;s ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she gravely
            promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban,
            contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She was obliged to walk
            carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see
            her mince along in her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her, imitating her as well as
            he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we fine? Get along, you fright!
            Hold your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped
            and was graciously received.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to consult you about a very serious
            matter,&rdquo; said Amy, when she had shown her splendor and driven Polly into a corner. &ldquo;That bird is
            the trial of my life,&rdquo; she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head, while Laurie seated
            himself astride of a chair. &ldquo;Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a
            mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage; so I went to let him out, and found a big spider
            there. I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase; Polly marched straight after it, stooped down and
            peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his eye, &lsquo;Come out and take a
            walk, my dear.&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us
            both.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Did the spider accept the old fellow&rsquo;s invitation?&rdquo; asked Laurie, yawning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and scrambled up on Aunt&rsquo;s chair,
            calling out, &lsquo;Catch her! Catch her! Catch her!&rsquo; as I chased the spider.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie! Oh lor!&rdquo; cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie&rsquo;s toes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,&rdquo; cried Laurie, shaking his fist at
            the bird, who put his head on one side and gravely croaked, &ldquo;Allyluyer! Bless your buttons,
            dear!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a paper out of her pocket.
            &ldquo;I want you to read that, please, and tell me if it is legal and right. I felt that I ought to do it,
            for life is uncertain and I don&rsquo;t want any ill feeling over my tomb.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker, read the following document, with
            praiseworthy gravity, considering the spelling:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, do give and bequeethe all my earthly
            property-viz.<u><sup>de</sup></u> to wit:&mdash;namely</p>
        <p>To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art, including frames. Also my $100, to do what
            he likes with.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets-also my likeness, and my medal, with much
            love.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it), also my green box with the doves on it,
            also my piece of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her &ldquo;little
            girl.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax, also my bronze inkstand&mdash;she lost the
            cover&mdash;and my most precious plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her story.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little bureau, my fan, my linen collars and my new
            slippers if she can wear them being thin when she gets well. And I herewith also leave her my regret that I
            ever made fun of old Joanna.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my paper mashay portfolio, my clay model of a horse
            though he did say it hadn&rsquo;t any neck. Also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction
            any one of my artistic works he likes, Noter Dame is the best.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a looking glass in the cover which will
            be nice for his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family,
            specially Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork I leave hoping she &ldquo;will remember me,
            when it you see.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be satisfied and not blame the dead. I
            forgive everyone, and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound. Amen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th day of Nov. Anni Domino 1861.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>AMY CURTIS MARCH</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Witnesses:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>ESTELLE VALNOR,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>THEODORE LAURENCE.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for
            her properly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What put it into your head? Did anyone tell you about Beth&rsquo;s giving away her things?&rdquo;
            asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape, with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She explained and then asked anxiously, &ldquo;What about Beth?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I spoke, but as I did, I&rsquo;ll tell you. She felt so ill one day that she told Jo
            she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her
            sake. She was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest of us, and her best love
            to Grandpa. She never thought of a will.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper.
            Amy&rsquo;s face was full of trouble; but she only said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t people put sort of postscripts
            to their wills, sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;codicils,&rsquo; they call them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Put one in mine then&mdash;that I wish all my curls cut off, and given round to my friends. I forgot
            it, but I want it done, though it will spoil my looks.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie added it, smiling at Amy&rsquo;s last and greatest sacrifice. Then he amused her for an hour, and was
            much interested in all her trials. But when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips,
            &ldquo;Is there really any danger about Beth?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don&rsquo;t cry, dear.&rdquo; And Laurie
            put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting in the twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming
            tears and an aching heart, feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her
            gentle little sister.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>20</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Confidential</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t think I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters; such hours are
            beautiful to live, but very hard to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers, merely
            saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that Meg&rsquo;s tender hope was realized; for when
            Beth woke from that long, healing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and
            Mother&rsquo;s face. Too weak to wonder at anything, she only smiled and nestled close into the loving arms
            about her, feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last. Then she slept again, and the girls waited
            upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep.</p>
        <p>Hannah had &ldquo;dished up&rdquo; an astonishing breakfast for the traveler, finding it impossible to vent
            her excitement in any other way; and Meg and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks, while they
            listened to her whispered account of Father&rsquo;s state, Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s promise to stay and nurse him,
            the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort Laurie&rsquo;s
            hopeful face had given her when she arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What a strange yet pleasant day that was! So brilliant and gay without, for all the world seemed abroad to
            welcome the first snow; so quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching, and a
            Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah mounted guard at the door. With a blissful
            sense of burdens lifted off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like storm-beaten boats
            safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. Mrs. March would not leave Beth&rsquo;s side, but rested in the big chair,
            waking often to look at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some recovered treasure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well that Aunt March actually
            &ldquo;sniffed&rdquo; herself, and never once said, &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; Amy came out so strong on
            this occasion that I think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. She dried her
            tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never even thought of the turquoise ring,
            when the old lady heartily agreed in Laurie&rsquo;s opinion, that she behaved &ldquo;like a capital little
            woman.&rdquo; Even Polly seemed impressed, for he called her &ldquo;good girl,&rdquo; blessed her buttons,
            and begged her to &ldquo;come and take a walk, dear,&rdquo; in his most affable tone. She would very gladly
            have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in
            spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note
            to her mother. She was a long time about it, and when she returned, he was stretched out with both arms
            under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an
            unusual fit of benignity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake till night, and I&rsquo;m not sure that he would,
            had he not been effectually roused by Amy&rsquo;s cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were a
            good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my private opinion that Amy was the
            happiest of all, when she sat in her mother&rsquo;s lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and
            compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone together in the chapel, to
            which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I like it very much, dear,&rdquo; looking from the dusty rosary to the well-worn
            little book, and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen. &ldquo;It is an excellent plan to have
            some place where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us. There are a good many hard times in
            this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way. I think my little girl is
            learning this.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy
            of that picture which I&rsquo;ve tried to make. The woman&rsquo;s face is not good&mdash;it&rsquo;s too
            beautiful for me to draw&mdash;but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I like to think He was
            a little child once, for then I don&rsquo;t seem so far away, and that helps me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his mother&rsquo;s knee, Mrs. March saw something on the lifted
            hand that made her smile. She said nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute&rsquo;s pause,
            she added gravely, &ldquo;I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it. Aunt gave me the ring today;
            she called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she&rsquo;d
            like to keep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as it&rsquo;s too big. I&rsquo;d
            like to wear them, Mother, can I?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They are very pretty, but I think you&rsquo;re rather too young for such ornaments, Amy,&rdquo; said
            Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand, with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the
            quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to be vain,&rdquo; said Amy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I like it only because
            it&rsquo;s so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet, to remind me of
            something.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you mean Aunt March?&rdquo; asked her mother, laughing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, to remind me not to be selfish.&rdquo; Amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother
            stopped laughing, and listened respectfully to the little plan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought a great deal lately about my &lsquo;bundle of naughties,&rsquo; and being selfish
            is the largest one in it; so I&rsquo;m going to try hard to cure it, if I can. Beth isn&rsquo;t selfish, and
            that&rsquo;s the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. People
            wouldn&rsquo;t feel half so bad about me if I was sick, and I don&rsquo;t deserve to have them; but
            I&rsquo;d like to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I&rsquo;m going to try and be like Beth
            all I can. I&rsquo;m apt to forget my resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, I
            guess I should do better. May I try this way?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your ring, dear, and do your best. I
            think you will prosper, for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle. Now I must go back to Beth. Keep
            up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you home again.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That evening, while Meg was writing to her father to report the traveler&rsquo;s safe arrival, Jo slipped
            upstairs into Beth&rsquo;s room, and finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her
            fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What is it, deary?&rdquo; asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a face which invited
            confidence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I want to tell you something, Mother.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;About Meg?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How quickly you guessed! Yes, it&rsquo;s about her, and though it&rsquo;s a little thing, it fidgets
            me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Beth is asleep; speak low, and tell me all about it. That Moffat hasn&rsquo;t been here, I
            hope?&rdquo; asked Mrs. March rather sharply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I should have shut the door in his face if he had,&rdquo; said Jo, settling herself on the floor
            at her mother&rsquo;s feet. &ldquo;Last summer Meg left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences&rsquo; and
            only one was returned. We forgot all about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke had it. He kept it in his
            waistcoat<u><sup>df</sup></u> pocket, and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>once it fell out, and Teddy joked him about it, and Mr. Brooke owned that he liked Meg but didn&rsquo;t dare
            say so, she was so young and he so poor. Now, isn&rsquo;t it a dreadful state of things?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you think Meg cares for him?&rdquo; asked Mrs. March, with an anxious look.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mercy me! I don&rsquo;t know anything about love and such nonsense!&rdquo; cried Jo, with a funny
            mixture of interest and contempt. &ldquo;In novels, the girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting
            away, growing thin, and acting like fools. Now Meg does not do anything of the sort: she eats and drinks and
            sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight in my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes
            a little bit when Teddy jokes about lovers. I forbid him to do it, but he doesn&rsquo;t mind me as he
            ought.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; cried Jo, staring.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mr. Brooke. I call him &lsquo;John&rsquo; now; we fell into the way of doing so at the hospital, and
            he likes it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! I know you&rsquo;ll take his part: he&rsquo;s been good to Father, and you won&rsquo;t send
            him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wants to. Mean thing! To go petting Papa and helping you, just to
            wheedle you into liking him.&rdquo; And Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My dear, don&rsquo;t get angry about it, and I will tell you how it happened. John went with me at Mr.
            Laurence&rsquo;s request, and was so devoted to poor Father that we couldn&rsquo;t help getting fond of him.
            He was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved her, but would earn a comfortable
            home before he asked her to marry him. He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the right
            to make her love him if he could. He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse to listen to
            him, but I will not consent to Meg&rsquo;s engaging herself so young.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course not; it would be idiotic! I knew there was mischief brewing, I felt it, and now it&rsquo;s
            worse than I imagined. I just wish I could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said gravely, &ldquo;Jo, I confide in you and don&rsquo;t
            wish you to say anything to Meg yet. When John comes back and I see them together, I can judge better of her
            feelings toward him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll see his in those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then it will be all up with her.
            She&rsquo;s got such a soft heart, it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentally at her.
            She read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me when I spoke of it, and
            likes brown eyes, and doesn&rsquo;t think John an ugly name, and she&rsquo;ll go and fall in love, and
            there&rsquo;s an end of peace and fun, and cozy times together. I see it all! They&rsquo;ll go lovering
            around the house, and we shall have to dodge; Meg will be absorbed, and no good to me any more; Brooke will
            scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off, and make a hole in the family; and I shall break my heart, and
            everything will be abominably uncomfortable. Oh, dear me! Why weren&rsquo;t we all boys, then there
            wouldn&rsquo;t be any bother.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible John. Mrs.
            March sighed, and Jo looked up with an air of relief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like it, Mother? I&rsquo;m glad of it. Let&rsquo;s send him about his business, and
            not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as we always have been.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I did wrong to sigh, Jo. It is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own in time, but I
            do want to keep my girls as long as I can; and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only
            seventeen and it will be some years before John can make a home for her. Your father and I have agreed that
            she shall not bind herself in any way, nor be married, before twenty. If she and John love one another, they
            can wait, and test their love by doing so. She is conscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him
            unkindly. My pretty, tenderhearted girl! I hope things will go happily with her.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you rather have her marry a rich man?&rdquo; asked Jo, as her mother&rsquo;s voice
            faltered a little over the last words.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Money is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly
            nor be tempted by too much. I should like to know that John was firmly established in some good business,
            which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make Meg comfortable. I&rsquo;m not
            ambitious for a splendid fortune, a fashionable position, or a great name for my girls. If rank and money
            come with love and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your good fortune; but I know,
            by experience, how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is
            earned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. I am content to see Meg begin humbly, for
            if I am not mistaken, she will be rich in the possession of a good man&rsquo;s heart, and that is better
            than a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I&rsquo;m disappointed about Meg, for I&rsquo;d planned to
            have her marry Teddy by-and-by and sit in the lap of luxury all her days. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice?&rdquo;
            asked Jo, looking up with a brighter face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He is younger than she, you know,&rdquo; began Mrs. March, but Jo broke in&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Only a little, he&rsquo;s old for his age, and tall, and can be quite grown-up in his manners if he
            likes. Then he&rsquo;s rich and generous and good, and loves us all, and I say it&rsquo;s a pity my plan is
            spoiled.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and altogether too much of a weathercock
            just now for anyone to depend on. Don&rsquo;t make plans, Jo, but let time and their own hearts mate your
            friends. We can&rsquo;t meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get &lsquo;romantic
            rubbish,&rsquo; as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I won&lsquo;t, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up, when a pull
            here and a snip there would straighten it out. I wish wearing flatirons<u><sup>dg</sup></u> on our heads
            would keep us from growing up. But buds will be roses, and kittens, cats&mdash;more&rsquo;s the pity!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that about flatirons and cats?&rdquo; asked Meg, as she crept into the room with the
            finished letter in her hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Only one of my stupid speeches. I&rsquo;m going to bed; come, Peggy,&rdquo; said Jo, unfolding herself
            like an animated puzzle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Quite right, and beautifully written. Please add that I send my love to John,&rdquo; said Mrs. March,
            as she glanced over the letter and gave it back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you call him &lsquo;John&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes looking down
            into her mother&rsquo;s.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,&rdquo; replied Mrs. March, returning
            the look with a keen one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that, he is so lonely. Good night, Mother, dear. It is so inexpressibly comfortable
            to have you here,&rdquo; was Meg&rsquo;s answer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and as she went away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of
            satisfaction and regret, &ldquo;She does not love John yet, but will soon learn to.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>21</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie Makes Mischief, and Jo Makes Peace</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo&rsquo;s face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her, and she found it hard not to
            look mysterious and important. Meg observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had
            learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so she felt sure of being told
            everything if she did not ask. She was rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and
            Jo assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in her turn assumed an air of dignified
            reserve and devoted herself to her mother. This left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her
            place as nurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long confinement. Amy being gone,
            Laurie was her only refuge; and much as she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he
            was an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax her secret from her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it
            out, and led Jo a trying life of it. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected
            indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he knew, then that he didn&rsquo;t care;
            and, at last, by dint of perseverance, he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke. Feeling
            indignant that he was not taken into his tutor&rsquo;s confidence, he set his wits to work to devise some
            proper retaliation for the slight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in preparations for her father&rsquo;s
            return, but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike
            herself. She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a
            timid, troubled look on her face. To her mother&rsquo;s inquiries she answered that she was quite well, and
            Jo&rsquo;s she silenced by begging to be let alone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She feels it in the air&mdash;love, I mean&mdash;and she&rsquo;s going very fast. She&rsquo;s got most
            of the symptoms&mdash;is twittery and cross, doesn&rsquo;t eat, lies awake, and mopes in corners. I caught
            her singing that song he gave her, and once she said &lsquo;John,&rsquo; as you do, and then turned as red
            as a poppy. Whatever shall we do?&rdquo; said Jo, looking ready for any measures, however violent.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nothing but wait. Let her alone, be kind and patient, and Father&rsquo;s coming will settle
            everything,&rdquo; replied her mother.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a note to you, Meg, all sealed up. How odd! Teddy never seals mine,&rdquo; said Jo next
            day, as she distributed the contents of the little post office.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg made them look up to see her staring
            at her note with a frightened face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My child, what is it?&rdquo; cried her mother, running to her, while Jo tried to take the paper which
            had done the mischief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a mistake&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t send it. Oh, Jo, how could you do it?&rdquo; and Meg
            hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart was quite broken.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Me! I&rsquo;ve done nothing! What&rsquo;s she talking about?&rdquo; cried Jo, bewildered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg&rsquo;s mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at Jo,
            saying reproachfully, &ldquo;You wrote it, and that bad boy helped you. How could you be so rude, so mean,
            and cruel to us both?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note, which was written in a peculiar hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;MY DEAREST MARGARET&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate before I return. I dare not tell your
            parents yet, but I think they would consent if they knew that we adored one another. Mr. Laurence will help
            me to some good place, and then, my sweet girl, you will make me happy. I implore you to say nothing to your
            family yet, but to send one word of hope through Laurie to</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your devoted JOHN.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, the little villain! That&rsquo;s the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to Mother.
            I&rsquo;ll give him a hearty scolding and bring him over to beg pardon,&rdquo; cried Jo, burning to execute
            immediate justice. But her mother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first. You have played so many pranks that I am afraid you have had
            a hand in this.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;On my word, Mother, I haven&lsquo;t! I never saw that note before, and don&rsquo;t know anything about
            it, as true as I live!&rdquo; said Jo, so earnestly that they believed her. &ldquo;If I had taken a part in
            it I&rsquo;d have done it better than this, and have written a sensible note. I should think you&rsquo;d
            have known Mr. Brooke wouldn&rsquo;t write such stuff as that,&rdquo; she added, scornfully tossing down the
            paper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like his writing,&rdquo; faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in her hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Meg, you didn&rsquo;t answer it?&rdquo; cried Mrs. March quickly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did!&rdquo; And Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a scrape! Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and be lectured. I can&rsquo;t
            rest till I get hold of him.&rdquo; And Jo made for the door again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hush! Let me manage this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret, tell me the whole story,&rdquo;
            commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg, yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn&rsquo;t look as if he knew anything about it,&rdquo;
            began Meg, without looking up. &ldquo;I was worried at first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how
            you liked Mr. Brooke, so I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t mind if I kept my little secret for a few days.
            I&rsquo;m so silly that I liked to think no one knew, and while I was deciding what to say, I felt like the
            girls in books, who have such things to do. Forgive me, Mother, I&rsquo;m paid for my silliness now; I never
            can look him in the face again.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What did you say to him?&rdquo; asked Mrs. March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I didn&rsquo;t wish to have secrets from
            you, and he must speak to Father. I was very grateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing
            more, for a long while.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands, exclaiming, with a laugh, &ldquo;You are
            almost equal to Caroline Percy,<u><sup>dh</sup></u> who was a pattern of prudence! Tell on, Meg. What did he
            say to that?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent any love letter at all, and is
            very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo, should take such liberties with our names. It&rsquo;s very kind and
            respectful, but think how dreadful for me!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo tramped about the room, calling Laurie
            names. All of a sudden she stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them closely, said
            decidedly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Brooke ever saw either of these letters. Teddy wrote both, and</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>keeps yours to crow over me with because I wouldn&rsquo;t tell him my secret.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have any secrets, Jo. Tell it to Mother and keep out of trouble, as I should have
            done,&rdquo; said Meg warningly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bless you, child! Mother told me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That will do, Jo. I&rsquo;ll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie. I shall sift the matter to the
            bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at once.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s real feelings. &ldquo;Now, dear, what are your
            own? Do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free
            for the present?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so scared and worried, I don&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with lovers for a
            long while&mdash;perhaps never,&rdquo; answered Meg petulantly. &ldquo;If John doesn&rsquo;t know anything
            about this nonsense, don&rsquo;t tell him, and make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues. I won&rsquo;t be
            deceived and plagued and made a fool of&mdash;it&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Seeing that Meg&rsquo;s usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke, Mrs.
            March soothed her by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the future. The instant
            Laurie&rsquo;s step was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received the culprit
            alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he wouldn&rsquo;t come, but he knew the minute he saw
            Mrs. March&rsquo;s face, and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once. Jo was
            dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might
            bolt. The sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened during that
            interview the girls never knew.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that Jo forgave him
            on the spot, but did not think it wise to betray the fact. Meg received his humble apology, and was much
            comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never tell him to my dying day&mdash;wild horses shan&rsquo;t drag it out of me; so
            you&rsquo;ll forgive me, Meg, and I&rsquo;ll do anything to show how out-and-out sorry I am,&rdquo; he
            added, looking very much ashamed of himself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do. I didn&rsquo;t think you could be so sly
            and malicious, Laurie,&rdquo; replied Meg, trying to hide her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful
            air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It was altogether abominable, and I don&rsquo;t deserve to be spoken to for a month, but you will,
            though, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; And Laurie folded his hands together with such an imploring gesture, as he
            spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him in spite of his
            scandalous behavior. Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March&rsquo;s grave face relaxed, in spite of her efforts to
            keep sober, when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase
            himself like a worm before the injured damsel.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and succeeding only in primming up her
            face into an expression of entire disapprobation. Laurie looked at her once or twice, but as she showed no
            sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till the others were done with him, when he
            made her a low bow and walked off without a word.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving, and when Meg and her mother went upstairs,
            she felt lonely and longed for Teddy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and armed with a book to return, went over to the
            big house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Laurence in?&rdquo; asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming downstairs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, miss, but I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s seeable just yet.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why not? Is he ill?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;La, no, miss, but he&rsquo;s had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of his tantrums about
            something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I dursn&rsquo;t go nigh him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where is Laurie?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Shut up in his room, and he won&rsquo;t answer, though I&rsquo;ve been a-tapping. I don&rsquo;t know
            what&rsquo;s to become of the dinner, for it&rsquo;s ready, and there&rsquo;s no one to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see what the matter is. I&rsquo;m not afraid of either of them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie&rsquo;s little study.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Stop that, or I&rsquo;ll open the door and make you!&rdquo; called out the young gentleman in a
            threatening tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo immediately knocked again; the door flew open, and in she bounced before Laurie could recover from his
            surprise. Seeing that he really was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite
            expression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly, &ldquo;Please forgive me for being so
            cross. I came to make it up, and can&rsquo;t go away till I have.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Get up, and don&rsquo;t be a goose, Jo,&rdquo; was the cavalier reply to her
            petition. &ldquo;Thank you, I will. Could I ask what&rsquo;s the matter? You don&rsquo;t look exactly easy
            in your mind.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been shaken, and I won&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo; growled Laurie
            indignantly. &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; demanded Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Grandfather. If it had been anyone else I&rsquo;d have&mdash;&rdquo; And the injured youth finished
            his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing. I often shake you, and you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Jo soothingly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Pooh! You&rsquo;re a girl, and it&rsquo;s fun, but I&rsquo;ll allow no man to shake me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as much like a thundercloud as you do
            now. Why were you treated so?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just because I wouldn&rsquo;t say what your mother wanted me for. I&rsquo;d promised not to tell, and
            of course I wasn&rsquo;t going to break my word.&rdquo; &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you satisfy your grandpa in
            any other way?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I&rsquo;d have told my part
            of the scrape, if I could without bringing Meg in. As I couldn&lsquo;t, I held my tongue, and bore the
            scolding till the old gentleman collared me. Then I got angry and bolted, for fear I should forget
            myself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t nice, but he&rsquo;s sorry, I know, so go down and make up. I&rsquo;ll help
            you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hanged if I do! I&rsquo;m not going to be lectured and pummelled by everyone, just for a bit of a
            frolic. I was sorry about Meg, and begged pardon like a man; but I won&rsquo;t do it again, when I
            wasn&rsquo;t in the wrong.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby. It&rsquo;s no use, Jo, he&rsquo;s got to learn
            that I&rsquo;m able to take care of myself, and don&rsquo;t need anyone&rsquo;s apron string to hold on
            by.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What pepper pots<u><sup>di</sup></u> you are!&rdquo; sighed Jo. &ldquo;How do you mean to settle this
            affair?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can&rsquo;t tell him what the fuss&rsquo;s
            about.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bless you! He won&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go down till he does.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, Teddy, be sensible. Let it pass, and I&rsquo;ll explain what I can. You can&rsquo;t stay here, so
            what&rsquo;s the use of being melodramatic?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to stay here long, anyway. I&rsquo;ll slip off and take a journey somewhere, and
            when Grandpa misses me he&rsquo;ll come round fast enough.&rdquo; &ldquo;I dare say, but you ought not to go
            and worry him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t preach. I&rsquo;ll go to Washington and see Brooke; it&rsquo;s gay there, and I&rsquo;ll
            enjoy myself after the troubles.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What fun you&rsquo;d have! I wish I could run off too,&rdquo; said Jo, forgetting her part of mentor
            in lively visions of martial life at the capital.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Come on, then! Why not? You go and surprise your father, and I&rsquo;ll stir up old Brooke. It would
            be a glorious joke; let&rsquo;s do it, Jo. We&rsquo;ll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot off
            at once. I&rsquo;ve got money enough; it will do you good, and be no harm, as you go to your father.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the plan was, it just suited her. She was tired of
            care and confinement, longed for change, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel charms
            of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun. Her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window, but
            they fell on the old house opposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If I was a boy, we&rsquo;d run away together, and have a capital time; but as I&rsquo;m a miserable
            girl, I must be proper and stop at home. Don&rsquo;t tempt me, Teddy, it&rsquo;s a crazy plan.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fun of it,&rdquo; began Laurie, who had got a willful fit on him and was possessed to
            break out of bounds in some way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; cried Jo, covering her ears. &ldquo; &lsquo;Prunes and
            prisms&rsquo;<u><sup>dj</sup></u> are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it. I came here to
            moralize, not to hear about things that make me skip to think of.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had more spirit,&rdquo; began Laurie
            insinuatingly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bad boy, be quiet! Sit down and think of your own sins, don&rsquo;t go making me add to mine. If I get
            your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?&rdquo; asked Jo seriously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, but you won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; answered Laurie, who wished to make up, but felt that his
            outraged dignity must be appeased first.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If I can manage the young one I can the old one,&rdquo; muttered Jo, as she walked away, leaving
            Laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; And Mr. Laurence&rsquo;s gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as Jo tapped at his
            door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me, sir, come to return a book,&rdquo; she said blandly, as she entered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Want any more?&rdquo; asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but trying not to show it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, please. I like old Sam so well, I think I&rsquo;ll try the second volume,&rdquo; returned Jo,
            hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second dose of Boswell&rsquo;s Johnson,<u><sup>dk</sup></u> as he
            had recommended that lively work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the Johnsonian literature
            was placed. Jo skipped up, and sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was
            really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect
            that something was brewing in her mind, for after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced round
            on her, speaking so abruptly that Rasselas<u><sup>dl</sup></u>tumbled face downward on the floor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What has that boy been about? Don&rsquo;t try to shield him. I know he has been in mischief by the way
            he acted when he came home. I can&rsquo;t get a word from him, and when I threatened to shake the truth out
            of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He did do wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a word to anyone,&rdquo; began Jo
            reluctantly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do; he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls. If
            he&rsquo;s done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg pardon, and be punished. Out with it, Jo, I
            won&rsquo;t be kept in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have gladly run away, if she could, but
            she was perched aloft on the steps, and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and
            brave it out.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir, I cannot tell. Mother forbade it. Laurie has confessed, asked pardon, and been punished
            quite enough. We don&rsquo;t keep silence to shield him, but someone else, and it will make more trouble if
            you interfere. Please don&rsquo;t; it was partly my fault, but it&rsquo;s all right now; so let&rsquo;s
            forget it, and talk about the Rambler<u><sup>dm</sup></u> or something pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hang the Rambler! Come down and give me your word that this harum-scarum boy of mine hasn&rsquo;t done
            anything ungrateful or impertinent. If he has, after all your kindness to him, I&rsquo;ll thrash him with my
            own hands.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a
            finger against his grandson, whatever he might say to the contrary. She obediently descended, and made as
            light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or forgetting the truth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hum&mdash;ha&mdash;well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and not from obstinacy,
            I&rsquo;ll forgive him. He&rsquo;s a stubborn fellow and hard to manage,&rdquo; said Mr. Laurence, rubbing
            up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with an
            air of relief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king&rsquo;s horses and all the king&rsquo;s men
            couldn&lsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jo, trying to say a kind word for her friend, who seemed to get out of one
            scrape only to fall into another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m not kind to him, hey?&rdquo; was the sharp answer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no, sir, you are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a trifle hasty when he tries your
            patience. Don&rsquo;t you think you are?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid, though she quaked a little after her
            bold speech. To her great relief and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the table
            with a rattle and exclaimed frankly&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, girl, I am! I love the boy, but he tries my patience past bearing, and I
            don&rsquo;t know how it will end, if we go on so.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, he&rsquo;ll run away.&rdquo; Jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made;
            she meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear much restraint, and hoped he would be more forbearing with
            the lad.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Laurence&rsquo;s ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a troubled glance at the picture of a
            handsome man, which hung over his table. It was Laurie&rsquo;s father, who had run away in his youth, and
            married against the imperious old man&rsquo;s will. Jo fancied he remembered and regretted the past, and she
            wished she had held her tongue.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens it sometimes, when he gets
            tired of studying. I often think I should like to, especially since my hair was cut, so if you ever miss us,
            you may advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for India.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently taking the whole as a joke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You hussy, how dare you talk in that way? Where&rsquo;s your respect for me, and your proper bringing
            up? Bless the boys and girls! What torments they are, yet we can&rsquo;t do without them,&rdquo; he said,
            pinching her cheeks good-humoredly. &ldquo;Go and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell him it&rsquo;s all
            right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather. I won&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come, sir; he feels badly because you didn&rsquo;t believe him when he said he
            couldn&rsquo;t tell. I think the shaking hurt his feelings very much.&rdquo; Jo tried to look pathetic but
            must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me, I suppose. What the dickens does
            the fellow expect?&rdquo; And the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If I were you, I&rsquo;d write him an apology, sir. He says he won&rsquo;t come down till he has one,
            and talks about Washington, and goes on in an absurd way. A formal apology will make him see how foolish he
            is, and bring him down quite amiable. Try it; he likes fun, and this way is better than talking. I&rsquo;ll
            carry it up, and teach him his duty.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying slowly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sly puss,
            but I don&rsquo;t mind being managed by you and Beth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done
            with this nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult.
            Jo dropped a kiss on the top of Mr. Laurence&rsquo;s bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under
            Laurie&rsquo;s door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive, decorous, and a few other agreeable
            impossibilities. Finding the door locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly
            away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for her at the bottom, saying, with his
            most virtuous expression of countenance, &ldquo;What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up?&rdquo;
            he added, laughing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, he was pretty mild, on the whole.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah! I got it all round. Even you cast me off over there, and I felt just ready to go to the
            deuce,&rdquo;<u><sup>dn</sup></u> he began apologetically.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk in that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again, Teddy, my son.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil my copybooks; and I make so many
            beginnings there never will be an end,&rdquo; he said dolefully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Go and eat your dinner, you&rsquo;ll feel better after it. Men always croak when they are
            hungry,&rdquo; and Jo whisked out at the front door after that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a &lsquo;label&rsquo; on my &lsquo;sect,&rsquo;&rdquo; answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as
            he went to partake of humble-pie dutifully with his grandfather, who was quite saintly in temper and
            overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, but the mischief was done, for though
            others forgot it Meg remembered. She never alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good deal,
            dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo, rummaging her sister&rsquo;s desk for stamps, found a bit of
            paper scribbled over with the words, &ldquo;Mrs. John Brooke,&rdquo; whereat she groaned tragically and cast
            it into the fire, feeling that Laurie&rsquo;s prank had hastened the evil day for her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>22</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pleasant Meadows</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like sunshine after storm were the peaceful weeks which fol lowed. The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr.
            March began to talk of returning early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day,
            amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time with doll&rsquo;s sewing, which had fallen
            sadly behindhand. Her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her a daily airing about the
            house in her strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for
            &ldquo;the dear,&rdquo; while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many
            of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house, and Jo frequently convulsed the family
            by proposing utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry
            Christmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches,
            if he had had his own way. After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered
            effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces, which were rather belied by explosions of laughter
            when the two got together.</p>
        <p>Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid Christmas Day. Hannah &ldquo;felt in her
            bones&rdquo; that it was going to be an unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for
            everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To begin with, Mr. March wrote that he
            should soon be with them, then Beth felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her
            mother&rsquo;s gift&mdash;a soft crimson merino wrapper &mdash;was borne in triumph to the window to behold
            the offering of Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name, for like
            elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise. Out in the garden stood a stately snow
            maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of new music in
            the other, a perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas carol issuing from her
            lips, on a pink paper streamer:</p>
        <p>THE JUNGFRAU<u><sup>do</sup></u> TO BETH</p>
        <p>God bless you, dear Queen Bess!</p>
        <p>May nothing you dismay,</p>
        <p>But health and peace and happiness</p>
        <p>Be yours, this Christmas Day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s fruit to feed our busy bee,</p>
        <p>And flowers for her nose;</p>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s music for her pianee,</p>
        <p>An Afghan for her toes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A portrait of Joanna, see,</p>
        <p>By Raphael No. 2,</p>
        <p>Who labored with great industry</p>
        <p>To make it fair and true.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Accept a ribbon red, I beg,</p>
        <p>For Madam Purrer&rsquo;s tail;</p>
        <p>And ice cream made by lovely Peg,&mdash;</p>
        <p>A Mont Blanc<u><sup>dp</sup></u> in a pail.</p>
        <p>Their dearest love my makers laid</p>
        <p>Within my breast of snow:</p>
        <p>Accept it, and the Alpine maid,</p>
        <p>From Laurie and from Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts, and what ridiculous
            speeches Jo made as she presented them!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so full of happiness, that, if Father was only here, I couldn&rsquo;t hold one drop
            more,&rdquo; said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo carried her off to the study to rest after the
            excitement, and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the &ldquo;Jungfrau&rdquo; had sent
            her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the long-desired Undine and Sintram.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I am,&rdquo; echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the Madonna and Child, which
            her mother had given her in a pretty frame.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course I am!&rdquo; cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first silk dress, for Mr.
            Laurence had insisted on giving it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How can I be otherwise?&rdquo; said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went from her husband&rsquo;s
            letter to Beth&rsquo;s smiling face, and her hand caressed the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and
            dark brown hair, which the girls had just fastened on her breast.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion, and what a
            comfort that is. Half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more,
            the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly. He might just as well have
            turned a somersault and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and
            his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless
            voice, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another Christmas present for the March family.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away somehow, and in his place appeared a tall
            man, muffled up to the eyes, leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and
            couldn&rsquo;t. Of course there was a general stampede, and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose
            their wits, for the strangest things were done, and no one said a word. Mr. March became invisible in the
            embrace of four pairs of loving arms; Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored
            by Laurie in the china closet; Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently
            explained; and Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and, never stopping to get up, hugged and cried
            over her father&rsquo;s boots in the most touching manner. Mrs. March was the first to recover herself, and
            held up her hand with a warning, &ldquo;Hush! Remember Beth!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But it was too late; the study door flew open, the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold&mdash;joy put
            strength into the feeble limbs&mdash;and Beth ran straight into her father&rsquo;s arms. Never mind what
            happened just after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the bitterness of the past and
            leaving only the sweetness of the present.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again, for Hannah was discovered behind
            the door, sobbing over the fat turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the
            kitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for his faithful care of her husband,
            at which Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and, seizing Laurie, he precipitately
            retired. Then the two invalids were ordered to repose, which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and
            talking hard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the fine weather came, he had been allowed
            by his doctor to take advantage of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most
            estimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute just there, and after a glance at Meg, who
            was violently poking the fire, looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you to
            imagine; also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked, rather abruptly, if he wouldn&rsquo;t have
            something to eat. Jo saw and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea,
            muttering to herself as she slammed the door, &ldquo;I hate estimable young men with brown eyes!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat turkey was a sight to behold, when
            Hannah sent him up, stuffed, browned, and decorated; so was the plum pudding, which quite melted in
            one&rsquo;s mouth; likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a honeypot. Everything turned
            out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said, &ldquo;For my mind was that flustered, mum, that it&rsquo;s a
            merrycle I didn&rsquo;t roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone
            bilin&lsquo;<u><sup>dq</sup></u> of it in a cloth.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke&mdash;at whom Jo glowered darkly, to
            Laurie&rsquo;s infinite amusement. Two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat
            Beth and her father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. They drank healths, told stories, sang
            songs, &ldquo;reminisced,&rdquo; as the old folks say, and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had
            been planned, but the girls would not leave their father; so the guests departed early, and as twilight
            gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected to have. Do you
            remember?&rdquo; asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Rather a pleasant year on the whole!&rdquo; said Meg, smiling at the fire, and congratulating herself
            on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s been a pretty hard one,&rdquo; observed Amy, watching the light shine on her ring
            with thoughtful eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s over, because we&rsquo;ve got you back,&rdquo; whispered Beth, who sat on
            her father&rsquo;s knee.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially the latter part of it. But you
            have got on bravely, and I think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,&rdquo; said Mr.
            March, looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How do you know? Did Mother tell you?&rdquo; asked Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not much. Straws show which way the wind blows, and I&rsquo;ve made several discoveries today.&rdquo;
            &ldquo;Oh, tell us what they are!&rdquo; cried Meg, who sat beside him.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here is one.&rdquo; And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair, he pointed to the
            roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and two or three little hard spots on the palm. &ldquo;I remember
            a time when this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so. It was very pretty then,
            but to me it is much prettier now&mdash;for in these seeming blemishes I read a little history. A burnt
            offering has been made of vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters; and
            I&rsquo;m sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time, so much goodwill went into
            the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or
            fashionable accomplishments. I&rsquo;m proud to shake this good, industrious little hand, and hope I shall
            not soon be asked to give it away.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it in the hearty pressure of her
            father&rsquo;s hand and the approving smile he gave her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What about Jo? Please say something nice, for she has tried so hard and been so very, very good to
            me,&rdquo; said Beth in her father&rsquo;s ear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an unusually mild expression in her
            brown face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;In spite of the curly crop, I don&rsquo;t see the &lsquo;son Jo&rsquo; whom I left a year ago,&rdquo;
            said Mr. March. &ldquo;I see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither
            whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do. Her face is rather thin and pale just now,
            with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for it has grown gentler, and her voice is lower; she
            doesn&rsquo;t bounce, but moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which
            delights me. I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman in her place, I
            shall feel quite satisfied. I don&rsquo;t know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know
            that in all Washington I couldn&rsquo;t find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty
            dollars which my good girl sent me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo&rsquo;s keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she
            received her father&rsquo;s praise, feeling that she did deserve a portion of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now Beth,&rdquo; said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so little of her, I&rsquo;m afraid to say much, for fear she will slip away altogether,
            though she is not so shy as she used to be,&rdquo; began their father cheerfully; but recollecting how
            nearly he had lost her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his own,
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you safe, my Beth, and I&rsquo;ll keep you so, please God.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After a minute&rsquo;s silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket at his feet, and said, with a
            caress of the shining hair&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her mother all the afternoon, gave Meg
            her place tonight, and has waited on every one with patience and good humor. I also observe that she does
            not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears; so I
            conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try and
            mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay figures. I am glad of this, for though I should
            be very proud of a graceful statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a
            talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of, Beth?&rdquo; asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her father and told about her
            ring.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I read in Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress today how, after many troubles, Christian and
            Hopeful<u><sup>dr</sup></u> came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all the year round, and
            there they rested happily, as we do now, before they went on to their journey&rsquo;s end,&rdquo; answered
            Beth, adding, as she slipped out of her father&rsquo;s arms and went slowly to the instrument,
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s singing time now, and I want to be in my old place. I&rsquo;ll try to sing the song of the
            shepherd boy which the Pilgrims<u><sup>ds</sup></u> heard. I made the music for Father, because he likes the
            verses.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and in the sweet voice they had never
            thought to hear again, sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song
            for her:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He that is down need fear no fall,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He that is low no pride;</p>
        <p>He that is humble ever shall</p>
        <p>Have God to be his guide.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am content with what I have,</p>
        <p>Little be it or much;</p>
        <p>And, Lord! contentment still I crave,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Because Thou savest such.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fulness to them a burden is,</p>
        <p>That go on pilgrimage;</p>
        <p>Here little, and hereafter bliss,</p>
        <p>Is best from age to age!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>23</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Aunt March Settles the Question</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered about Mr. March the next day, neglecting
            everything to look at, wait upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed by
            kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth&rsquo;s sofa, with the other three close by, and
            Hannah popping in her head now and then &ldquo;to peek at the dear man,&rdquo; nothing seemed needed to
            complete their happiness. But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it, though none confessed the
            fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg. Jo
            had sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s umbrella, which had been
            left in the hall; Meg was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when
            John&rsquo;s name was mentioned; Amy said, &ldquo;Everyone seemed waiting for something, and couldn&rsquo;t
            settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home,&rdquo; and Beth innocently wondered why their
            neighbors didn&rsquo;t run over as usual.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic
            fit, for he fell down upon one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands
            imploringly, as if begging some boon; and when Meg told him to behave himself and go away, he wrung
            imaginary tears out of his handkerchief, and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What does the goose mean?&rdquo; said Meg, laughing and trying to look unconscious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; answered
            Jo scornfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say my John, it isn&rsquo;t proper or true,&rdquo; but Meg&rsquo;s voice lingered over the
            words as if they sounded pleasant to her. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t plague me, Jo, I&rsquo;ve told you I
            don&rsquo;t care much about him, and there isn&rsquo;t to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly,
            and go on as before.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We can&lsquo;t, for something has been said, and Laurie&rsquo;s mischief has spoiled you for me. I see
            it, and so does Mother; you are not like your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I
            don&rsquo;t mean to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all settled. I hate to
            wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and have it over quickly,&rdquo; said Jo pettishly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say or do anything till he speaks, and he won&lsquo;t, because Father said I was too
            young,&rdquo; began Meg, bending over her work with a queer little smile, which suggested that she did not
            quite agree with her father on that point.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If he did speak, you wouldn&rsquo;t know what to say, but would cry or blush, or let him have his own
            way, instead of giving a good, decided, No.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I should say, for I&rsquo;ve planned it
            all, so I needn&rsquo;t be taken unawares; there&rsquo;s no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be
            prepared.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo couldn&rsquo;t help smiling at the important air which Meg had unconsciously assumed and which was as
            becoming as the pretty color varying in her cheeks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Would you mind telling me what you&rsquo;d say?&rdquo; asked Jo more respectfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not at all. You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confidante, and my experience will be
            useful to you by-and-by, perhaps, in your own affairs of this sort.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mean to have any; it&rsquo;s fun to watch other people philander, but I should feel like a
            fool doing it myself,&rdquo; said Jo, looking alarmed at the thought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you.&rdquo; Meg spoke as if to herself, and
            glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,&rdquo; said Jo, rudely shortening her
            sister&rsquo;s little reverie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, &lsquo;Thank you, Mr. Brooke, you are very kind,
            but I agree with Father that I am too young to enter into any engagement at present; so please say no more,
            but let us be friends as we were.&lsquo; &rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hum, that&rsquo;s stiff and cool enough! I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ll ever say it, and I know he
            won&rsquo;t be satisfied if you do. If he goes on like the rejected lovers in books, you&rsquo;ll give in,
            rather than hurt his feelings.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. I shall tell him I&rsquo;ve made up my mind, and shall walk out of the room with
            dignity.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified exit, when a step in the hall made her
            fly into her seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a
            given time. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when someone gave a modest tap, opened the door
            with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella&mdash;that is, to see how your father finds himself
            today,&rdquo; said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused as his eye went from one telltale face to the
            other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very well, he&rsquo;s in the rack, I&rsquo;ll get him, and tell it you are here.&rdquo; And
            having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give
            Meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity. But the instant she vanished, Meg began to sidle toward
            the door, murmuring&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I&rsquo;ll call her.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go. Are you afraid of me, Margaret?&rdquo; And Mr. Brooke looked so hurt that Meg thought
            she must have done something very rude. She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never
            called her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say
            it. Anxious to appear friendly and at her ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said
            gratefully&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish I could thank you for it.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you how?&rdquo; asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast in both his own, and
            looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed
            to run away and to stop and listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh no, please don&lsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; she said, trying to withdraw her hand,
            and looking frightened in spite of her denial.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t trouble you, I only want to know if you care for me a little, Meg. I love you so much,
            dear,&rdquo; added Mr. Brooke tenderly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn&rsquo;t make it; she forgot every word of it,
            hung her head, and answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; so softly that John had to stoop down to
            catch the foolish little reply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied, pressed the
            plump hand gratefully, and said in his most persuasive tone, &ldquo;Will you try and find out? I want to
            know so much, for I can&rsquo;t go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am to have my reward in
            the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>end or not.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too young,&rdquo; faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet rather enjoying it.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me. Would it be a very hard
            lesson, dear?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not if I chose to learn it, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Please choose to learn, Meg. I love to teach, and this is easier than German,&rdquo; broke in John,
            getting possession of the other hand, so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as
            tender, and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success. This nettled her. Annie
            Moffat&rsquo;s foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind, and the love of power, which sleeps in the
            bosoms of the best of little women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. She felt excited and
            strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said
            petulantly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t choose. Please go away and let me be!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears, for he had never seen
            Meg in such a mood before, and it rather bewildered him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you really mean that?&rdquo; he asked anxiously, following her as she walked away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. I don&rsquo;t want to be worried about such things. Father says I needn&lsquo;t, it&rsquo;s
            too soon and I&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I hope you&rsquo;ll change your mind by-and-by? I&rsquo;ll wait and say nothing till you
            have had more time. Don&rsquo;t play with me, Meg. I didn&rsquo;t think that of you.&rdquo;
            &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of me at all. I&rsquo;d rather you wouldn&lsquo;t,&rdquo; said Meg, taking a
            naughty satisfaction in trying her lover&rsquo;s patience and her own power.</p>
        <p>He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired, but he neither
            slapped his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did; he just stood looking at her so wistfully, so
            tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of her. What would have happened next I cannot say, if
            Aunt March had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old lady couldn&rsquo;t resist her longing to see her nephew, for she had met Laurie as she took her
            airing, and hearing of Mr. March&rsquo;s arrival, drove straight out to see him. The family were all busy in
            the back part of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to surprise them. She did surprise
            two of them so much that Meg started as if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bless me, what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; cried the old lady with a rap of her cane as she glanced from
            the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Father&rsquo;s friend. I&rsquo;m so surprised to see you!&rdquo; stammered Meg, feeling
            that she was in for a lecture now.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s evident,&rdquo; returned Aunt March, sitting down. &ldquo;But what is Father&rsquo;s
            friend saying to make you look like a peony? There&rsquo;s mischief going on, and I insist upon knowing what
            it is,&rdquo; with another rap.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We were merely talking. Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,&rdquo; began Meg, wishing that Mr. Brooke
            and the umbrella were safely out of the house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Brooke? That boy&rsquo;s tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all about it. Jo blundered into a wrong
            message in one of your father&rsquo;s letters, and I made her tell me. You haven&rsquo;t gone and accepted
            him, child?&rdquo; cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hush! He&rsquo;ll hear. Shan&rsquo;t I call Mother?&rdquo; said Meg, much troubled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not yet. I&rsquo;ve something to say to you, and I must free my mind at once. Tell me, do you mean to
            marry this Cook? If you do, not one penny of my money ever goes to you. Remember that, and be a sensible
            girl,&rdquo; said the old lady impressively.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people,
            and enjoyed doing it. The best of us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and in
            love. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would probably have declared she
            couldn&rsquo;t think of it; but as she was peremptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her
            mind that she would. Inclination as well as perversity made the decision easy, and being already much
            excited, Meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money to anyone you like,&rdquo; she
            said, nodding her head with a resolute air. &ldquo;Highty-tighty! Is that the way you take my advice, miss?
            You&rsquo;ll be sorry for it by-and-by, when you&rsquo;ve tried love in a cottage and found it a
            failure.&rdquo; &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be a worse one than some people find in big houses,&rdquo; retorted
            Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for she did not know her in this new mood. Meg
            hardly knew herself, she felt so brave and independent&mdash;so glad to defend John and assert her right to
            love him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and after a little pause, made a fresh
            start, saying as mildly as she could, &ldquo;Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice. I mean it
            kindly, and don&rsquo;t want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning. You ought to
            marry well and help your family; it&rsquo;s your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon
            you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Father and Mother don&rsquo;t think so, they like John though he is poor.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than two babies.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; cried Meg stoutly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. &ldquo;This Rook is poor and hasn&rsquo;t got any
            rich relations, has he?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, but he has many warm friends.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t live on friends, try it and see how cool they&rsquo;ll grow. He hasn&rsquo;t any
            business, has he?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not yet. Mr. Laurence is going to help him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t last long. James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow and not to be depended on. So you
            intend to marry a man without money, position, or business, and go on working harder than you do now, when
            you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better? I thought you had more sense,
            Meg.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do better if I waited half my life! John is good and wise, he&rsquo;s got heaps of
            talent, he&rsquo;s willing to work and sure to get on, he&rsquo;s so energetic and brave. Everyone likes and
            respects him, and I&rsquo;m proud to think he cares for me, though I&rsquo;m so poor and young and
            silly,&rdquo; said Meg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He knows you have got rich relations, child; that&rsquo;s the secret of his liking, I suspect.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing? John is above such meanness, and I won&rsquo;t listen to
            you a minute if you talk so,&rdquo; cried Meg indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the
            old lady&rsquo;s suspicions. &ldquo;My John wouldn&rsquo;t marry for money, any more than I would. We are
            willing to work, and we mean to wait. I&rsquo;m not afraid of being poor, for I&rsquo;ve been happy so far,
            and I know I shall be with him because he loves me, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn&rsquo;t made up her mind, that she had told
            &ldquo;her John&rdquo; to go away, and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her pretty niece make a fine match, and
            something in the girl&rsquo;s happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair! You are a willful child, and you&rsquo;ve lost more than
            you know by this piece of folly. No, I won&rsquo;t stop. I&rsquo;m disappointed in you, and haven&rsquo;t
            spirits to see your father now. Don&rsquo;t expect anything from me when you are married; your Mr.
            Brooke&rsquo;s friends must take care of you. I&rsquo;m done with you forever.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And slamming the door in Meg&rsquo;s face, Aunt March drove off in high dudgeon. She seemed to take all the
            girl&rsquo;s courage with her, for when left alone, Meg stood a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry.
            Before she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr. Brooke, who said all in one breath,
            &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help hearing, Meg. Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you
            do care for me a little bit.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how much till she abused you,&rdquo; began Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And I needn&rsquo;t go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing
            either, and disgraced herself forever in Jo&rsquo;s eyes by meekly whispering, &ldquo;Yes, John,&rdquo; and
            hiding her face on Mr. Brooke&rsquo;s waistcoat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fifteen minutes after Aunt March&rsquo;s departure, Jo came softly downstairs, paused an instant at the
            parlor door, and hearing no sound within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying to herself,
            &ldquo;She has seen him away as we planned, and that affair is settled. I&rsquo;ll go and hear the fun, and
            have a good laugh over it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her
            there, staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes. Going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to
            praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to
            behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strong-minded sister enthroned upon his
            knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower
            bath had suddenly fallen upon her&mdash;for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her
            breath away. At the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her. Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but
            &ldquo;that man,&rdquo; as Jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the astonished
            newcomer, &ldquo;Sister Jo, congratulate us!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was adding insult to injury&mdash;it was altogether too much&mdash;and making some wild demonstration
            with her hands, Jo vanished without a word. Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming
            tragically as she burst into the room, &ldquo;Oh, do somebody go down quick; John Brooke is acting
            dreadfully, and Meg likes it!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed; and casting herself upon the bed, Jo cried and scolded
            tempestuously as she told the awful news to Beth and Amy. The little girls, however, considered it a most
            agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them; so she went up to her refuge in the
            garret, and confided her troubles to the rats.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon; but a great deal of talking was done, and quiet
            Mr. Brooke astonished his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his
            plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for Meg, and he
            proudly took her in to supper, both looking so happy that Jo hadn&rsquo;t the heart to be jealous or dismal.
            Amy was very much impressed by John&rsquo;s devotion and Meg&rsquo;s dignity, Beth beamed at them from a
            distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was
            perfectly evident Aunt March was right in calling them as &ldquo;unworldly as a pair of babies.&rdquo; No
            one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the
            first romance of the family began there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?&rdquo; said Amy, trying to decide
            how she would group the lovers in the sketch she was planning to make.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t. How much has happened since I said that! It seems a year ago,&rdquo;
            answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such common things as bread and butter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the changes have begun,&rdquo; said
            Mrs. March. &ldquo;In most families there comes, now and then, a year full of events; this has been such a
            one, but it ends well, after all.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hope the next will end better,&rdquo; muttered Jo, who found it very hard to see Meg absorbed in a
            stranger before her face, for Jo loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or
            lessened in any way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hope the third year from this will end better. I mean it shall, if I live to work out my
            plans,&rdquo; said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if everything had become possible to him now.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem very long to wait?&rdquo; asked Amy, who was in a hurry for the wedding.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short time to me,&rdquo; answered
            Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face never seen there before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You have only to wait, I am to do the work,&rdquo; said John, beginning his labors by picking up
            Meg&rsquo;s napkin, with an expression which caused Jo to shake her head, and then say to herself with an
            air of relief as the front door banged, &ldquo;Here comes Laurie. Now we shall have a little sensible
            conversation.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking
            bouquet for &ldquo;Mrs. John Brooke,&rdquo; and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair
            had been brought about by his excellent management.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does; for when he makes up his mind to
            accomplish anything, it&rsquo;s done though the sky falls,&rdquo; said Laurie, when he had presented his
            offering and his congratulations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Much obliged for that recommendation. I take it as a good omen for the future and invite you to my
            wedding on the spot,&rdquo; answered Mr. Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous
            pupil.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come if I&rsquo;m at the ends of the earth, for the sight of Jo&rsquo;s face alone on that
            occasion would be worth a long journey. You don&rsquo;t look festive, ma&lsquo;am, what&rsquo;s the
            matter?&rdquo; asked Laurie, following her into a corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet
            Mr. Laurence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t approve of the match, but I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to bear it, and shall not say a
            word against it,&rdquo; said Jo solemnly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t know how hard it is for me to give up
            Meg,&rdquo; she continued with a little quiver in her voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t give her up. You only go halves,&rdquo; said Laurie consolingly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It never can be the same again. I&rsquo;ve lost my dearest friend,&rdquo; sighed Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me, anyhow. I&rsquo;m not good for much, I know, but I&rsquo;ll stand by you, Jo, all
            the days of my life. Upon my word I will!&rdquo; And Laurie meant what he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know you will, and I&rsquo;m ever so much obliged. You are always a great comfort to me,
            Teddy,&rdquo; returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, now, don&rsquo;t be dismal, there&rsquo;s a good fellow. It&rsquo;s all right, you see. Meg is
            happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately, Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very
            jolly to see Meg in her own little house. We&rsquo;ll have capital times after she is gone, for I shall be
            through college before long,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and then we&rsquo;ll go abroad on some nice trip or other. Wouldn&rsquo;t that console you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I rather think it would, but there&rsquo;s no knowing what may happen in three years,&rdquo; said Jo
            thoughtfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Don&rsquo;t you wish you could take a look forward and see where we shall all be
            then? I do,&rdquo; returned Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks so happy now, I don&rsquo;t believe
            they could be much improved.&rdquo; And Jo&rsquo;s eyes went slowly round the room, brightening as they
            looked, for the prospect was a pleasant one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some
            twenty years ago. Amy was drawing the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light of
            which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy. Beth lay on her sofa, talking
            cheerily with her old friend, who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead him
            along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low seat, with the grave, quiet look which
            best became her, and Laurie, leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly head,
            smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So grouped, the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever rises again, depends upon the
            reception given to the first act of the domestic drama called Little Women.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Part Two<u>7</u></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gossip</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg&rsquo;s wedding with free minds, it will be well to begin
            with a little gossip about the Marches. And here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too
            much &ldquo;lovering&rdquo; in the story, as I fear they may (I&rsquo;m not afraid the young folks will make
            that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March &ldquo;What can you expect when I have four gay girls in the
            house, and a dashing young neighbor over the way?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family. The war is over, and Mr.
            March safely at home, busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by
            grace&mdash;a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better than learning, the charity which calls
            all mankind &ldquo;brother,&rdquo; the piety that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which shut him out from the more worldly
            successes, attracted to him many admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as naturally
            he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had distilled no bitter drop. Earnest young
            men found the gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they, thoughtful or troubled women instinctively
            brought their doubts to him, sure of finding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel; sinners told their
            sins to the pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and saved; gifted men found a companion in him;
            ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own; and even worldlings confessed that his
            beliefs were beautiful and true, although &ldquo;they wouldn&rsquo;t pay.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so they did in many things; but the quiet
            scholar, sitting among his books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience, anchor, and
            comforter, for to him the busy, anxious women always turned in troublous times, finding him, in the truest
            sense of those sacred words, husband and father.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The girls gave their hearts into their mother&rsquo;s keeping, their souls into their father&rsquo;s; and to
            both parents, who lived and labored so faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth and
            bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we saw her last, and just now so absorbed
            in Meg&rsquo;s affairs that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded &ldquo;boys&rdquo; and
            soldiers&rsquo; widows, decidedly miss the motherly missionary&rsquo;s visits.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent home, and not allowed to return. He
            received no stars or bars, but he deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life and love are
            very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to his discharge, he devoted himself to
            getting well, preparing for business, and earning a home for Meg. With the good sense and sturdy
            independence that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence&rsquo;s more generous offers, and accepted the
            place of bookkeeper, feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any
            risks with borrowed money.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly in character, wise in housewifely arts,
            and prettier than ever, for love is a great beautifier. She had her girlish ambitions and hopes, and felt
            some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin. Ned Moffat had just married Sallie
            Gardiner, and Meg couldn&rsquo;t help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid
            outfit with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. But somehow envy and discontent soon
            vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her,
            and when they sat together in the twilight, talking over their small plans, the future always grew so
            beautiful and bright that she forgot Sallie&rsquo;s splendor, and felt herself the richest, happiest girl in
            Christendom.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to Amy that she bribed her with the
            offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going; and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would
            have served a far harder mistress. So she gave her mornings to duty, her afternoons to pleasure, and
            prospered finely. Jo meantime devoted herself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the
            fever was a thing of the past. Not an invalid exactly, but never again the rosy, healthy creature she had
            been, yet always hopeful, happy, and serene, busy with the quiet duties she loved, everyone&rsquo;s friend,
            and an angel in the house, long before those who loved her most had learned to know it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As long as The Spread Eagle paid her a dollar a column for her &ldquo;rubbish,&rdquo; as she called it, Jo
            felt herself a woman of means, and spun her little romances diligently. But great plans fermented in her
            busy brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of
            blotted manuscript, which was one day to place the name of March upon the roll of fame.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was now getting through it in the easiest
            possible manner to please himself. A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent, and the
            kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them, he stood in
            great danger of being spoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy, if he had not
            possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success, the
            motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any means, the
            knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him with all their hearts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Being only &ldquo;a glorious human boy,&rdquo; of course he frolicked and flirted, grew dandified, aquatic,
            sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions ordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than
            once came perilously near suspension and expulsion. But as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes
            of these pranks, he always managed to save himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the
            irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. In fact, he rather prided himself on his
            narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors,
            dignified professors, and vanquished enemies. The &ldquo;men of my class&rdquo; were heroes in the eyes of
            the girls, who never wearied of the exploits of &ldquo;our fellows,&rdquo; and were frequently allowed to
            bask in the smiles of these great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among them, for her ladyship early felt and
            learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed. Meg was too much absorbed in her private
            and particular John to care for any other lords of creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them
            and wonder how Amy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite in her element, and found it very
            difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural
            to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies. They all liked Jo immensely, but never fell in love
            with her, though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy&rsquo;s
            shrine. And speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the &ldquo;Dovecote.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was the name of the little brown house which Mr. Brooke had prepared for Meg&rsquo;s first home. Laurie
            had christened it, saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who &ldquo;went on together like a
            pair of turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo.&rdquo; It was a tiny house, with a little garden
            behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in front. Here Meg meant to have a fountain,
            shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers; though just at present the fountain was represented by a
            weather-beaten urn, very like a dilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,
            undecided whether to live or die, and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to
            show where seeds were planted. But inside, it</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar. To be sure, the hall was so
            narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in whole, the dining room
            was so small that six people were a tight fit, and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose
            of precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coalbin. But once get used to these slight
            blemishes and nothing could be more complete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the
            furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory. There were no marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or
            lace curtains in the little parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a stand of
            flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and
            were the fairer for the loving messages they brought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t think the Parian Psyche<u><sup>dt</sup></u> Laurie gave lost any of its beauty because John put
            up the bracket it stood upon, that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more
            gracefully than Amy&rsquo;s artistic hand, or that any storeroom was ever better provided with good wishes,
            merry words, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her mother put away Meg&rsquo;s few boxes, barrels,
            and bundles; and I am morally certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat
            if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over, and laid the fire all ready for lighting,
            the minute &ldquo;Mis. Brooke came home.&rdquo; I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so
            rich a supply of dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came
            round, and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>People who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose, for the homeliest tasks get
            beautified if loving hands do them, and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest,
            from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was eloquent of home love and tender
            forethought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping excursions, what funny mistakes they made,
            and what shouts of laughter arose over Laurie&rsquo;s ridiculous bargains. In his love of jokes, this young
            gentleman, though nearly through college, was as much of a boy as ever. His last whim had been to bring with
            him on his weekly visits some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. Now a bag of
            remarkable clothespins, next, a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at the first trial, a knife
            cleaner that spoiled all the knives, or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the
            dirt, labor-saving soap that took the skin off one&rsquo;s hands, infallible cements which stuck firmly to
            nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer, and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for odd
            pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with every prospect of exploding
            in the process.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In vain Meg begged him to stop. John laughed at him, and Jo called him &ldquo;Mr.
            Toodles.&rdquo;<u><sup>du</sup></u> He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee ingenuity, and
            seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week beheld some fresh absurdity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everything was done at last, even to Amy&rsquo;s arranging different colored soaps to match the different
            colored rooms, and Beth&rsquo;s setting the table for the first meal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you should be happy here?&rdquo;
            asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then they seemed
            to cling together more tenderly than ever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and so happy that I can&rsquo;t talk about
            it,&rdquo; answered Meg, with a look that was better than words.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If she only had a servant or two it would be all right,&rdquo; said Amy, coming out of the parlor,
            where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze Mercury<u><sup>dv</sup></u> looked best on the
            whatnot<u><sup>dw</sup></u> or the mantelpiece.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try her way first. There will be so
            little to do that with Lotty to run my errands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to
            keep me from getting lazy or homesick,&rdquo; answered Meg tranquilly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Sallie Moffat has four,&rdquo; began Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If Meg had four the house wouldn&rsquo;t hold them, and master and missis would have to camp in the
            garden,&rdquo; broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big blue pinafore,<u><sup>dx</sup></u> was giving the last
            polish to the door handles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Sallie isn&rsquo;t a poor man&rsquo;s wife, and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment.
            Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little
            house as in the big one. It&rsquo;s a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave themselves nothing to
            do but dress, give orders, and gossip. When I was first married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear
            out or get torn, so that I might have the pleasure of mending them, for I got heartily sick of doing
            fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she does to amuse herself,
            though they never turn out well and the servants laugh at her,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I did after a while, not to &lsquo;mess,&rsquo; but to learn of Hannah how things should be done, that
            my servants need not laugh at me. It was play then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I
            not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls, and help myself when I
            could no longer afford to hire help. You begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons you learn now
            will be of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer man, for the mistress of a house, however splendid,
            should know how work ought to be done, if she wishes to be well and honestly served.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother, I&rsquo;m sure of that,&rdquo; said Meg, listening respectfully to the little lecture,
            for the best of women will hold forth upon the all-absorbing subject of housekeeping. &ldquo;Do you know I
            like this room most of all in my baby house,&rdquo; added Meg, a minute after, as they went upstairs and she
            looked into her well-stored linen closet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and exulting over the goodly array. All three
            laughed as Meg spoke, for that linen closet was a joke. You see, having said that if Meg married &ldquo;that
            Brooke&rdquo; she shouldn&rsquo;t have a cent of her money, Aunt March was rather in a quandary when time
            had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow. She never broke her word, and was much exercised in her
            mind how to get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself. Mrs. Carrol,
            Florence&rsquo;s mamma, was ordered to buy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table
            linen, and send it as her present, all of which was faithfully done; but the secret leaked out, and was
            greatly enjoyed by the family, for Aunt March tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could
            give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first bride.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a housewifely taste which I am glad to see. I had a young friend who set up housekeeping
            with six sheets, but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her,&rdquo; said Mrs. March,
            patting the damask<u><sup>dy</sup></u> tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will last me all my days, Hannah
            says.&rdquo; And Meg looked quite contented, as well she might.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Toodles is coming,&rdquo; cried Jo from below, and they all went down to meet Laurie, whose weekly
            visit was an important event in their quiet lives.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt basin of a hat, and a flyaway
            coat<u><sup>dz</sup></u> came tramping down the road at a great pace, walked over the low fence without
            stopping to open the gate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and a hearty&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here I am, Mother! Yes, it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him, a kindly questioning look which the
            handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker&rsquo;s congratulations and compliments. Bless you, Beth! What a
            refreshing spectacle you are, Jo. Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown-paper parcel to Meg, pulled Beth&rsquo;s hair ribbon, stared at
            Jo&rsquo;s big pinafore, and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round,
            and everyone began to talk.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where is John?&rdquo; asked Meg anxiously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma&lsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Which side won the last match, Teddy?&rdquo; inquired Jo, who persisted in feeling an interest in
            manly sports despite her nineteen years. &ldquo;Ours, of course. Wish you&rsquo;d been there to see.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;How is the lovely Miss Randal?&rdquo; asked Amy with a significant smile.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;More cruel than ever; don&rsquo;t you see how I&rsquo;m pining away?&rdquo; And Laurie gave his broad
            chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the last joke? Undo the bundle and see, Meg,&rdquo; said Beth, eying the knobby parcel
            with curiosity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves,&rdquo; observed Laurie, as
            a watchman&rsquo;s rattle appeared, amid the laughter of the girls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just swing that out of the front window,
            and it will rouse the neighborhood in a jiffy. Nice thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And Laurie gave them a
            sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s gratitude for you! And speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank
            Hannah for saving your wedding cake from destruction. I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if
            she hadn&rsquo;t defended it manfully I&rsquo;d have had a pick at it, for it looked like a remarkably
            plummy one.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie,&rdquo; said Meg in a matronly tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing my best, ma&lsquo;am, but can&rsquo;t get much higher, I&rsquo;m afraid, as six feet
            is about all men can do in these degenerate days,&rdquo; responded the young gentleman, whose head was about
            level with the little chandelier.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick and-span new bower, so as I&rsquo;m
            tremendously hungry, I propose an adjournment,&rdquo; he added presently.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mother and I are going to wait for John. There are some last things to settle,&rdquo; said Meg,
            bustling away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant&rsquo;s to get more flowers for tomorrow,&rdquo; added Amy,
            tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Come, Jo, don&rsquo;t desert a fellow. I&rsquo;m in such a state of exhaustion I can&rsquo;t get home
            without help. Don&rsquo;t take off your apron, whatever you do; it&rsquo;s peculiarly becoming,&rdquo; said
            Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered him her arm to support his
            feeble steps.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,&rdquo; began Jo, as they strolled away
            together. &ldquo;You must promise to behave well, and not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a prank.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t say funny things when we ought to be sober.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I never do. You are the one for that.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony. I shall certainly laugh if you do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see me, you&rsquo;ll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will obscure the
            prospect.&rdquo; &ldquo;I never cry unless for some great affliction.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Such as fellows going to college, hey?&rdquo; cut in Laurie, with a suggestive laugh.
            &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a peacock. I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls com pany.&rdquo; &ldquo;Exactly. I
            say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week? Pretty amiable?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Very. Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he&rsquo;ll take it?&rdquo; asked Jo rather
            sharply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, Jo, do you think I&rsquo;d look your mother in the face, and say &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; if it
            wasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; And Laurie stopped short, with an injured air. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t go and be suspicious. I only want some money,&rdquo; said Laurie, walking on again,
            appeased by her hearty tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You spend a great deal, Teddy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bless you, I don&rsquo;t spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is gone before I know it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are so generous and kindhearted that you let people borrow, and can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;No&rsquo;
            to anyone. We heard about Henshaw and all you did for him. If you always spent money in that way, no one
            would blame you,&rdquo; said Jo warmly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill. You wouldn&rsquo;t have me let that fine fellow work himself
            to death just for the want of a little help, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course not, but I don&rsquo;t see the use of your having seventeen waistcoats, endless neckties,
            and a new hat every time you come home. I thought you&rsquo;d got over the dandy period, but every now and
            then it breaks out in a new spot. Just now it&rsquo;s the fashion to be hideous&mdash;to make your head look
            like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket, orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots. If it was cheap
            ugliness, I&rsquo;d say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I don&rsquo;t get any satisfaction
            out of it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack, that the felt basin fell off, and Jo
            walked on it, which insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a
            rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, and stuffed it into his pocket.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lecture any more, there&rsquo;s a good soul! I have enough all through the week, and like
            to enjoy myself when I come home. I&rsquo;ll get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a
            satisfaction to my friends.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you in peace if you&rsquo;ll only let your hair grow. I&rsquo;m not aristocratic, but
            I do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young prize fighter,&rdquo; observed Jo severely.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;This unassuming style promotes study, that&rsquo;s why we adopt it,&rdquo; returned Laurie, who
            certainly could not be accused of vanity, having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand
            for quarter-of-an-inch-long stubble.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate about Amy. He talks of her
            constantly, writes poetry, and moons about in a most suspicious manner. He&rsquo;d better nip his little
            passion in the bud, hadn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; added Laurie, in a confidential, elder-brotherly tone, after a
            minute&rsquo;s silence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course he had. We don&rsquo;t want any more marrying in this family for years to come. Mercy on us,
            what are the children thinking of?&rdquo; And Jo looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were
            not yet in their teens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fast age, and I don&rsquo;t know what we are coming to, ma&lsquo;am. You are a mere
            infant, but you&rsquo;ll go next, Jo, and we&rsquo;ll be left lamenting,&rdquo; said Laurie,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed. I&rsquo;m not one of the agreeable sort. Nobody will want me, and it&rsquo;s a
            mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a family.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t give anyone a chance,&rdquo; said Laurie, with a sidelong glance and a little more
            color than before in his sunburned face. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t show the soft side of your character, and if
            a fellow gets a peep at it by accident and can&rsquo;t help showing that he likes it, you treat him as Mrs.
            Gummidge did her sweetheart&mdash;throw cold water over him<u><sup>ea</sup></u>&mdash;and get so thorny no
            one dares touch or look at you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that sort of thing, I&rsquo;m too busy to be worried with nonsense, and I think
            it&rsquo;s dreadful to break up families so. Now don&rsquo;t say any more about it. Meg&rsquo;s wedding has
            turned all our heads, and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities. I don&rsquo;t wish to get
            cross, so let&rsquo;s change the subject.&rdquo; And Jo looked quite ready to fling cold water on the
            slightest provocation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in a long low whistle and the fearful
            prediction as they parted at the gate, &ldquo;Mark my words, Jo, you&rsquo;ll go next.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>25</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The First Wedding</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in
            the cloudless sunshine, like friendly little neighbors, as they were. Quite flushed with excitement were
            their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind, whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped
            in at the dining-room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as
            they dressed the bride, others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden,
            porch, and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest baby bud, offered their tribute
            of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom
            into her face that day, making it fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk,
            lace, nor orange flowers would she have. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to look strange or fixed up today,&rdquo;
            she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a fashionable wedding, but only those about me whom I love, and to them
            I wish to look and be my familiar self.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes and innocent romances of a girlish
            heart. Her sisters braided up her pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the
            valley, which &ldquo;her John&rdquo; liked best of all the flowers that grew.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely that I should hug you if it
            wouldn&rsquo;t crumple your dress,&rdquo; cried Amy, surveying her with delight when all was done.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then I am satisfied. But please hug and kiss me, everyone, and don&rsquo;t mind my dress, I want a
            great many crumples of this sort put into it today.&rdquo; And Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung
            about her with April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not changed the old.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to tie John&rsquo;s cravat for him, and then to stay a few minutes with Father
            quietly in the study.&rdquo; And Meg ran down to perform these little ceremonies, and then to follow her
            mother wherever she went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there was a secret
            sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their simple toilet, it may be a good time to
            tell of a few changes which three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their best
            just now.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo&rsquo;s angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself with ease, if not grace. The curly crop
            has lengthened into a thick coil, more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. There is a fresh
            color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever; the beautiful, kind eyes are larger, and in them lies
            an expression that saddens one, although it is not sad itself. It is the shadow of pain which touches the
            young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of
            &ldquo;being better soon.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy is with truth considered &ldquo;the flower of the family,&rdquo; for at sixteen she has the air and
            bearing of a full-grown woman&mdash;not beautiful, but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace.
            One saw it in the lines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her dress, the droop of
            her hair &mdash;unconscious yet harmonious, and as attractive to many as beauty itself. Amy&rsquo;s nose
            still afflicted her, for it never would grow Grecian, so did her mouth, being too wide, and having a decided
            chin. These offending features gave character to her whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled
            herself with her wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and abundant than ever.
        </p>
        <p>All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the summer), with blush roses in hair and
            bosom; and all three looked just what they were &mdash;fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in
            their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as natural and homelike as possible, so
            when Aunt March arrived, she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in, to
            find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and to catch a glimpse of the paternal
            minister marching upstairs with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Upon my word, here&rsquo;s a state of things!&rdquo; cried the old lady. taking the seat of honor
            prepared for her, and settling the folds of her lavender moir&eacute;<u><sup>eb</sup></u> with a great
            rustle. &ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to be seen till the last minute, child. &rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a show. Aunty. and no one is coming to stare at me. to criticize my dress, or count the
            cost of my luncheon. I&rsquo;m too happy to care what anyone says or thinks, and I&rsquo;m going to have my
            little wedding just as I like it. John, dear, here&rsquo;s your hammer.&rdquo; And away went Meg to help
            &ldquo;that man&rdquo; in his highly improper employment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Brooke didn&rsquo;t even say, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; but as he stooped for the unromantic tool, he
            kissed his little bride behind the folding door, with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket
            handkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous exclamation, &ldquo;Jupiter Ammon!
            <u><sup>ec</sup></u> Jo&rsquo;s upset the cake again!&rdquo; caused a momentary flurry, which was hardly
            over when a flock of cousins arrived, and &ldquo;the party came in,&rdquo; as Beth used to say when a child.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than mosquitoes,&rdquo; whispered
            the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled and Laurie&rsquo;s black head towered above the rest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly elegant if he likes,&rdquo; returned
            Amy, gliding away to warn Hercules<u><sup>ed</sup></u> to beware of the dragon, which warning caused him to
            haunt the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room as Mr. March and the young pair took
            their places under the green arch. Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to give Meg up; the
            fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn; the
            bridegroom&rsquo;s hand trembled visibly, and no one heard his replies; but Meg looked straight up in her
            husband&rsquo;s eyes, and said, &ldquo;I will!&rdquo; with such tender trust in her own face and voice that
            her mother&rsquo;s heart rejoiced and Aunt March sniffed audibly.</p>
        <p>Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved from a demonstration by the
            consciousness that Laurie was staring fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his
            wicked black eyes. Beth kept her face hidden on her mother&rsquo;s shoulder, but Amy stood like a graceful
            statue, with a most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It wasn&rsquo;t at all the thing, I&rsquo;m afraid, but the minute she was fairly married, Meg cried,
            &ldquo;The first kiss for Marmee!&rdquo; and, turning, gave it with her heart on her lips. During the next
            fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves of their privileges
            to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who, adorned with a headdress fearfully and
            wonderfully made, fell upon her in the hall, crying with a sob and a chuckle,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bless you, deary, a hundred times! The cake ain&rsquo;t hurt a mite, and everything looks
            lovely.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried to, which did just as well, for
            laughter is ready when hearts are light. There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the little
            house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers.
            Mr. Laurence and Aunt March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and coffee were found
            to be the only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes<u><sup>ee</sup></u> carried round. No one said
            anything, however, till Laurie, who insisted on serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver
            in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;or am I merely laboring under
            a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this morning?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March actually sent some, but Father put
            away a little for Beth, and dispatched the rest to the Soldiers&rsquo; Home. You know he thinks that wine
            should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any
            young man under her roof.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he did neither, for after a quick look at
            her, he said, in his impetuous way, &ldquo;I like that! For I&rsquo;ve seen enough harm done to wish other
            women would think as you do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are not made wise by experience, I hope?&rdquo; And there was an anxious accent in Meg&rsquo;s
            voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I give you my word for it. Don&rsquo;t think too well of me, either, this is not one of my
            temptations. Being brought up where wine is as common as water and almost as harmless, I don&rsquo;t care
            for it, but when a pretty girl offers it, one doesn&rsquo;t like to refuse, you see.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come, Laurie, promise, and give me one more
            reason to call this the happiest day of my life.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment, for ridicule is often harder to bear
            than self-denial. Meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and feeling her power,
            used it as a woman may for her friend&rsquo;s good. She did not speak, but she looked up at him with a face
            made very eloquent by happiness, and a smile which said, &ldquo;No one can refuse me anything today.&rdquo;
            Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave her his hand, saying heartily, &ldquo;I
            promise, Mrs. Brooke!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thank you, very, very much.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And I drink &lsquo;long life to your resolution,&rsquo; Teddy,&rdquo; cried Jo, baptizing him with a
            splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and beamed approvingly upon him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of many temptations, for with instinctive
            wisdom, the girls had seized a happy moment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked them all his
            life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through house and garden, enjoying the sunshine
            without and within. Meg and John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grassplot, when
            Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband and wife, as the Germans do,
            while we bachelors and spinsters prance in couples outside!&rdquo; cried Laurie, promenading down the path
            with Amy, with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their example without a murmur.
            Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a
            moment&rsquo;s hesitation, threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into the ring. But the crowning joke
            was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for when the stately old gentleman chass&eacute;d<u><sup>ef</sup></u>
            solemnly up to the old lady, she just tucked her cane under arm, and hopped briskly away to join hands with
            the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a
            midsummer day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people began to go.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well; but I think you&rsquo;ll be sorry for it,&rdquo;
            said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as he led her to the carriage, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a
            treasure, young man, see that you deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That is the prettiest wedding I&rsquo;ve been to for an age, Ned, and I don&rsquo;t see why, for there
            wasn&rsquo;t a bit of style about it,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get one of those little girls to
            help you, and I shall be perfectly satisfied,&rdquo; said Mr.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurence, settling himself in his easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best to gratify you, sir,&rdquo; was Laurie&rsquo;s unusually dutiful reply, as he
            carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his buttonhole.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had was the quiet walk with John from the
            old home to the new. When she came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and straw
            bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say good-by, as tenderly as if she had been going to
            make the grand tour.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love you any the less for loving
            John so much,&rdquo; she said, clinging to her mother, with full eyes for a moment. &ldquo;I shall come
            every day, Father, and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I am married. Beth is going to
            be with me a great deal, and the other girls will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping
            struggles. Thank you all for my happy wedding day. Good-by, good-by!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender pride as she walked away, leaning on her
            husband&rsquo;s arm, with her hands full of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her happy
            face&mdash;and so Meg&rsquo;s married life began.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>26</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Artistic Attempts</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and genius, especially ambitious young men
            and women. Amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for
            inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity. For a long time there was a lull in
            the &ldquo;mud-pie&rdquo; business, and she devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she
            showed such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable. But
            overstrained eyes soon caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold attempt at poker
            sketching.<u><sup>eg</sup></u></p>
        <p>While this attack lasted, the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of burning wood
            pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers
            lay about promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at her
            door in case of fire. Raphael&rsquo;s face was found boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board,
            and Bacchus<u><sup>eh</sup></u> on the head of a beer barrel; a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the
            sugar bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied kindlings for some time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and Amy fell to painting with undiminished
            ardor. An artist friend fitted her out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she daubed away,
            producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on land or sea. Her monstrosities in the way of
            cattle would have taken prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching of her vessels would have
            produced seasickness in the most nautical observer, if the utter disregard to all known rules of
            shipbuilding and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance. Swarthy boys and dark-eyed
            Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio, suggested Murillo; oily-brown shadows of faces with
            a lurid streak in the wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropsical infants, Rubens; and
            Turner<u><sup>8</sup></u> appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange lightning, brown rain, and purple
            clouds, with a tomato-colored splash in the middle, which might be the sun or a buoy, a sailor&rsquo;s shirt
            or a king&rsquo;s robe, as the spectator pleased.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row, looking as wild and crocky as if just
            evoked from a coalbin. Softened into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good, and
            Amy&rsquo;s hair, Jo&rsquo;s nose, Meg&rsquo;s mouth, and Laurie&rsquo;s eyes were pronounced
            &ldquo;wonderfully fine.&rdquo; A return to clay and plaster followed, and ghostly casts of her
            acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or tumbled off closet shelves onto people&rsquo;s heads.
            Children were enticed in as models, till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy
            to be regarded in the light of a young ogress. Her efforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt
            close by an untoward accident, which quenched her ardor. Other models failing her for a time, she undertook
            to cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and
            running to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her foot held fast in a
            pan full of plaster, which had hardened with unexpected rapidity. With much difficulty and some danger she
            was dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that her knife went too far, cut the
            poor foot, and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt, at least.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her to haunting river, field, and wood,
            for picturesque studies, and sighing for ruins to copy. She caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to
            book &ldquo;a delicious bit,&rdquo; composed of a stone, a stump, one mushroom, and a broken
            mullein<u><sup>ei</sup></u> stalk, or &ldquo;a heavenly mass of clouds,&rdquo; that looked like a choice
            display of featherbeds when done. She sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun
            to study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after &ldquo;points of sight,&rdquo; or
            whatever the squint-and-string performance is called.<u><sup>ej</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If &ldquo;genius is eternal patience,&rdquo; as Michelangelo<u><sup>ek</sup></u> affirms, Amy had some claim
            to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly
            believing that in time she should do something worthy to be called &ldquo;high art.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she had resolved to be an attractive and
            accomplished woman, even if she never became a great artist. Here she succeeded better, for she was one of
            those happily created beings who please without effort, make friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully
            and easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star. Everybody
            liked her, for among her good gifts was tact. She had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper,
            always said the right thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and place, and was so
            self-possessed that her sisters used to say, &ldquo;If Amy went to court without any rehearsal beforehand,
            she&rsquo;d know exactly what to do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in &ldquo;our best society,&rdquo; without being quite sure what
            the best really was. Money, position, fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable
            things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed them, often mistaking the false for
            the true, and admiring what was not admirable. Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she
            cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the opportunity came she might be ready to
            take the place from which poverty now excluded her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine lady, and was so at
            heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer
            nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma,&rdquo; Amy said, coming in with an important air one day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, little girl, what is it?&rdquo; replied her mother, in whose eyes the stately young lady still
            remained &ldquo;the baby.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate for the summer, I want to ask
            them out here for a day. They are wild to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the
            things they admire in my book. They have been very kind to me in many ways, and I am grateful, for they are
            all rich and know I am poor, yet they never made any difference.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why should they?&rdquo; And Mrs. March put the question with what the girls called her &ldquo;Maria
            Theresa air.&rdquo;<u><sup>el</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You know as well as I that it does make a difference with nearly everyone, so don&rsquo;t ruffle up
            like a dear, motherly hen, when your chickens get pecked by smarter birds; the ugly duckling turned out a
            swan, you know.&rdquo; And Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed a happy temper and hopeful
            spirit.</p>
        <p>Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked, &ldquo;Well, my swan, what is your
            plan?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them a drive to the places they want to
            see, a row on the river, perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That looks feasible. What do you want for lunch? Cake, sandwiches, fruit, and coffee will be all that
            is necessary, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no! We must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate and ice cream, besides. The girls
            are used to such things, and I want my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for my
            living.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How many young ladies are there?&rdquo; asked her mother, beginning to look sober.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won&rsquo;t all come.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them about.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing? Not more than six or eight will probably come, so I
            shall hire a beach wagon and borrow Mr. Laurence&rsquo;s cherry-bounce.&rdquo; (Hannah&rsquo;s pronunciation
            of char&agrave;banc.)<u><sup>em</sup></u></p>
        <p>&ldquo;All this will be expensive, Amy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not very. I&rsquo;ve calculated the cost, and I&rsquo;ll pay for it myself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things, and the best we can do will
            be nothing new, that some simpler plan would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and much
            better for us than buying or borrowing what we don&rsquo;t need, and attempting a style not in keeping with
            our circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t have it as I like, I don&rsquo;t care to have it at all. I know that I can carry it
            out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help a little, and I don&rsquo;t see why I can&rsquo;t if
            I&rsquo;m willing to pay for it,&rdquo; said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into
            obstinacy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it was possible she left her children to
            learn alone the lessons which she would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking advice
            as much as they did salts and senna.<u><sup>en</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way through without too great an outlay
            of money, time, and temper, I&rsquo;ll say no more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you
            decide, I&rsquo;ll do my best to help you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind.&rdquo; And away went Amy to lay her plan before her sisters.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she possessed, from her little house
            itself to her very best salt-spoons. But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with
            it at first.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and turn the house upside down for a
            parcel of girls who don&rsquo;t care a sixpence for you? I thought you had too much pride and sense to
            truckle<u><sup>eo</sup></u> to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and rides in a
            coup&eacute;,&rdquo;<u><sup>ep</sup></u> said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of her novel, was
            not in the best mood for social enterprises.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!&rdquo; returned Amy indignantly,
            for the two still jangled when such questions arose. &ldquo;The girls do care for me, and I for them, and
            there&rsquo;s a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you call
            fashionable nonsense. You don&rsquo;t care to make people like you, to go into good society, and cultivate
            your manners and tastes. I do, and I mean to make the most of every chance that comes. You can go through
            the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it independence, if you like. That&rsquo;s
            not my way.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the best of it, for she seldom failed to
            have common sense on her side, while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to such an
            unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an argument. Amy&rsquo;s definition of
            Jo&rsquo;s idea of independence was such a good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a
            more amiable turn. Much against her will, Jo at length consented to sacrifice a day to Mrs.
            Grundy,<u><sup>eq</sup></u> and help her sister through what she regarded as &ldquo;a nonsensical
            business.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following Monday was set apart for the grand event.
            Hannah was out of humor because her week&rsquo;s work was deranged, and prophesied that &ldquo;ef the
            washin&rsquo; and ironin&rsquo; warn&rsquo;t done reg&lsquo;lar nothin&rsquo; would go well
            any-wheres.&rdquo; This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the whole
            concern, but Amy&rsquo;s motto was &ldquo;Nil desperandum,&rdquo; <u><sup>er</sup></u>and having made up her
            mind what to do, she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles. To begin with, Hannah&rsquo;s cooking
            didn&rsquo;t turn out well: the chicken was tough, the tongue too salty, and the chocolate wouldn&rsquo;t
            froth properly; Then the cake and ice cost more than Amy expected, so did the wagon; and various other
            expenses, which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward. Beth got cold and
            took to her bed, Meg had an unusual number of callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided
            state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous, serious, and trying.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Mother I never should have got through,&rdquo; as Amy declared afterward,
            and gratefully remembered when &ldquo;the best joke of the season&rdquo; was entirely forgotten by everybody
            else.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on Tuesday&mdash;an arrangement which aggravated
            Jo and Hannah to the last degree. On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more
            exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a little, shone a little, blew a little, and didn&rsquo;t make
            up its mind till it was too late for anyone else to make up theirs. Amy was up at dawn, hustling people out
            of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be got in order. The parlor struck her as
            looking uncommonly shabby, but without stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skillfully made the best
            of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the carpet, covering stains on the walls with
            pictures framed in ivy, and filling up empty corners with homemade statuary, which gave an artistic air to
            the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped it would taste well, and that the
            borrowed glass, china, and silver would get safely home again. The carriages were promised, Meg and Mother
            were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as
            lively and amiable as an absent mind, an aching head, and a very decided disapproval of everybody and
            everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy
            moment when, lunch safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic
            delights; for the &ldquo;cherry-bounce&rdquo; and the broken bridge were her strong points.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then came two hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor to porch, while public opinion varied
            like the weathercock. A smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young ladies who
            were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came; and at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine
            to consume the perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so we must fly round and be ready for
            them,&rdquo; said Amy, as the sun woke her next morning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest
            like her cake was getting a little stale.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad today,&rdquo; said Mr. March,
            coming in half an hour later, with an expression of placid despair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Use the chicken then, the toughness won&rsquo;t matter in a salad,&rdquo; advised his wife.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at it. I&rsquo;m very sorry,
            Amy,&rdquo; added Beth, who was still a patroness of cats.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Amy decidedly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Shall I rush into town and demand one?&rdquo; asked Jo, with the magnanimity of a martyr.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, just to try me. I&rsquo;ll go
            myself,&rdquo; answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to fail.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she departed, feeling that a cool drive
            would soothe her ruffled spirit and fit her for the labors of the day. After some delay, the object of her
            desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further loss of time at home, and off she
            drove again, well pleased with her own forethought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady, Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the
            tedium of the way by trying to find out</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>where all her money had gone to. So busy was she with her card full of refractory figures that she did not
            observe a newcomer, who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said, &ldquo;Good
            morning, Miss March,&rdquo; and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie&rsquo;s most elegant college friends.
            Fervently hoping that he would get out before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and
            congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress, returned the young man&rsquo;s greeting with
            her usual suavity and spirit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They got on excellently, for Amy&rsquo;s chief care was soon set at rest by learning that the gentleman would
            leave first, and she was chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In stumbling
            to the door, she upset the basket, and&mdash;oh, horror!&mdash;the lobster, in all its vulgar size and
            brilliancy, was revealed to the highborn eyes of a Tudor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;By Jove, she&rsquo;s forgotten her dinner!&rdquo; cried the unconscious<u><sup>es</sup></u> youth,
            poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing to hand out the basket after the old
            lady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Please don&lsquo;t&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; murmured Amy, with a face nearly as
            red as her fish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, really, I beg pardon. It&rsquo;s an uncommonly fine one, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Tudor, with
            great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest that did credit to his breeding.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat, and said, laughing, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
            you wish you were to have some of the salad he&rsquo;s going to make, and to see the charming young ladies
            who are to eat it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind were touched: the lobster was
            instantly surrounded by a halo of pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about &ldquo;the charming young
            ladies&rdquo; diverted his mind from the comical mishap.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan&rsquo;t see them, that&rsquo;s a
            comfort,&rdquo; thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that, thanks to the upset, her new dress was
            much damaged by the rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the
            preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve o&lsquo;clock all was ready again.
            Feeling that the neighbors were interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of
            yesterday&rsquo;s failure by a grand success today; so she ordered the &ldquo;cherry-bounce,&rdquo; and
            drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the rumble, they&rsquo;re coming! I&rsquo;ll go onto the porch to meet them; it looks
            hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good time after all her trouble,&rdquo; said Mrs. March,
            suiting the action to the word. But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable expression, for,
            looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one young lady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table; it will be too absurd to put a
            luncheon for twelve before a single girl,&rdquo; cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited
            to stop even for a laugh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who had kept her promise; the rest of the
            family, being of a dramatic turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a most
            hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the merriment which possessed them. The remodeled
            lunch being gaily partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with enthusiasm, Amy ordered
            a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce!) and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till
            sunset, when &ldquo;the party went out.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she observed that every vestige of
                the unfortunate fete had disappeared, except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo&rsquo;s mouth.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a lovely afternoon for your drive, dear,&rdquo; said her mother, as respectfully as
            if the whole twelve had come. &ldquo;Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I
            thought,&rdquo; observed Beth, with unusual warmth.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I have so much company, and I can&rsquo;t
            make such delicious stuff as yours,&rdquo; asked Meg soberly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Take it all. I&rsquo;m the only one here who likes sweet things, and it will mold before I can dispose
            of it,&rdquo; answered Amy, thinking with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as
            this.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity Laurie isn&rsquo;t here to help us,&rdquo; began Jo, as they sat down to ice cream
            and salad for the second time in two days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the whole family ate in heroic silence, till
            Mr. March mildly observed, &ldquo;Salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and
            Evelyn&rdquo;&mdash;here a general explosion of laughter cut short the &ldquo;history of sallets,&rdquo; to
            the great surprise of the learned gentleman.<u><sup>et</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels: Germans like messes.<u><sup>eu</sup></u>
            I&rsquo;m sick of the sight of this, and there&rsquo;s no reason you should all die of a surfeit because
            I&rsquo;ve been a fool,&rdquo; cried Amy, wiping her eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling about in the what-you-call-it, like two
            little kernels in a very big nut-shell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng,&rdquo; sighed Jo,
            quite spent with laughter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to satisfy you,&rdquo; said
            Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I am satisfied; I&rsquo;ve done what I undertook, and it&rsquo;s not my fault that it failed; I
            comfort myself with that,&rdquo; said Amy, with a little quiver in her voice. &ldquo;I thank you all very
            much for helping me, and I&rsquo;ll thank you still more if you won&rsquo;t allude to it for a month, at
            least.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No one did for several months; but the word &ldquo;fete&rdquo; always produced a general smile, and
            Laurie&rsquo;s birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.

        <p>Literary Lessons</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good-luck penny in her path. Not a golden penny, exactly, but
            I doubt if half a million would have given more real happiness than did the little sum that came to her in
            this wise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her scribbling suit, and &ldquo;fall into a
            vortex,&rdquo; as she expressed it, writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was
            finished she could find no peace. Her &ldquo;scribbling suit&rdquo; consisted of a black woolen pinafore on
            which she could wipe her pen at will, and a cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into
            which she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action. This cap was a beacon to the inquiring
            eyes of her family, who during these periods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads
            semi-occasionally to ask, with interest, &ldquo;Does genius burn, Jo?&rdquo; They did not always venture
            even to ask this question, but took an observation of the cap, and judged accordingly. If this expressive
            article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that hard work was going on, in exciting
            moments it was pushed rakishly askew, and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and cast
            upon the floor. At such times the intruder silently withdrew, and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect
            upon the gifted brow, did anyone dare address Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She did not think herself a genius by any means; but when the writing fit came on, she gave herself up to it
            with entire abandon, and led a blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat safe
            and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh. Sleep
            forsook her eyes, meals stood untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which
            blessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth living, even if they bore no other fruit. The
            divine afflatus<u><sup>ev</sup></u> usually lasted a week or two, and then she emerged from her
            &ldquo;vortex,&rdquo; hungry, sleepy, cross, or despondent.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a
            lecture, and in return for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea. It was a People&rsquo;s Course, the
            lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for such an audience, but
            took it for granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding
            the glories of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour, and
            whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of the Sphinx.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking, Jo amused herself by examining the
            faces of the people who occupied the seat with them. On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads
            and bonnets to match, discussing Woman&rsquo;s Rights and making tatting. <u><sup>ew</sup></u> Beyond sat a
            pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the hand, a somber spinster eating pepper-mints out
            of a paper bag, and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna. On her right, her
            only neighbor was a studious-looking lad absorbed in a newspaper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her, idly wondering what unfortuitous
            concatenation of circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume,
            tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally
            small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying away in the
            background with her mouth wide open. Pausing to turn a page, the lad saw her looking and, with boyish good
            nature, offered half his paper, saying bluntly, &ldquo;Want to read it? That&rsquo;s a first-rate
            story.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for lads, and soon found herself involved
            in the usual labyrinth of love, mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light
            literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author&rsquo;s invention fails, a grand
            catastrophe clears the stage of one half the dramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over their
            downfall.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Prime, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked the boy, as her eye went down the last paragraph of her portion.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,&rdquo; returned Jo, amused at his admiration
            of the trash.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She makes a good living out of such stories, they
            say.&rdquo; And he pointed to the name of Mrs. S. L. A. N.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Northbury,<u><sup>ex</sup></u> under the title of the tale.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo; asked Jo, with sudden interest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the office where this paper is
            printed.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?&rdquo; And Jo looked more respectfully at
            the agitated group and thickly sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Guess she does! She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well for writing it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while Professor Sands was prosing away about
            Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and hieroglyphics,<u><sup>9</sup></u> she was covertly taking down the address of
            the paper, and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its columns for a sensational
            story. By the time the lecture ended and the audience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself
            (not the first founded upon paper), and was already deep in the concoction of her story, being unable to
            decide whether the duel should come before the elopement or after the murder.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much to the disquiet of her mother, who
            always looked a little anxious when &ldquo;genius took to burning.&rdquo; Jo had never tried this style
            before, contenting herself with very mild romances for The Spread Eagle. Her theatrical experience and
            miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied
            plot, language, and costumes. Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her limited acquaintance
            with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to make it, and, having located it in
            Lisbon,<u><sup>ey</sup></u> she wound up with an earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement. The
            manuscript was privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that if the tale didn&rsquo;t
            get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect, she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be
            considered worth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to keep a secret, but Jo did both, and
            was just beginning to give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which
            almost took her breath away, for on opening it, a check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap. For a
            minute she stared at it as if it had been a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry. If the amiable
            gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense happiness he was giving a fellow
            creature, I think he would devote his leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement; for Jo valued the
            letter more than the money, because it was encouraging, and after years of effort it was so pleasant to find
            that she had learned to do something, though it was only to write a sensation story.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed herself, she electrified the family by
            appearing before them with the letter</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won the prize. Of course there was a great
            jubilee, and when the story came everyone read and praised it; though after her father had told her that the
            language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the tragedy quite thrilling, he shook his head, and
            said in his unworldly way&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You can do better than this, Jo. Aim at the highest, and never mind the money.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think the money is the best part of it. What will you do with such a fortune?&rdquo; asked Amy,
            regarding the magic slip of paper with a reverential eye.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two,&rdquo; answered Jo promptly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, how splendid! No, I can&rsquo;t do it, dear, it would be so selfish,&rdquo; cried Beth, who had
            clapped her thin hands and taken a long breath, as if pining for fresh ocean breeze, then stopped herself
            and motioned away the check which her sister waved before her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah, but you shall go, I&rsquo;ve set my heart on it. That&rsquo;s what I tried for, and that&rsquo;s
            why I succeeded. I never get on when I think of myself alone, so it will help me to work for you,
            don&rsquo;t you see? Besides, Marmee needs the change, and she won&rsquo;t leave you, so you must go.
            Won&rsquo;t it be fun to see you come home plump and rosy again? Hurrah for Dr. Jo, who always cures her
            patients!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth didn&rsquo;t come home as plump and rosy as
            could be desired, she was much better, while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger; so Jo was
            satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with a cheery spirit, bent on earning
            more of those delightful checks. She did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the
            house, for by the magic of a pen, her &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo; turned into comforts for them all. The
            Duke&rsquo;s Daughter paid the butcher&rsquo;s bill, A Phantom Hand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of
            the Coventrys proved the blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny side, and one of the sweet uses of
            adversity is the genuine satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand; and to the inspiration
            of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful blessings of the world. Jo enjoyed a taste of this
            satisfaction, and ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could supply
            her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market, and encouraged by this fact, she resolved to
            make a bold stroke for fame and fortune. Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to all her
            confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling to three publishers, she at last disposed of
            it, on condition that she would cut it down one third, and omit all the parts which she particularly
            admired.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now I must either bundle it back into my tin kitchen to mold, pay for printing it myself, or chop it
            up to suit purchasers and get what I can for it. Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is
            more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important subject,&rdquo; said Jo,
            calling a family council.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know, and the idea is well
            worked out. Let it wait and ripen,&rdquo; was her father&rsquo;s advice; and he practiced as he preached,
            having waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no haste to gather it even
            now when it was sweet and mellow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It seems to me that Jo will profit more by making the trial than by waiting,&rdquo; said Mrs. March.
            &ldquo;Criticism is the best test of such work, for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and
            help her to do better next time. We are too partial, but the praise and blame of outsiders will prove
            useful, even if she gets but little money.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jo, knitting her brows, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just it. I&rsquo;ve been fussing over the
            thing so long, I really don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s good, bad, or indifferent. It will be a great
            help to have cool, impartial persons take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t leave out a word of it; you&rsquo;ll spoil it if you do, for the interest of the
            story is more in the minds than in the actions of the people, and it will be all a muddle if you don&rsquo;t
            explain as you go on,&rdquo; said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable novel ever
            written.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But Mr. Allen says, &lsquo;Leave out the explanations, make it brief and dramatic, and let the
            characters tell the story,&rsquo; &rdquo; interrupted Jo, turning to the publisher&rsquo;s note.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do as he tells you, he knows what will sell, and we don&rsquo;t. Make a good, popular book, and get as
            much money as you can. By-and-by, when you&rsquo;ve got a name, you can afford to digress, and have
            philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels,&rdquo; said Amy, who took a strictly practical view of
            the subject.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jo, laughing, &ldquo;if my people are &lsquo;philosophical and metaphysical,&rsquo;
            it isn&rsquo;t my fault, for I know nothing about such things, except what I hear Father say, sometimes. If
            I&rsquo;ve got some of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me. Now, Beth, what
            do you say?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I should so like to see it printed soon&rdquo; was all Beth said, and smiled in saying it; but there
            was an unconscious emphasis on the last word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike
            candor, which chilled Jo&rsquo;s heart for a minute with a foreboding fear, and decided her to make her
            little venture &ldquo;soon.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, with Spartan<u><sup>ez</sup></u> firmness, the young authoress laid her firstborn on her table, and
            chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre. In the hope of pleasing everyone, she took everyone&rsquo;s advice,
            and like the old man and his donkey in the fable suited nobody.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got into it, so that was allowed to remain
            though she had her doubts about it. Her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description ; out,
            therefore, it nearly all came, and with it many necessary links in the story. Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo
            piled up the agony to suit her, while Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in life, Jo
            quenched the sprightly scenes which relieved the somber character of the story. Then, to complete the ruin,
            she cut it down one third, and confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into the
            big, busy world to try its fate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it, likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so
            much greater than she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it took her some
            time to recover.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You said, Mother, that criticism would help me. But how can it, when it&rsquo;s so contradictory that
            I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;ve written a promising book or broken all the ten commandments?&rdquo;
            cried poor Jo, turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one
            minute, wrath and dire dismay the next. &ldquo;This man says, &lsquo;An exquisite book, full of truth,
            beauty, and earnestness; all is sweet, pure, and healthy,&rsquo; &rdquo; continued the perplexed authoress.
            &ldquo;The next, &lsquo;The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fancies, spiritual istic ideas, and
            unnatural characters.&lsquo; Now, as I had no theory of any kind, don&rsquo;t believe in
            Spiritualism,<u><sup>fa</sup></u> and copied my characters from life, I don&rsquo;t see how this critic can
            be right. Another says, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s one of the best American novels which has appeared for
            years&rsquo; (I know better than that); and the next asserts that &lsquo;though it is original, and written
            with great force and feeling, it is a dangerous book.&rsquo; &lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t! Some make fun of it, some
            overpraise, and nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to expound, when I only wrote it for the pleasure
            and the money. I wish I&rsquo;d printed it whole or not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally; yet it was a hard time for sensitive,
            high-spirited Jo, who meant so well and had apparently done so ill. But it did her good, for those whose
            opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an author&rsquo;s best education; and when the first
            soreness was over, she could laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel herself the
            wiser and stronger for the buffeting she</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>had received.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not being a genius, like Keats, it won&rsquo;t kill me,&rdquo;<u><sup>fb</sup></u> she said stoutly,
            &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts that were taken straight out of real
            life are denounced as impossible and absurd, and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are
            pronounced &lsquo;charmingly natural, tender, and true.&rsquo; So I&rsquo;ll comfort myself with that, and
            when I&rsquo;m ready, I&rsquo;ll up again and take another.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>28</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Domestic Experiences</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like most other young matrons, Meg began her married life with the determination to be a model housekeeper.
            John should find home a paradise, he should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously every day,
            and never know the loss of a button. She brought so much love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she
            could not but succeed, in spite of some obstacles. Her paradise was not a tranquil one, for the little woman
            fussed, was overanxious to please, and bustled about like a true Martha,<u><sup>fc</sup></u> cumbered with
            many cares. She was too tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course of dainty dishes
            and ungratefully demanded plain fare. As for buttons, she soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake
            her head over the carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself, and see if his work
            would stand impatient tugs and clumsy fingers any better than hers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn&rsquo;t live on love alone. John did not
            find Meg&rsquo;s beauty diminished, though she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffeepot ; nor did
            Meg miss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her husband followed up his kiss with the tender
            inquiry, &ldquo;Shall I send home veal or mutton for dinner, darling?&rdquo; The little house ceased to be a
            glorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple soon felt that it was a change for the better.
            At first they played keep-house, and frolicked over it like children; then John took steadily to business,
            feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders; and Meg laid by her
            cambric<u><sup>fd</sup></u> wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to work, as before said, with more energy
            than discretion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius&rsquo;s Receipt Book<u><sup>fe</sup></u> as if
            it were a mathematical exercise, working out the problems with patience and care. Sometimes her family were
            invited in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be privately dispatched with a
            batch of failures, which were to be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little
            Hummels. An evening with John over the account books usually produced a temporary lull in the culinary
            enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread
            pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although he bore it with praiseworthy
            fortitude. Before the golden mean was found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young
            couples seldom get on long without&mdash;a family jar.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fired with a housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with homemade preserves, she undertook to put up
            her own currant jelly. John was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra quantity
            of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be attended to at once. As John firmly believed that
            &ldquo;my wife&rdquo; was equal to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that she
            should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use. Home came
            four dozen delightful little pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for her.
            With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the elbow, and a checked apron which had a
            coquettish look in spite of the bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her success,
            for hadn&rsquo;t she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times? The array of pots rather amazed her at first, but
            John was so fond of jelly, and the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg resolved
            to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling, straining, and fussing over her jelly. She did her
            best, she asked advice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah did that she left
            undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but that dreadful stuff wouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;jell.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend a hand, but John and she had agreed that they
            would never annoy anyone with their private worries, experiments, or quarrels. They had laughed over that
            last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one; but they had held to their resolve, and
            whenever they could get on without help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had advised the
            plan. So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day, and at five
            o&lsquo;clock sat down in her topsy-turvy kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and wept.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, &ldquo;My husband shall always feel free to
            bring a friend home whenever he likes. I shall always be prepared; there shall be no flurry, no scolding, no
            discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good dinner. John, dear, never stop to ask my leave,
            invite whom you please, and be sure of a welcome from me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How charming that was, to be sure! John quite glowed with pride to hear her say it, and felt what a blessed
            thing it was to have a superior wife. But, although they had had company from time to time, it never
            happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an opportunity to distinguish herself till now. It always
            happens so in this vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things which we can only wonder at,
            deplore, and bear as we best can.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have been unpardonable in him to choose that
            day, of all the days in the year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly. Congratulating himself that
            a handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute, and
            indulging in pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when his pretty wife came
            running out to meet him, he escorted his friend to his mansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a
            young host and husband.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached the Dovecote. The front door usually
            stood hospitably open; now it was not only shut, but locked, and yesterday&rsquo;s mud still adorned the
            steps. The parlor windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza,.in
            white, with a distracting little bow in her hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she
            greeted her guest. Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared but a sanguinary-looking<u><sup>ff</sup></u>
            boy asleep under the currant bushes.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid something has happened. Step into the garden, Scott, while I look up Mrs.
            Brooke,&rdquo; said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned sugar, and Mr. Scott strolled after him, with a
            queer look on his face. He paused discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared, but he could both see
            and hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair; one edition of jelly was trickled from pot to pot, another lay
            upon the floor, and a third was burning gaily on the stove. Lotty, with Teutonic<u><sup>fg</sup></u> phlegm,
            was calmly eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly liquid state, while Mrs.
            Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat sobbing dismally.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My dearest girl, what is the matter?&rdquo; cried John, rushing in, with awful visions of scalded
            hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried! I&rsquo;ve been at it till I&rsquo;m all worn
            out. Do come and help me or I shall die!&rdquo; And the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast,
            giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore had been baptized at the same time
            as the floor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What worries you, dear? Has anything dreadful happened?&rdquo; asked the anxious John, tenderly
            kissing the crown of the little cap, which was all askew.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sobbed Meg despairingly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tell me quick, then. Don&rsquo;t cry, I can bear anything better than that. Out with it, love.&rdquo;
            &ldquo;The&mdash;the jelly won&rsquo;t jell and I don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward, and the derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as
            he heard the hearty peal, which put the finishing stroke to poor Meg&rsquo;s woe.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is that all? Fling it out of window, and don&rsquo;t bother any more about it. I&rsquo;ll buy you
            quarts if you want it; but for heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t have hysterics, for I&rsquo;ve brought Jack
            Scott home to dinner, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands with a tragic gesture as she fell into a
            chair, exclaiming in a tone of mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A man to dinner, and everything in a mess! John Brooke, how could you do such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hush, he&rsquo;s in the garden! I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can&rsquo;t be helped
            now,&rdquo; said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to have remembered how busy I
            was,&rdquo; continued Meg petulantly, for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for I met him on the way out.
            I never thought of asking leave, when you have always told me to do as I liked. I never tried it before, and
            hang me if I ever do again!&rdquo; added John, with an aggrieved air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I should hope not! Take him away at once; I can&rsquo;t see him and there isn&rsquo;t any
            dinner.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I like that! Where&rsquo;s the beef and vegetables I sent home, and the pudding you
            promised?&rdquo; cried John, rushing to the larder.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t time to cook anything; I meant to dine at Mother&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m sorry, but I was so
            busy;&rdquo; and Meg&rsquo;s tears began again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>John was a mild man, but he was human; and after a long day&rsquo;s work to come home tired, hungry, and
            hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty table, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of
            mind or manner. He restrained himself, however, and the little squall would have blown over, but for one
            unlucky word.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we&rsquo;ll pull through and have a
            good time yet. Don&rsquo;t cry, dear, but just exert yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat.
            We&rsquo;re both as hungry as hunters, so we shan&rsquo;t mind what it is. Give us the cold meat, and bread
            and cheese; we won&rsquo;t ask for jelly.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He meant it for a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed his fate. Meg thought it was too cruel to hint
            about her sad failure, and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can, I&rsquo;m too used up to &lsquo;exert&rsquo;
            myself for anyone. It&rsquo;s like a man to propose a bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company. I
            won&rsquo;t have anything of the sort in my house. Take that Scott up to Mother&rsquo;s, and tell him
            I&rsquo;m away, sick, dead&mdash;anything. I won&rsquo;t see him, and you two can laugh at me and my jelly
            as much as you like: you won&rsquo;t have anything else here.&rdquo; And having delivered her defiance all
            on one breath, Meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own
            room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew; but Mr. Scott was not taken &ldquo;up to
            Mother&lsquo;s,&rdquo; and when Meg descended, after they had strolled away together, she found traces of a
            promiscuous lunch which filled her with horror. Lotty reported that they had eaten &ldquo;a much, and
            greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the sweet stuff, and hide the pots.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her own shortcomings, of loyalty to John,
            &ldquo;who might be cruel, but nobody should know it,&rdquo; restrained her, and after a summary clearing
            up, she dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be forgiven.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, John didn&rsquo;t come, not seeing the matter in that light. He had carried it off as a good
            joke with Scott, excused his little wife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his
            friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again. But John was angry, though he did not show
            it; he felt that Meg had got him into a scrape, and then deserted him in his hour of need. &ldquo;It
            wasn&rsquo;t fair to tell a man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he took you at
            your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to be laughed at or pitied. No, by George,
            it wasn&lsquo;t! and Meg must know it.&rdquo; He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry
            was over and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came over him. &ldquo;Poor little thing!
            It was hard upon her when she tried so heartily to please me. She was wrong, of course, but then she was
            young. I must be patient and teach her.&rdquo; He hoped she had not gone home&mdash;he hated gossip and
            interference. For a minute he was ruffled again at the mere thought of it; and then the fear that Meg would
            cry herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace, resolving to be calm and kind, but
            firm, quite firm, and show her where she had failed in her duty to her spouse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg likewise resolved to be &ldquo;calm and kind, but firm,&rdquo; and show him his duty. She longed to run
            to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed and comforted, as she was sure of being; but, of course, she did
            nothing of the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally, as she rocked and sewed,
            like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe,<u><sup>fh</sup></u> but feeling that his dignity
            demanded the first apology, he made none, only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the
            singularly relevant remark, &ldquo;We are going to have a new moon, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no objection&rdquo; was Meg&rsquo;s equally soothing remark.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A few other topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and
            conversation languished. John went to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,
            figuratively speaking. Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if new rosettes for her slippers were
            among the necessaries of life. Neither spoke; both looked quite &ldquo;calm and firm,&rdquo; and both felt
            desperately uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; thought Meg, &ldquo;married life is very trying, and does need infinite patience as
            well as love, as Mother says.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; suggested other maternal counsels given
            long ago, and received with unbelieving protests.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see and bear with them, remembering
            your own. He is very decided, but never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently. He
            is very accurate, and particular about the truth&mdash;a good trait, though you call him
            &lsquo;fussy.&rsquo; Never deceive him by look or word, Meg, and he will give you the confidence you
            deserve, the support you need. He has a temper, not like ours&mdash;one flash and then all over&mdash;but
            the white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to quench. Be careful, very careful,
            not to wake his anger against yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect. Watch
            yourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against the little piques,
            misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset, especially the last. This was the first
            serious disagreement; her own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her own
            anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart. She
            glanced at him with tears in her eyes, but he did not see them; she put down her work and got up, thinking,
            &ldquo;I will be the first to say, &lsquo;Forgive me,&rdquo;&rsquo; but he did not seem to hear her; she
            went very slowly across the room, for pride was hard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>his head. For a minute she felt as if she really couldn&rsquo;t do it; then came the thought, &ldquo;This is
            the beginning, I&rsquo;ll do my part, and have nothing to reproach myself with,&rdquo; and stooping down,
            she softly kissed her husband on the forehead. Of course that settled it; the penitent kiss was better than
            a world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying tenderly:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive me, dear, I never will again!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both declaring that it was the sweetest
            jelly they ever made, for family peace was preserved in that little family jar.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and served him up a pleasant feast without a
            cooked wife for the first course; on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made everything go off
            so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a happy fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of
            bachelorhood all the way home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg. Sallie Moffat renewed her friendship, was always
            running out for a dish of gossip at the little house, or inviting &ldquo;that poor dear&rdquo; to come in
            and spend the day at the big house. It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often felt lonely; all were
            busy at home, John absent till night, and nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter
            about.<u><sup>fi</sup></u> So it naturally fell out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with
            her friend. Seeing Sallie&rsquo;s pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself because she had not
            got them. Sallie was very kind, and often offered her the coveted trifles; but Meg declined them, knowing
            that John wouldn&rsquo;t like it; and then this foolish little woman went and did what John disliked
            infinitely worse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She knew her husband&rsquo;s income, and she loved to feel that he trusted her, not only with his happiness,
            but what some men seem to value more&mdash;his money. She knew where it was, was free to take what she
            liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny, pay bills once a month, and
            remember that she was a poor man&rsquo;s wife. Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her
            little account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without fear. But that autumn the serpent got
            into Meg&rsquo;s paradise, and tempted her like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress. Meg
            didn&rsquo;t like to be pitied and made to feel poor; it irritated her, but she was ashamed to confess it,
            and now and then she tried to console herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn&rsquo;t think
            she had to economize. She always felt wicked after it, for the pretty things were seldom necessaries; but
            then they cost so little, it wasn&rsquo;t worth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and
            in the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she cast up her accounts at the end of the month
            the sum total rather scared her. John was busy that month and left the bills to her, the next month he was
            absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg never forgot it. A few days before she
            had done a dreadful thing, and it weighed upon her conscience. Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg longed
            for a new one&mdash;just a handsome light one for parties, her black silk was so common, and thin things for
            evening wear were only proper for girls. Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of twenty-five
            dollars apiece at New Year&rsquo;s; that was only a month to wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going
            at a bargain, and she had the money, if she only dared to take it. John always said what was his was hers,
            but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective five-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty
            out of the household fund? That was the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to lend the
            money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg beyond her strength. In an evil moment the
            shopman held up the lovely, shimmering folds, and said, &ldquo;A bargain, I assure you, ma&lsquo;am.&rdquo;
            She answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie had exulted, and
            she had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had stolen
            something, and the police were after her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by spreading forth the lovely silk; but it
            looked less silvery now, didn&rsquo;t become her, after all, and the words &ldquo;fifty dollars&rdquo;
            seemed stamped like a pattern down each breadth. She put it away, but it haunted her, not delightfully as a
            new dress should, but dreadfully like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid. When John got out his
            books that night, Meg&rsquo;s heart sank, and for the first time in her married life, she was afraid of her
            husband. The kind, brown eyes looked as if they could be stern, and though he was unusually merry, she
            fancied he had found her out, but didn&rsquo;t mean to let her know it. The house bills were all paid, the
            books all in order. John had praised her, and was undoing the old pocketbook which they called the
            &ldquo;bank,&rdquo; when Meg, knowing that it was quite empty, stopped his hand, saying nervously&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen my private expense book yet.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>John never asked to see it; but she always insisted on his doing so, and used to enjoy his masculine
            amazement at the queer things women wanted, and made him guess what &ldquo;piping&rdquo;<u><sup>fj</sup></u>
            was, demand fiercely the meaning of a &ldquo;hug-me-tight,&rdquo;<u><sup>fk</sup></u> or wonder how a little
            thing composed of three rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a bonnet, and
            cost five or six dollars. That night he looked as if he would like the fun of quizzing her figures and
            pretending to be horrified at her extravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent
            wife.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. Meg got behind his chair under pretense of
            smoothing the wrinkles out of his tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her panic increasing
            with every word&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;John, dear, I&rsquo;m ashamed to show you my book, for I&rsquo;ve really been dreadfully extravagant
            lately. I go about so much I must have things, you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did; and my
            New Year&rsquo;s money will partly pay for it: but I was sorry after I&rsquo;d done it, for I knew
            you&rsquo;d think it wrong in me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>John laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying good-humoredly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go and hide. I
            won&rsquo;t beat you if yon have got a pair of killing boots; I&rsquo;m rather proud of my wife&rsquo;s
            feet, and don&rsquo;t mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good
            ones.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That had been one of her last &ldquo;trifles,&rdquo; and John&rsquo;s eye had fallen on it as he spoke.
            &ldquo;Oh, what will he say when he comes to that awful fifty dollars!&rdquo; thought Meg, with a shiver.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than boots, it&rsquo;s a silk dress,&rdquo; she said, with the calmness of
            desperation, for she wanted the worst over.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, dear, what is the &lsquo;dem&rsquo;d total,&rsquo; as Mr. Mantalini<u><sup>fl</sup></u>
            says?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That didn&rsquo;t sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at her with the straightforward look that
            she had always been ready to meet and answer with one as frank till now. She turned the page and her head at
            the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough without the fifty, but which was
            appalling to her with that added. For a minute the room was very still, then John said slowly&mdash;but she
            could feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the furbelows <u><sup>fm</sup></u>
            and notions you have to have to finish it off these days.&rdquo; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t made or
            trimmed,&rdquo; sighed Meg faintly, for a sudden recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite
            overwhelmed her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman, but I&rsquo;ve no doubt my wife
            will look as fine as Ned Moffat&rsquo;s when she gets it on,&rdquo; said John dryly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know you are angry, John, but I can&rsquo;t help it. I don&rsquo;t mean to waste your money, and I
            didn&rsquo;t think those little things would count up so. I can&rsquo;t resist them when I see Sallie buying
            all she wants, and pitying me because I don&rsquo;t. I try to be contented, but it is hard, and I&rsquo;m
            tired of being poor.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but he did, and they wounded him deeply,
            for he had denied himself many pleasures for Meg&rsquo;s sake. She could have bitten her tongue out the
            minute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up, saying with a little</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>quiver in his voice, &ldquo;I was afraid of this, I do my best, Meg.&rdquo; If he had scolded her, or even
            shaken her, it would not have broken her heart like those few words. She ran to him and held him close,
            crying, with repentant tears, &ldquo;Oh, John, my dear, kind, hard-working boy, I didn&rsquo;t mean it! It
            was so wicked, so untrue and ungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one reproach; but Meg knew that she had done and
            said a thing which would not be forgotten soon, although he might never allude to it again. She had promised
            to love him for better, for worse; and then she, his wife, had reproached him with his poverty, after
            spending his earnings recklessly. It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so quietly
            afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he stayed in town later, and worked at night when
            she had gone to cry herself to sleep. A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the discovery that John
            had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat <u><sup>fn</sup></u> reduced her to a state of despair
            which was pathetic to behold. He had simply said, in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change,
            &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford it, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with her face buried in the old greatcoat,
            crying as if her heart would break.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband better for his poverty, because it
            seemed to have made a man of him, given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him a
            tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings and failures of those he loved.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a
            favor. The good-natured Mrs. Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present of it
            immediately afterward. Then Meg ordered home the greatcoat, and, when John arrived, she put it on, and asked
            him how he liked her new silk gown. One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his present, and
            what a blissful state of things ensued. John came home early, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put
            on in the morning by a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted little wife. So the year
            rolled round, and at midsummer there came to Meg a new experience-the deepest and tenderest of a
            woman&rsquo;s life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one Saturday, with an excited face, and was received
            with the clash of cymbals, for Hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the other.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the little mamma? Where is everybody? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before I came
            home?&rdquo; began Laurie in a loud whisper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Happy as a queen, the dear! Every soul of &lsquo;em is upstairs a wor shipin&rsquo; ; we didn&rsquo;t
            want no hurrycanes round. Now you go into the parlor, and I&rsquo;ll send &rsquo;em down to you,&rdquo; with
            which somewhat involved reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon a large pillow. Jo&rsquo;s face was
            very sober, but her eyes twinkled, and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some
            sort.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Shut your eyes and hold out your arms,&rdquo; she said invitingly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind him with an imploring gesture: &ldquo;No,
            thank you, I&rsquo;d rather not. I shall drop it or smash it, as sure as fate.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then you shan&rsquo;t see your nevvy,&rdquo; said Jo decidedly, turning as if to go.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I will, I will! Only you must be responsible for damages.&rdquo; And, obeying orders, Laurie
            heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms. A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March,
            Hannah, and John caused him to open them the next minute, to find himself invested with two babies instead
            of one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough to convulse a
            Quaker,<u><sup>fo</sup></u> as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious
            spectators with such dismay that Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Twins, by Jupiter!&rdquo; was all he said for a minute, then turning to the women with an appealing
            look that was comically piteous, he added, &ldquo;Take &lsquo;em quick, somebody! I&rsquo;m going to laugh,
            and I shall drop &rsquo; em.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>John rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm, as if already initiated into the
            mysteries of baby-tending, while Laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best joke of the season, isn&rsquo;t it? I wouldn&rsquo;t have you told, for I set my
            heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself I&rsquo;ve done it,&rdquo; said Jo, when she got her breath.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I never was more staggered in my life. Isn&rsquo;t it fun? Are they boys? What are you going to name
            them? Let&rsquo;s have another look. Hold me up, Jo, for upon my life it&rsquo;s one too many for me,&rdquo;
            returned Laurie, regarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland <u><sup>fp</sup></u>
            looking at a pair of infantile kittens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Boy and girl. Aren&rsquo;t they beauties?&rdquo; said the proud papa, beaming upon the little red
            squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Most remarkable children I ever saw. Which is which?&rdquo; and Laurie bent like a
            well-sweep<u><sup>fq</sup></u> to examine the prodigies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French fashion, so you can always tell.
            Besides, one has blue eyes and one brown. Kiss them, Uncle Teddy,&rdquo; said wicked Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they mightn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; began Laurie, with unusual timidity in such
            matters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course they will, they are used to it now. Do it this minute, sir!&rdquo; commanded Jo, fearing he
            might propose a proxy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each little cheek that produced another laugh,
            and made the babies squeal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There, I knew they didn&rsquo;t like it! That&rsquo;s the boy, see him kick, he hits out with his
            fists like a good one. Now then, young Brooke, pitch into a man of your own size, will you?&rdquo; cried
            Laurie, delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother and grandmother. We shall
            call her Daisy, so as not to have two Megs, and I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a better
            name,&rdquo; said Amy, with aunt-like interest.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Name him Demijohn, and call him &lsquo;Demi&rsquo;<u><sup>fr</sup></u> for short,&rdquo; said Laurie.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Daisy and Demi&mdash;just the thing! I knew Teddy would do it,&rdquo; cried Jo, clapping her hands.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were &ldquo;Daisy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Demi&rdquo; to the
            end of the chapter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>29</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Calls</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Come Jo, it&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me
            today?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I don&rsquo;t think I ever was mad
            enough to say I&rsquo;d make six calls in one day, when a single one upsets me for a week.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us. I was to finish the crayon of Beth for you, and you were to
            go properly with me, and return our neighbors&rsquo; visits.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If it was fair&mdash;that was in the bond; and I stand to the letter of my bond, Shylock.
            <u><sup>fs</sup></u> There is a pile of clouds in the east, it&rsquo;s not fair, and I don&rsquo;t
            go.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s shirking. It&rsquo;s a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you pride yourself on
            keeping promises; so be honorable, come and do your duty, and then be at peace for another six
            months.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking; for she was mantua-maker<u><sup>ft</sup></u>
            general to the family, and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen.
            It was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make calls in her
            best array on a warm July day. She hated calls of the formal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her
            with a bargain, bribe, or promise. In the present instance there was no escape; and having clashed her
            scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she smelled thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking
            up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready. You don&rsquo;t</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint! You don&rsquo;t intend to make calls in that
            state, I hope,&rdquo; cried Amy, surveying her with amazement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why not? I&rsquo;m neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day. If
            people care more for my clothes than they do for me, I don&rsquo;t wish to see them. You can dress for both,
            and be as elegant as you please: it pays for you to be fine; it doesn&rsquo;t for me, and furbelows only
            worry me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; sighed Amy, &ldquo;now she&rsquo;s in a contrary fit, and will drive me distracted
            before I can get her properly ready. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s no pleasure to me to go today, but it&rsquo;s
            a debt we owe society, and there&rsquo;s no one to pay it but you and me. I&rsquo;ll do anything for you,
            Jo, if you&rsquo;ll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil. You can talk so well,
            look so aristocratic in your best things, and behave so beautifully, if you try, that I&rsquo;m proud of
            you. I&rsquo;m afraid to go alone, do come and take care of me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old sister in that way. The idea
            of my being aristocratic and well-bred, and your being afraid to go anywhere alone! I don&rsquo;t know which
            is the most absurd. Well, I&rsquo;ll go if I must, and do my best. You shall be commander of the expedition,
            and I&rsquo;ll obey blindly, will that satisfy you?&rdquo; said Jo, with a sudden change from perversity to
            lamblike submission.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a perfect cherub! Now put on all your best things, and I&rsquo;ll tell you how to behave
            at each place, so that you will make a good impression. I want people to like you, and they would if
            you&rsquo;d only try to be a little more agreeable. Do your hair the pretty way, and put the pink rose in
            your bonnet; it&rsquo;s becoming, and you look too sober in your plain suit. Take your light gloves and the
            embroidered handkerchief. We&rsquo;ll stop at Meg&lsquo;s, and borrow her white sunshade, and then you can
            have my dove-colored one.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, not without entering her protest, however, for
            she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie,<u><sup>fu</sup></u> frowned darkly at herself as she tied
            her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar, wrinkled
            up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose
            as the present mission was to her feelings; and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three
            buttons and a tassel, as the last touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of
            countenance, saying meekly&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly miserable; but if you consider me presentable, I die happy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are highly satisfactory; turn slowly round, and let me get a careful view.&rdquo; Jo revolved, and
            Amy gave a touch here and there, then fell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously,
            &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll do; your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet with the rose is quite
            ravishing. Hold back your shoulders, and carry your hands easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch.
            There&rsquo;s one thing you can do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl&mdash;I can&rsquo;t; but it&rsquo;s very
            nice to see you, and I&rsquo;m so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one; it&rsquo;s simple, but handsome,
            and those folds over the arm are really artistic. Is the point of my mantle<u><sup>fv</sup></u> in the
            middle, and have I looped my dress evenly? I like to show my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose
            isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,&rdquo;<u><sup>fw</sup></u> said Jo, looking through her
            hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the golden hair. &ldquo;Am I to drag my best
            dress through the dust, or loop it up, please, ma&lsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house; the sweeping style suits you best, and you must
            learn to trail your skirts gracefully. You haven&rsquo;t half buttoned one cuff, do it at once. You&rsquo;ll
            never look finished if you are not careful about the little details, for they make up the pleasing
            whole.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in doing up her cuff; but at last both were
            ready, and sailed away, looking as &ldquo;pretty as picters,&rdquo; Hannah said, as she hung out of the
            upper window to watch them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so I want you to put on your best
            deportment. Don&rsquo;t make any of your abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you? Just be calm, cool,
            and quiet&mdash;that&rsquo;s safe and ladylike, and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes,&rdquo; said
            Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a
            baby on each arm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Let me see. &lsquo;Calm, cool, and quiet&rsquo;&mdash;yes, I think I can promise that. I&rsquo;ve
            played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I&rsquo;ll try it off. My powers are great, as you
            shall see, so be easy in your mind, my child.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for during the first call she sat with every limb
            gracefully composed, every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snow-bank, and as silent
            as a sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her &ldquo;charming novel,&rdquo; and the Misses Chester
            introduced parties, picnics, the opera, and the fashions; each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and
            a demure &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; with the chill on. In vain Amy telegraphed the word
            &ldquo;talk,&rdquo; tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with her foot. Jo sat as if blandly
            unconscious of it all, with deportment like Maud&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;icily regular, splendidly
            null.&rdquo;<u><sup>fx</sup></u></p>
        <p>&ldquo;What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!&rdquo; was the unfortunately audible
            remark of one of the ladies, as the door closed upon</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>their guests. Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall, but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her
            instructions, and very naturally laid the blame upon Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How could you mistake me so? I merely meant you to be properly dignified and composed, and you made
            yourself a perfect stock and stone. Try to be sociable at the Lambs&lsquo;, gossip as other girls do, and be
            interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes up. They move in the best society, are
            valuable persons for us to know, and I wouldn&rsquo;t fail to make a good impression there for
            anything.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be agreeable, I&rsquo;ll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and raptures over any trifle
            you like. I rather enjoy this, and now I&rsquo;ll imitate what is called &lsquo;a charming girl,&rsquo; I
            can do it, for I have May Chester as a model, and I&rsquo;ll improve upon her. See if the Lambs don&rsquo;t
            say, &lsquo;What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish there was no knowing where she would stop.
            Amy&rsquo;s face was a study when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss all the young
            ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and join in the chat with a spirit which
            amazed the beholder. Amy was taken possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, and forced to
            hear a long account of Lucretia&rsquo;s last attack, while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near,
            waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her. So situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who
            seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as the old lady. A knot of heads
            gathered about her, and Amy strained her ears to hear what was going on, for broken sentences filled her
            with alarm, round eyes and uplifted hands tormented her with curiosity, and frequent peals of laughter made
            her wild to share the fun. One may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of
            conversation:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She rides splendidly&mdash;who taught her?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No one. She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and sitting straight on an old saddle in a
            tree. Now she rides anything, for she doesn&rsquo;t know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have
            horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well. She has such a passion for it, I often tell
            her if everything else fails she can be a horse-breaker, and get her living so.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for the impression was being given that she was
            rather a fast young lady, which was her especial aversion. But what could she do? For the old lady was in
            the middle of her story, and long before it was done Jo was off again, making more droll revelations and
            committing still more fearful blunders.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone, and of three left, one was lame,
            one blind, and the other so balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. Nice animal
            for a pleasure party, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Which did she choose?&rdquo; asked one of the laughing gentlemen, who enjoyed the subject.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;None of them. She heard of a young horse at the farmhouse over the river, and though a lady had never
            ridden him, she resolved to try, because he was handsome and spirited. Her struggles were really pathetic;
            there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she took the saddle to the horse. My dear creature,
            she actually rowed it over the river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the utter amazement
            of the old man!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Did she ride the horse?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course she did, and had a capital time. I expected to see her brought home in fragments, but she
            managed him perfectly, and was the life of the party.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I call that plucky!&rdquo; And young Mr. Lamb turned an approving glance upon Amy, wondering
            what his mother could be saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced
            the subject of dress. One of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to the
            picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it was bought two years ago, must needs answer
            with unnecessary frankness, &ldquo;Oh, Amy painted it. You can&rsquo;t buy those soft shades, so we paint
            ours any color we like. It&rsquo;s a great comfort to have an artistic sister.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that an original idea?&rdquo; cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There&rsquo;s nothing the child
            can&rsquo;t do. Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for Sallie&rsquo;s party, so she just painted her
            soiled white ones the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,&rdquo;
            added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister&rsquo;s accomplishments that exasperated Amy till she felt that
            it would be a relief to throw her cardcase at her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,&rdquo; observed the elder Miss Lamb,
            wishing to compliment the literary lady, who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Any mention of her &ldquo;works&rdquo; always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either grew rigid and looked
            offended, or changed the subject with a brusque remark, as now. &ldquo;Sorry you could find nothing better
            to read. I write that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it. Are you going to New York this
            winter?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Miss Lamb had &ldquo;enjoyed&rdquo; the story, this speech was not exactly grateful or complimentary. The
            minute it was made Jo saw her mistake, but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was
            for her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an abruptness that left three people with
            half-finished sentences in their mouths.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Amy, we must go. Good-by, dear, do come and see us; we are pining for a visit. I don&rsquo;t dare to
            ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if you should come, I don&rsquo;t think I shall have the heart to send you
            away.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester&rsquo;s gushing style that Amy got out of the room as
            rapidly as possible, feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I do that well?&rdquo; asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nothing could have been worse,&rdquo; was Amy&rsquo;s crushing reply. &ldquo;What possessed you to
            tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and boots, and all the rest of it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s funny, and amuses people. They know we are poor, so it&rsquo;s no use pretending that
            we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season, and have things as easy and fine as they do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our poverty in that perfectly
            unnecessary way. You haven&rsquo;t a bit of proper pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and
            when to speak,&rdquo; said Amy despairingly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with the stiff handkerchief, as if performing
            a penance for her misdemeanors.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How shall I behave here?&rdquo; she asked, as they approached the third mansion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just as you please. I wash my hands of you,&rdquo; was Amy&rsquo;s short answer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll enjoy myself. The boys are at home, and we&rsquo;ll have a comfortable time. Goodness
            knows I need a little change, for elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution,&rdquo; returned Jo
            gruffly, being disturbed by her failures to suit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children speedily soothed her ruffled
            feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo
            devoted herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing. She listened to college stories with
            deep interest, caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that &ldquo;Tom Brown was a
            brick,&rdquo;<u><sup>fy</sup></u> regardless of the improper form of praise; and when one lad proposed a
            visit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma to smile upon her, as that motherly
            lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and
            dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired Frenchwoman.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself to her heart&rsquo;s content. Mr.
            Tudor&rsquo;s uncle had married an English lady who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the
            whole family with great respect, for in spite of her American birth and breeding, she possessed that
            reverence for titles which haunts the best of us&mdash;that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in
            kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in a ferment at the coming of a royal yellow-haired
            laddie,<u><sup>fz</sup></u> some years ago, and which still has something to do with the love the young
            country bears the old, like that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while she could,
            and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled. But even the satisfaction of talking with a
            distant connection of the British nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the proper number
            of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo,
            fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which should bring disgrace
            upon the name of March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad; for Jo sat on the grass, with an encampment of boys
            about her, and a dirty-footed dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related one
            of Laurie&rsquo;s pranks to her admiring audience. One small child was poking turtles with Amy&rsquo;s
            cherished parasol, a second was eating gingerbread over Jo&rsquo;s best bonnet, and a third playing ball
            with her gloves. But all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her damaged property to go, her
            escort accompanied her, begging her to come again, &ldquo;It was such fun to hear about Laurie&rsquo;s
            larks.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Capital boys, aren&rsquo;t they? I feel quite young and brisk again after that,&rdquo; said Jo,
            strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?&rdquo; asked Amy, wisely refraining from any comment upon
            Jo&rsquo;s dilapidated appearance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his father, and doesn&rsquo;t speak
            respectfully of his mother. Laurie says he is fast, and I don&rsquo;t consider him a desirable acquaintance,
            so I let him alone.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You might treat him civilly, at least. You gave him a cool nod, and just now you bowed and smiled in
            the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain, whose father keeps a grocery store. If you had just reversed the nod
            and the bow, it would have been right,&rdquo; said Amy reprovingly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, it wouldn&lsquo;t,&rdquo; returned perverse Jo, &ldquo;I neither like, respect, nor admire Tudor,
            though his grandfather&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s nephew&rsquo;s niece was third cousin to a lord. Tommy is poor
            and bashful and good and very clever. I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman
            in spite of the brown-paper parcels.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use trying to argue with you,&rdquo; began Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not the least, my dear,&rdquo; interrupted Jo, &ldquo;so let us look amiable, and drop a card here, as
            the Kings are evidently out, for which I&rsquo;m deeply grateful.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and Jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching
            the fifth house, and being told that the young ladies were engaged.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today. We can run down there any time, and it&rsquo;s
            really a pity to trail through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself, if you please. Aunt likes to have us pay her the compliment of coming in style,
            and making a formal call; it&rsquo;s a little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don&rsquo;t
            believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them. Stoop
            down, and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What a good girl you are, Amy!&rdquo; said Jo, with a repentant glance from her own damaged costume to
            that of her sister, which was fresh and spotless still. &ldquo;I wish it was as easy for me to do little
            things to please people as it is for you. I think of them, but it takes too much time to do them; so I wait
            for a chance to confer a great favor, and let the small ones slip; but they tell best in the end, I
            fancy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air, &ldquo;Women should learn to be agreeable,
            particularly poor ones, for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you&rsquo;d
            remember that, and practice it, you&rsquo;d be better liked than I am, because there is more of you.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I&rsquo;m willing to own that you are right,
            only it&rsquo;s easier for me to risk my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when I don&rsquo;t
            feel like it. It&rsquo;s a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a greater not to be able to hide them. I don&rsquo;t mind saying that I don&rsquo;t approve
            of Tudor any more than you do, but I&rsquo;m not called upon to tell him so; neither are you, and there is
            no use in making yourself disagreeable because he is.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men, and how can they do it except by
            their manners? Preaching does not do any good, as I know to my sorrow, since I&rsquo;ve had Teddy to manage;
            but there are many little ways in which I can influence him without a word, and I say we ought to do it to
            others if we can.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can&rsquo;t be taken as a sample of other boys,&rdquo; said Amy, in a
            tone of solemn conviction, which would have convulsed the &ldquo;remarkable boy,&rdquo; if he had heard it.
            &ldquo;If we were belles, or women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps, but for us to
            frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don&rsquo;t approve of them, and smile upon another set
            because we do, wouldn&rsquo;t have a particle of effect, and we should only be considered odd and
            puritanical.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely because we are not belles and
            millionaires, are we? That&rsquo;s a nice sort of morality.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t argue about it, I only know that it&rsquo;s the way of the world, and people who set
            themselves against it only get laughed at for their pains. I don&rsquo;t like reformers, and I hope you will
            never try to be one.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of the laughing the world would never get on
            without them. We can&rsquo;t agree about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new: you will get
            on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should rather enjoy the
            brickbats<u><sup>ga</sup></u> and hooting, I think.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, compose yourself now, and don&rsquo;t worry Aunt with your new ideas.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to, but I&rsquo;m always possessed to burst out with some particularly blunt speech
            or revolutionary sentiment before her; it&rsquo;s my doom, and I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very interesting subject, but they dropped it
            as the girls came in, with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their nieces. Jo
            was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned, but Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her
            temper and pleased everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind. This amiable spirit was felt at once, and
            both the aunts &ldquo;my</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>deared&rdquo; her affectionately, looking what they afterward said emphatically, &ldquo;That child improves
            every day.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Are you going to help about the fair, dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy sat down beside her with
            the confiding air elderly people like so well in the young.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt. Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a table, as I have nothing but my
            time to give.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; put in Jo decidedly. &ldquo;I hate to be patronized, and the Chesters think
            it&rsquo;s a great favor to allow us to help with their highly connected fair. I wonder you consented, Amy,
            they only want you to work.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I am willing to work: it&rsquo;s for the freedmen<u><sup>gb</sup></u> as well as the Chesters, and I
            think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun. Patronage does not trouble me when it is
            well meant.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Quite right and proper. I like your grateful spirit, my dear; it&rsquo;s a pleasure to help people who
            appreciate our efforts: some do not, and that is trying,&rdquo; observed Aunt March, looking over her
            spectacles at Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance for one of them, she would have
            turned dovelike in a minute; but, unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t have windows in our breasts, and cannot see
            what goes on in the minds of our friends; better for us that we cannot as a general thing, but now and then
            it would be such a comfort, such a saving of time and temper. By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of
            several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave. I&rsquo;d rather do everything for
            myself, and be perfectly independent.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at
            Aunt March.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in the air, and a revolutionary aspect
            which was anything but inviting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you speak French, dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Carrol, laying her hand on Amy&rsquo;s.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often as I like,&rdquo; replied Amy,
            with a grateful look, which caused the old lady to smile affably.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How are you about languages?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know a word. I&rsquo;m very stupid about studying anything, can&rsquo;t bear French,
            it&rsquo;s such a slippery, silly sort of language,&rdquo; was the brusque reply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy, &ldquo;You are quite strong and well,
            now, dear, I believe? Eyes don&rsquo;t trouble you any more, do they?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not at all, thank you, ma&lsquo;am. I&rsquo;m very well, and mean to do great things next winter, so
            that I may be ready for Rome, whenever that joyful time arrives.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good girl! You deserve to go,
            and I&rsquo;m sure you will some day,&rdquo; said Aunt March, with an approving pat on the head, as Amy
            picked up her ball for her.</p>
        <p>Crosspatch,<u><sup>gc</sup></u> draw the latch,</p>
        <p>Sit by the fire and spin,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>squalled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to peep into Jo&rsquo;s face, with such
            a comical air of impertinent inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Most observing bird,&rdquo; said the old lady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Come and take a walk, my dear?&rdquo; cried Polly, hopping toward the china closet, with a look
            suggestive of lump sugar.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will. Come, Amy.&rdquo; And Jo brought the visit to an end, feeling more strongly than
            ever that calls did have a bad effect upon her constitution. She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but
            Amy kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the impression of shadow and
            sunshine, which impression caused Aunt March to say, as they vanished&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better do it, Mary, I&rsquo;ll supply the money,&rdquo; and Aunt Carrol to reply
            decidedly, &ldquo;I certainly will, if her father and mother consent.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>30</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Consequences</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. Chester&rsquo;s fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young
            ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the matter.
            Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at
            this period of her life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily. The
            &ldquo;haughty, uninteresting creature&rdquo; was let severely alone, but Amy&rsquo;s talent and taste were
            duly complimented by the offer of the art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate
            and valuable contributions to it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then there occurred one of the little
            skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young, with all
            their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself, and just at
            this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy&rsquo;s dainty pen-and-ink
            work entirely eclipsed May&rsquo;s painted vases&mdash;that was one thorn; then the all-conquering Tudor had
            danced four times with Amy at a late party and only once with May&mdash;that was thorn number two; but the
            chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave her an excuse for her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor
            which some obliging gossip had whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the
            Lambs&rsquo;. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her naughty imitation had been too
            lifelike to escape detection, and the frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape. No hint of this had
            reached the culprits, however, and Amy&rsquo;s dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before the
            fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the
            supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to anyone
            but my girls. As this is the most prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are the
            chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take this place. I&rsquo;m sorry, but I know
            you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have
            another table if you like.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. Chester had fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech, but when the time
            came, she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally, with Amy&rsquo;s unsuspicious eyes looking
            straight at her full of surprise and trouble.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and
            showing that she did, &ldquo;Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, my dear, don&rsquo;t have any ill feeling, I beg; it&rsquo;s merely a matter of expediency, you
            see; my girls will naturally take the lead, and this table is considered their proper place. I think it very
            appropriate to you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty; but we must give up our
            private wishes, of course, and I will see that you have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like the
            flower table? The little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged. You could make a charming thing of
            it, and the flower table is always attractive, you know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Especially to gentlemen,&rdquo; added May, with a look which enlightened Amy as to one cause of her
            sudden fall from favor. She colored angrily, but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered
            with unexpected amiability&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. I&rsquo;ll give up my place here at once, and attend to the
            flowers, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer,&rdquo; began May, feeling a little
            conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had
            so carefully made and so gracefully arranged. She meant it kindly, but Amy mistook her meaning, and said
            quickly&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly, if they are in your way&rdquo;; and sweeping her contributions into her apron,
            pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now she&rsquo;s mad. Oh, dear, I wish I hadn&rsquo;t asked you to speak, Mamma,&rdquo; said May,
            looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Girls&rsquo; quarrels are soon over,&rdquo; returned her mother, feeling a trifle ashamed of her own
            part in this one, as well she might.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which cordial reception somewhat soothed her
            perturbed spirit, and she fell to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically. But
            everything seemed against her: it was late, and she was tired; everyone was too busy with their own affairs
            to help her; and the little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many
            magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order. The
            evergreen arch wouldn&rsquo;t stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on
            her head when the hanging baskets were filled; her best tile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear
            on the Cupid&rsquo;s cheek; she bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a draft, which
            last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. Any girl reader who has suffered like
            afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through with her task.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening. Her mother said it was a shame, but
            told her she had done right, Beth declared she wouldn&rsquo;t go to the fair at all, and Jo demanded why she
            didn&rsquo;t take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Because they are mean is no reason why I should be. I hate such things, and though I think I&rsquo;ve
            a right to be hurt, I don&rsquo;t intend to show it. They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy
            actions, won&rsquo;t they, Marmee?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the right spirit, my dear; a kiss for a blow is always best, though it&rsquo;s not very
            easy to give it sometimes,&rdquo; said her mother, with the air of one who had learned the difference
            between preaching and practicing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate, Amy adhered to her resolution all the
            next day, bent on conquering her enemy by kindness. She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that came to
            her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her table that morning, while the little girls were
            in an anteroom filling the baskets, she took up her pet production&mdash;a little book, the antique cover of
            which her father had found among his treasures, and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully
            illuminated different texts. As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride, her
            eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue, and
            gold, with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers, were
            the words, &ldquo;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I ought, but I don&lsquo;t,&rdquo; thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright page to May&rsquo;s
            discontented face behind the big vases, that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled.
            Amy stood a minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings
            and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious
            ministers in street, school, office, or home; even a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>fair table may become a pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season.
            Amy&rsquo;s conscience preached her a little sermon from that text, then and there, and she did what many of
            us do not always do&mdash;took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A group of girls were standing about May&rsquo;s table, admiring the pretty things, and talking over the
            change of saleswomen. They dropped their voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of
            the story and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, but a better spirit had come over her, and presently
            a chance offered for proving it. She heard May say sorrowfully&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don&rsquo;t want to fill up with
            odds and ends. The table was just complete then: now it&rsquo;s spoiled.&rdquo; &ldquo;I dare say
            she&rsquo;d put them back if you asked her,&rdquo; suggested someone.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How could I after all the fuss?&rdquo; began May, but she did not finish, for Amy&rsquo;s voice came
            across the hall, saying pleasantly&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them. I was just thinking I&rsquo;d offer
            to put them back, for they belong to your table rather than mine. Here they are, please take them, and
            forgive me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile, and hurried away again, feeling that it
            was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, I call that lovely of her, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; cried one girl.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>May&rsquo;s answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was evidently a little soured by
            making lemonade, added, with a disagreeable laugh, &ldquo;Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn&rsquo;t sell
            them at her own table.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, that was hard; when we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated, at least; and for a
            minute Amy was sorry she had done it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is&mdash;as
            she presently discovered&mdash;for her spirits began to rise, and her table to blossom under her skillful
            hands, the girls were very kind, and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a very long day and a hard one to Amy, as she sat behind her table, often quite alone, for the little
            girls deserted very soon: few cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long before
            night.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The art table was the most attractive in the room; there was a crowd about it all day long, and the tenders
            were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes. Amy often looked wistfully
            across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do. It
            might seem no hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not only tedious, but very
            trying; and the thought of being found there in the evening by her family and Laurie and his friends made it
            a real martyrdom.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard
            one, though she made no complaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother gave her an extra
            cordial cup of tea, Beth helped her dress, and made a charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo
            astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the tables were about
            to be turned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything rude, pray, Jo. I won&rsquo;t have any fuss made, so let it all pass and
            behave yourself,&rdquo; begged Amy, as she departed early, hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to
            refresh her poor little table.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to everyone I know, and to keep them in your
            corner as long as possible. Teddy and his boys will lend a hand, and we&rsquo;ll have a good time
            yet,&rdquo; returned Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie. Presently the familiar tramp was heard
            in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is that my boy?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;As sure as this is my girl!&rdquo; And Laurie tucked her hand under his arm with the air of a man
            whose every wish was gratified.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Teddy, such doings!&rdquo; And Jo told Amy&rsquo;s wrongs with sisterly zeal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I don&rsquo;t
            make them buy every flower she&rsquo;s got, and camp down before her table afterward,&rdquo; said Laurie,
            espousing her cause with warmth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not arrive in time. I don&rsquo;t
            wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they never came at all. When people do one
            mean thing they are very likely to do another,&rdquo; observed Jo in a disgusted tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was poorly, I didn&rsquo;t like
            to worry him by asking, though I did want some.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking! They are just as much yours as mine.
            Don&rsquo;t we always go halves in everything?&rdquo; began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn
            thorny.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Gracious, I hope not! Half of some of your things wouldn&rsquo;t suit me at all. But we mustn&rsquo;t
            stand philandering here. I&rsquo;ve got to help Amy, so you go and make yourself splendid, and if
            you&rsquo;ll be so very kind as to let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I&rsquo;ll bless you
            forever.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you do it now?&rdquo; asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut the gate in his face
            with inhospitable haste, and called through the bars, &ldquo;Go away, Teddy, I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night, for Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers,
            with a lovely basket arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece; then the March family turned out en
            masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only came, but stayed, laughing at her
            nonsense, admiring Amy&rsquo;s taste, and apparently enjoying themselves very much. Laurie and his friends
            gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets, encamped before the table, and made that
            corner the liveliest spot in the room. Amy was in her element now, and, out of gratitude, if nothing more,
            was as sprightly and gracious as possible&mdash;coming to the conclusion, about that time, that virtue was
            its own reward, after all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was happily surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo
            circulated about the hall, picking up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the subject of the
            Chester change of base. She reproached herself for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate
            Amy as soon as possible; she also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and
            considered her a model of magnanimity. As she passed the art table, she glanced over it for her
            sister&rsquo;s things, but saw no signs of them. &ldquo;Tucked away out of sight, I dare say,&rdquo; thought
            Jo, who could forgive her own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered to her family.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Jo. How does Amy get on?&rdquo; asked May with a conciliatory air, for she wanted
            to show that she also could be generous.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is enjoying herself. The flower
            table is always attractive, you know, &lsquo;especially to gentlemen.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo couldn&rsquo;t resist giving that little slap, but May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after,
            and fell to praising the great vases, which still remained unsold.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is Amy&rsquo;s illumination anywhere about? I took a fancy to buy that for Father,&rdquo; said Jo,
            very anxious to learn the fate of her sister&rsquo;s work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Everything of Amy&rsquo;s sold long ago; I took care that the right people saw them, and they made a
            nice little sum of money for us,&rdquo; returned May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as
            Amy, that day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked both touched and surprised by the report
            of May&rsquo;s words and manner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by
            mine&mdash;especially the art table,&rdquo; she said, ordering out &ldquo;Teddy&rsquo;s Own,&rdquo; as the
            girls called the college friends.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Charge, Chester, charge!&rsquo; is the motto for that table, but do your duty like men, and
            you&rsquo;ll get your money&rsquo;s worth of art in every sense of the word,&rdquo; said the irrepressible
            Jo, as the devoted phalanx prepared to take the field.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May,&rdquo; said little Parker, making a frantic
            effort to be both witty and tender, and getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said, &ldquo;Very well, my
            son, for a small boy!&rdquo; and walked him off, with a paternal pat on the head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Buy the vases,&rdquo; whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals of fire on her
            enemy&rsquo;s head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To May&rsquo;s great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but pervaded the hall with one under
            each arm. The other gentlemen speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and wandered
            helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful
            and appropriate purchases.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said something to Mrs. March in a corner, which
            made the latter lady beam with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and anxiety,
            though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till several days later.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair was pronounced a success; and when May bade Amy good night, she did not gush as usual, but gave her
            an affectionate kiss, and a look which said, &ldquo;Forgive and forget.&rdquo; That satisfied Amy, and when
            she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each.
            &ldquo;The reward of merit for a magnanimous March,&rdquo; as Laurie announced with a flourish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character than I ever gave you
            credit for, Amy. You&rsquo;ve behaved sweetly, and I respect you with all my heart,&rdquo; said Jo warmly,
            as they brushed their hair together late that night.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive. It must have been dreadfully hard, after
            working so long and setting your heart on selling your own pretty things. I don&rsquo;t believe I could have
            done it as kindly as you did,&rdquo; added Beth from her pillow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, girls, you needn&rsquo;t praise me so. I only did as I&rsquo;d be done by. You laugh at me when I
            say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I
            know how. I can&rsquo;t explain exactly, but I want to be above the little meannesses and follies and faults
            that spoil so many women. I&rsquo;m far from it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what Mother
            is.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, &ldquo;I understand now what you mean, and I&rsquo;ll
            never laugh at you again. You are getting on faster than you think, and I&rsquo;ll take lessons of you in
            true politeness, for you&rsquo;ve learned the secret, I believe. Try away, deary, you&rsquo;ll get your
            reward some day, and no one will be more delighted than I shall.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be delighted. A letter came from Aunt
            Carrol, and Mrs. March&rsquo;s face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that Jo and Beth, who
            were with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Me to go with her!&rdquo; burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an uncontrollable rapture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, dear, not you; it&rsquo;s Amy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother! She&rsquo;s too young, it&rsquo;s my turn first. I&rsquo;ve wanted it so long&mdash;it
            would do me so much good, and be so altogether splendid&mdash;I must go.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
            it&rsquo;s impossible, Jo. Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a
            favor.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always so. Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn&rsquo;t fair,
            oh, it isn&rsquo;t fair!&rdquo; cried Jo passionately.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is partly your own fault, dear. When Aunt spoke to me the other day, she regretted
            your blunt manners and too independent spirit; and here she writes, as if quoting something you had
            said&mdash;&lsquo;I planned at first to ask Jo, but as &ldquo;favors burden her,&rdquo; and she &ldquo;hates
            French,&rdquo; I think I won&rsquo;t venture to invite her. Amy is more docile, will make a good companion
            for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the trip may give her.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! Why can&rsquo;t I learn to keep it quiet?&rdquo; groaned Jo,
            remembering words which had been her undoing. When she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs.
            March said sorrowfully&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time; so try to bear it cheerfully, and
            don&rsquo;t sadden Amy&rsquo;s pleasure by reproaches or regrets.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the basket she had joyfully
            upset. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a leaf out of her book, and try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not
            grudge her one minute of happiness; but it won&rsquo;t be easy, for it is a dreadful disappointment.&rdquo;
            And poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo, dear, I&rsquo;m very selfish, but I couldn&rsquo;t spare you, and I&rsquo;m glad you are not going
            quite yet,&rdquo; whispered Beth, embracing her, basket and all, with such a clinging touch and loving face
            that Jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears, and humbly beg
            Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how gratefully she would bear it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family jubilation, not quite as heartily as
            usual, perhaps, but without repinings at Amy&rsquo;s good fortune. The young lady herself received the news
            as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture, and began to sort her colors and pack her
            pencils that evening, leaving such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in
            visions of art than herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,&rdquo; she said impressively, as she scraped her
            best palette. &ldquo;It will decide my career, for if I have any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and
            will do something to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Suppose you haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new collars which were
            to be handed over to Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,&rdquo; replied the aspirant for fame, with
            philosophic composure; but she made a wry face at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent
            on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t. You hate hard work, and you&rsquo;ll marry some rich man, and come home to sit in
            the lap of luxury all your days,&rdquo; said Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don&rsquo;t believe that one will. I&rsquo;m sure I
            wish it would, for if I can&rsquo;t be an artist myself, I should like to be able to help those who
            are,&rdquo; said Amy, smiling, as if the part of Lady Bountiful<u><sup>gd</sup></u> would suit her better
            than that of a poor drawing teacher.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said Jo, with a sigh. &ldquo;If you wish it you&rsquo;ll have it, for your wishes are
            always granted&mdash;mine never.&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you like to go?&rdquo; asked Amy, thoughtfully patting
            her nose with her knife. &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, in a year or two I&rsquo;ll send for you, and we&rsquo;ll dig in the Forum for relics, and carry
            out all the plans we&rsquo;ve made so many times.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;ll remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes, if it ever does,&rdquo;
            returned Jo, accepting the vague but magnificent offer as gratefully as she could.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment till Amy was off. Jo bore up very
            well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried
            till she couldn&rsquo;t cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed; then, just as
            the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between
            her and those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last lingerer, saying with a sob&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should happen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I&rsquo;ll come and comfort you,&rdquo; whispered
            Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new and beautiful to young eyes, while her father
            and friend watched her from the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the
            happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling
            on the sea.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our Foreign Correspondent</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dearest people, LONDON</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel, Piccadilly. It&rsquo;s not a fashionable place, but
            Uncle stopped here years ago, and won&rsquo;t go anywhere else; however, we don&rsquo;t mean to stay long,
            so it&rsquo;s no great matter. Oh, I can&rsquo;t begin to tell you how I enjoy it all! I never can, so
            I&rsquo;ll only give you bits out of my notebook, for I&rsquo;ve done nothing but sketch and scribble since
            I started.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I sent a line from Halifax,<u><sup>ge</sup></u> when I felt pretty miserable, but after that I got on
            delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day, with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me. Everyone was very
            kind to me, especially the officers. Don&rsquo;t laugh, Jo, gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship,
            to hold on to, or to wait upon one; and as they have nothing to do, it&rsquo;s a mercy to make them useful,
            otherwise they would smoke themselves to death, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let alone, so when I had done what I could for them, I
            went and enjoyed myself. Such walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid air and waves! It was almost as
            exciting as riding a fast horse, when we went rushing on so grandly. I wish Beth could have come, it would
            have done her so much good; as for Jo, she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib, or whatever the
            high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and tooted on the captain&rsquo;s speaking trumpet,
            she&rsquo;d have been in such a state of rapture.</p>
        <p>It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and found it very lovely, so green and sunny,
            with brown cabins here and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen&rsquo;s countryseats in the
            valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It was early in the morning, but I didn&rsquo;t regret getting up
            to see it, for the bay was full of little boats, the shore so picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead. I never
            shall forget it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At Queenstown<u><sup>gf</sup></u> one of my new acquaintances left us&mdash;Mr. Lennox&mdash;and when I said
            something about the Lakes of Killarney, he sighed and sang, with a look at me&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, have you e&lsquo;er heard of Kate Kearney?</p>
        <p>She lives on the banks of Killarney;</p>
        <p>From the glance of her eye,</p>
        <p>Shun danger and fly,</p>
        <p>For fatal&rsquo;s the glance of Kate Kearney.&rdquo;<u><sup>gg</sup></u></p>
        <p>Wasn&rsquo;t that nonsensical?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours. It&rsquo;s a dirty, noisy place, and I was glad to leave it. Uncle
            rushed out and bought a pair of dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got shaved
            &agrave; la mutton chop,<u><sup>gh</sup></u> the first thing. Then he flattered himself that he looked like
            a true Briton, but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes, the little bootblack knew that an
            American stood in them, and said, with a grin, &ldquo;There yer har, sir. I&rsquo;ve give &lsquo;em the
            latest Yankee shine.&rdquo; It amused Uncle immensely. Oh, I must tell you what that absurd Lennox did! He
            got his friend Ward, who came on with us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my room
            was a lovely one, with &ldquo;Robert Lennox&rsquo;s compliments,&rdquo; on the card. Wasn&rsquo;t that fun,
            girls? I like traveling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I never shall get to London if I don&rsquo;t hurry. The trip was like riding through a long picture gallery,
            full of lovely landscapes. The farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs, ivy up to the eaves,
            latticed windows, and stout women with rosy children at the doors. The very cattle looked more tranquil than
            ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they never got nervous
            like Yankee biddies.<u><sup>gi</sup></u> Such perfect color I never saw&mdash;the grass so green, sky so
            blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark&mdash;1 was in a,rapture all the way. So was Flo, and we kept bouncing
            from one side to the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles
            an hour. Aunt was tired and went to sleep, but Uncle read his guidebook, and wouldn&rsquo;t be astonished at
            anything. This is the way we went on: Amy, flying up&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, that must be
            Kenilworth,<u><sup>gj</sup></u> that gray place among the trees!&rdquo; Flo, darting to my
            window&mdash;&ldquo;How sweet! We must go there some time, won&rsquo;t we, Papa?&rdquo; Uncle, calmly
            admiring his boots&mdash;&ldquo;No, my dear, not unless you want beer; that&rsquo;s a brewery.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A pause&mdash;then Flo cried out, &ldquo;Bless me, there&rsquo;s a gallows and a man going up.&rdquo;
            &ldquo;Where, where?&rdquo; shrieks Amy, staring out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling
            chains. &ldquo;A colliery,&rdquo;<u><sup>gk</sup></u> remarks Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye.
            &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a lovely flock of lambs all lying down,&rdquo; says Amy. &ldquo;See, Papa, aren&rsquo;t
            they pretty!&rdquo; added Flo sentimentally. &ldquo;Geese, young ladies,&rdquo; returns Uncle, in a tone
            that keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy The Flirtations of Capt. Cavendish, and I have the
            scenery all to myself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas. We rested,
            unpacked, and shopped a little between the showers. Aunt Mary got me some new things, for I came off in such
            a hurry I wasn&rsquo;t half ready. A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the loveliest
            mantle you ever saw. Shopping in Regent Street is perfectly splendid; things seem so cheap&mdash;nice
            ribbons only sixpence a yard. I laid in a stock, but shall get my gloves in Paris. Doesn&rsquo;t that sound
            sort of elegant and rich?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while Aunt and Uncle were out, and went for a drive,
            though we learned afterward that it wasn&rsquo;t the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone. It was so
            droll! for when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and told
            me to stop him. But he was up outside behind somewhere, and I couldn&rsquo;t get at him. He didn&rsquo;t
            hear me call, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite helpless, rattling away, and
            whirling around corners at a breakneck pace. At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on
            poking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now then, mum?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the door, with an &ldquo;Aye, aye, mum,&rdquo; the
            man made his horse walk, as if going to a funeral.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I poked again and said, &ldquo;A little faster,&rdquo; then off he went, helter-skelter as before, and we
            resigned ourselves to our fate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Today was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are more aristocratic than we look. The Duke of
            Devonshire lives near. I often see his footmen lounging at the back gate; and the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s
            house is not far off. Such sights as I saw, my dear! It was as good as Punch,<u><sup>gl</sup></u> for there
            were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches, with gorgeous Jeameses<u><sup>gm</sup></u>
            in silk stockings and velvet coats, up behind, and powdered coachmen in front. Smart maids, with the rosiest
            children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep, dandies in queer English hats and lavender
            kids<u><sup>gn</sup></u> lounging about, and tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on
            one side, looking so funny I longed to sketch them.</p>
        <p>Rotten Row means &ldquo;Route de Roi,&rdquo; or the king&rsquo;s way, but now it&rsquo;s more like a riding
            school than anything else. The horses are splendid, and the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>men, especially the grooms, ride well; but the women are stiff, and bounce, which isn&rsquo;t according to
            our rules. I longed to show them a tearing American gallop, for they trotted solemnly up and down, in their
            scant habits and high hats, looking like the women in a toy Noah&rsquo;s Ark. Everyone rides&mdash;old men,
            stout ladies, little children&mdash;and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, I saw a pair exchange
            rose buds, for it&rsquo;s the thing to wear one in the buttonhole, and I thought it rather a nice little
            idea.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the P.M. to Westminster Abbey, but don&rsquo;t expect me to describe it, that&rsquo;s impossible&mdash;so
            I&rsquo;ll only say it was sublime! This evening we are going to see Fechter,<u><sup>go</sup></u> which will
            be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life.</p>
        <p>MIDNIGHT</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s very late, but I can&rsquo;t let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened
            last evening. Who do you think came in, as we were at tea? Laurie&rsquo;s English friends, Fred and Frank
            Vaughn! I was so surprised, for I shouldn&rsquo;t have known them but for the cards. Both are tall fellows
            with whiskers, Fred handsome in the English style, and Frank much better, for he only limps slightly, and
            uses no crutches. They had heard from Laurie where we were to be, and came to ask us to their house; but
            Uncle won&rsquo;t go, so we shall return the call, and see them as we can. They went to the theater with us,
            and we did have such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and Fred and I talked over past,
            present, and future fun as if we had known each other all our days. Tell Beth Frank asked for her, and was
            sorry to hear of her ill health. Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo, and sent his &ldquo;respectful compliments
            to the big hat.&rdquo; Neither of them had forgotten Camp Laurence, or the fun we had there. What ages ago
            it seems, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I must stop. I really feel like a dissipated London fine
            lady, writing here so late, with my room full of pretty things, and my head a jumble of parks, theaters, new
            gowns, and gallant creatures who say &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and twirl their blond mustaches with the true English
            lordliness. I long to see you all, and in spite of my nonsense am, as ever, your loving</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>AMY</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>PARIS</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DEAR GIRLS,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In my last I told you about our London visit&mdash;how kind the Vaughns were, and what pleasant parties they
            made for us. I enjoyed the trips to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum<u><sup>gp</sup></u> more than
            anything else&mdash;for at Hampton I saw Raphael&rsquo;s cartoons, and, at the Museum, rooms full of
            pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth,<u><sup>10</sup></u> and the other great creatures. The day
            in Rich mond Park was charming, for we had a regular English picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups
            of deer than I could copy; also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up. We &ldquo;did&rdquo; London to our
            hearts&rsquo; content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry to go away; for though English people are
            slow to take you in, when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality, I
            think. The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter, and I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they
            don&lsquo;t, for Grace and I are great friends, and the boys very nice fellows&mdash;especially Fred.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again, saying he had come for a holiday, and was going
            to Switzerland. Aunt looked sober at first, but he was so cool about it she couldn&rsquo;t say a word; and
            now we get on nicely, and are very glad he came, for he speaks French like a native, and I don&rsquo;t know
            what we should do without him. Uncle doesn&rsquo;t know ten words, and insists on talking English very loud,
            as if that would make people understand him. Aunt&rsquo;s pronunciation is old-fashioned, and Flo and I,
            though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal, find we don&lsquo;t, and are very grateful to have
            Fred do the &ldquo;parley vooing,&rdquo;<u><sup>gq</sup></u> as Uncle calls it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Such delightful times as we are having! Sight-seeing from morning till night, stopping for nice lunches in
            the gay caf&eacute;s, and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures. Rainy days I spend in the Louvre,
            reveling in pictures. Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest, because she has no soul for
            art, but I have, and I&rsquo;m cultivating eye and taste as fast as I can. She would like the relics of
            great people better, for I&rsquo;ve seen her Napoleon&rsquo;s cocked hat and gray coat, his baby&rsquo;s
            cradle and his old toothbrush; also Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis,
            Charlemagne&rsquo;s sword,<u><sup>11</sup></u> and many other interesting things. I&rsquo;ll talk for hours
            about them when I come, but haven&rsquo;t time to write.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Palais Royale is a heavenly place&mdash;so full of bijouterie<u><sup>gr</sup></u> and lovely things that
            I&rsquo;m nearly distracted because I can&rsquo;t buy them. Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I
            didn&rsquo;t allow, it. Then the Bois and the Champs Elys&eacute;es are tr&egrave;s
            magnifique.<u><sup>gs</sup></u> I&rsquo;ve seen the imperial family<u><sup>12</sup></u> several
            times&mdash;the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the empress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, I
            thought&mdash;purple dress, green hat, and yellow gloves. Little Nap is a handsome boy, who sits chatting to
            his tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his four-horse barouche, with postilions in red
            satin jackets<u><sup>13</sup></u> and a mounted guard before and behind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely, though the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me
            better. P&egrave;re la Chaise is very curious, for many of the tombs are like small rooms, and looking in,
            one sees a table, with images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for the mourners to sit in when they come
            to lament. That is so Frenchy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and sitting on the balcony, we look up and down the long, brilliant
            street. It is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our day&rsquo;s work
            to go out. Fred is very entertaining, and is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever
            knew&mdash;except Laurie, whose manners are more charming. I wish Fred was dark, for I don&rsquo;t fancy
            light men, however, the Vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family, so I won&rsquo;t find fault
            with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland, and as we shall travel fast, I shall only be able to give
            you hasty letters. I keep my diary, and try to &ldquo;remember correctly and describe clearly all that I see
            and admire,&rdquo; as Father advised. It is good practice for me, and with my sketchbook will give you a
            better idea of my tour than these scribbles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Adieu, I embrace you tenderly.</p>
        <p>VOTRE AMIE<u><sup>gt</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>HEIDELBERG</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MY DEAR MAMMA,</p>
        <p>Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne,<u><sup>gu</sup></u> I&rsquo;ll try to tell you what has
            happened, for some of it is very important, as you will see.</p>
        <p>The sail up the Rhine<u><sup>gv</sup></u> was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed it with all my might. Get
            Father&rsquo;s old guidebooks and read about it, I haven&rsquo;t words beautiful enough to describe it. At
            Coblenz we had a lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with whom Fred got acquainted on the boat, gave
            us a serenade. It was a moonlight night, and about one o&lsquo;clock Flo and I were waked by the most
            delicious music under our windows. We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed us Fred and
            the students singing away down below. It was the most romantic thing I ever saw&mdash;the river, the bridge
            of boats, the great fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of stone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them scramble for them, kiss their hands to the
            invisible ladies, and go laughing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>away&mdash;to smoke and drink beer, I suppose. Next morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his
            vest pocket, and looked very sentimental. I laughed at him, and said I didn&rsquo;t throw it, but Flo, which
            seemed to disgust him, for he tossed it out of the window, and turned sensible again. I&rsquo;m afraid
            I&rsquo;m going to have trouble with that boy, it begins to look like it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden,<u><sup>gw</sup></u> where Fred lost some money, and I
            scolded him. He needs someone to look after him when Frank is not with him. Kate said once she hoped
            he&rsquo;d marry soon, and I quite agree with her that it would be well for him. Frankfurt was delightful; I
            saw Goethe&lsquo;s<u><sup>gx</sup></u> house, Schiller&rsquo;s statue, and Dannecker&rsquo;s famous
            Ariadne.<u><sup>14</sup></u> It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it more if I had known the story
            better. I didn&rsquo;t like to ask, as everyone knew it or pretended they did. I wish Jo would tell me all
            about it; I ought to have read more, for I find I don&rsquo;t know anything, and it mortifies me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now comes the serious part&mdash;for it happened here, and Fred is just gone. He has been so kind and jolly
            that we all got quite fond of him, I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the serenade
            night. Since then I&rsquo;ve begun to feel that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures
            were something more to him than fun. I haven&rsquo;t flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what you said to
            me, and have done my very best. I can&rsquo;t help it if people like me; I don&rsquo;t try to make them, and
            it worries me if I don&rsquo;t care for them, though Jo says I haven&rsquo;t got any heart. Now I know
            Mother will shake her head, and the girls say, &ldquo;Oh, the mercenary little wretch!&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve
            made up my mind, and, if Fred asks me, I shall accept him, though I&rsquo;m not madly in love. I like him,
            and we get on comfortably together. He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich&mdash;ever so much
            richer than the Laurences. I don&rsquo;t think his family would object, and I should be very happy, for they
            are all kind, well-bred, generous people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the estate,
            I suppose, and such a splendid one as it is! A city house in a fashionable street, not so showy as our big
            houses, but twice as comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people believe in. I like it, for
            it&rsquo;s genuine. I&rsquo;ve seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the
            country place, with its park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be all I should
            ask! And I&rsquo;d rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily, and find nothing behind.
            I may be mercenary, but I hate poverty, and don&rsquo;t mean to bear it a minute longer than I can help. One
            of us must marry well; Meg didn&lsquo;t, Jo won&rsquo;t, Beth can&rsquo;t yet, so I shall, and make
            everything cozy all round. I wouldn&rsquo;t marry a man I hated or despised. You may be sure of that; and
            though Fred is not my model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond enough of him if he was
            very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So I&rsquo;ve been turning the matter over in my mind the
            last week, for it was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing, but little things
            showed it; he never goes with Flo, always gets on my side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks
            sentimental when we are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me. Yesterday at dinner,
            when an Austrian officer stared at us and then said something to his friend&mdash;a rakish-looking
            baron&mdash;about &ldquo;ein wondersch&ouml;nes Bl&ouml;ndchen,&rdquo;<u> <sup>gy</sup></u> Fred looked as
            fierce as a lion, and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate. He isn&rsquo;t one of the cool,
            stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might guess from his bonnie
            blue eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset&mdash;at least all of us but Fred, who was to meet
            us there after going to the Post Restante<u><sup>gz</sup></u> for letters. We had a charming time poking
            about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun<u><sup>ha</sup></u> is, and the beautiful gardens made by
            the elector long ago for his English wife.<u><sup>15</sup></u> I liked the great terrace best, for the view
            was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone
            lion&rsquo;s head on the wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt as if I&rsquo;d got
            into a romance, sitting there, watching the Neckar<u><sup>hb</sup></u> rolling through the valley, listening
            to the music of the Austrian band below, and waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl. I had a
            feeling that something was going to happen and I was ready for it. I didn&rsquo;t feel blushy or quakey, but
            quite cool and only a little excited.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By-and-by I heard Fred&rsquo;s voice, and then he came hurrying through the great arch to find me. He looked
            so troubled that I forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was. He said he&rsquo;d just got a
            letter begging him to come home, for Frank was very ill; so he was going at once on the night train and only
            had time to say good-by. I was very sorry for him, and disappointed for myself, but only for a minute
            because he said, as he shook hands&mdash;and said it in a way that I could not mistake&mdash;&ldquo;I shall
            soon come back, you won&rsquo;t forget me, Amy?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I didn&rsquo;t promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied, and there was no time for anything but
            messages and good-bys, for he was off in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know he wanted to speak,
            but I think, from something he once hinted, that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort
            yet a while, for he is a rash boy, and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughter-in-law. We shall soon
            meet in Rome, and then, if I don&rsquo;t change my mind, I&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; when
            he says &ldquo;Will you, please?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of course this is all very private, but I wished you to know what was going on. Don&rsquo;t be anxious about
            me, remember I am your &ldquo;prudent Amy,&rdquo; and be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as much
            advice as you like, I&rsquo;ll use it if I can. I wish I could see you for a good talk, Marmee. Love and
            trust me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ever your AMY</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>32</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tender Troubles</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo, I&rsquo;m anxious about Beth.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, Mother, she has seemed unusually well since the babies came.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not her health that troubles me now, it&rsquo;s her spirits. I&rsquo;m sure there is
            something on her mind, and I want you to discover what it is.&rdquo; &ldquo;What makes you think so,
            Mother?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She sits alone a good deal, and doesn&rsquo;t talk to her father as much as she used. I found her
            crying over the babies the other day. When she sings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see
            a look in her face that I don&rsquo;t understand. This isn&rsquo;t like Beth, and it worries me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Have you asked her about it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I have tried once or twice, but she either evaded my questions or looked so distressed that I stopped.
            I never force my children&rsquo;s confidence, and I seldom have to wait for it long.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret
            disquietude but Beth&lsquo;s, and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said, &ldquo;I think she is
            growing up, and so begins to dream dreams, and have hopes and fears and fidgets, without knowing why or
            being able to explain them. Why, Mother, Beth&rsquo;s eighteen, but we don&rsquo;t realize it, and treat her
            like a child, forgetting she&rsquo;s a woman.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So she is. Dear heart, how fast you do grow up,&rdquo; returned her mother with a sigh and a smile.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all sorts of worries, and let your birds
            hop out of the nest, one by one. I promise never to hop very far, if that is any comfort to you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It is a great comfort, Jo, I always feel strong when you are at home, now Meg is gone. Beth is too
            feeble and Amy too young to depend upon, but when the tug comes, you are always ready.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, you know I don&rsquo;t mind hard jobs much, and there must always be one scrub in a family. Amy
            is splendid in fine works and I&rsquo;m not, but I feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken
            up, or half the family fall sick at once. Amy is distinguishing herself abroad, but if anything is amiss at
            home, I&rsquo;m your man.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her tender little heart to her Jo sooner than to
            anyone else. Be very kind, and don&rsquo;t let her think anyone watches or talks about her. If she only
            would get quite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn&rsquo;t have a wish in the world.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Happy woman! I&rsquo;ve got heaps.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My dear, what are they?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle Bethy&rsquo;s troubles, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you mine. They are not very
            wearing, so they&rsquo;ll keep.&rdquo; And Jo stitched away, with a wise nod which set her mother&rsquo;s
            heart at rest about her for the present at least.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth, and after many conflicting conjectures,
            finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her. A slight incident gave Jo the clue to
            the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did the rest. She was affecting to write busily one
            Saturday afternoon, when she and Beth were alone together; yet as she scribbled, she kept her eye on her
            sister, who seemed unusually quiet. Sitting at the window, Beth&rsquo;s work often dropped into her lap, and
            she leaned her head upon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the dull, autumnal
            landscape. Suddenly some one passed below, whistling like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out,
            &ldquo;All serene! Coming in tonight.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by till his quick tramp died away, then
            said softly as if to herself, &ldquo;How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said Jo, still intent upon her sister&rsquo;s face, for the bright color faded as quickly
            as it came, the smile vanished, and presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge. Beth whisked it off
            and glanced apprehensively at Jo; but she was scratching away at a tremendous rate, apparently engrossed in
            Olympia&rsquo;s Oath. The instant Beth turned, Jo began her watch again, saw Beth&rsquo;s hand go quietly to
            her eyes more than once, and in her half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill.
            Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring something about needing more paper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!&rdquo; she said, sitting down in her own room, pale with the shock of
            the discovery which she believed she had just made. &ldquo;I never dreamed of such a thing. What will Mother
            say? I wonder if he&mdash;&rdquo; There Jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought. &ldquo;If he
            shouldn&rsquo;t love back again, how dreadful it would be. He must. I&rsquo;ll make him!&rdquo; And she
            shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.
            &ldquo;Oh dear, we are growing up with a vengeance. Here&rsquo;s Meg married and a mamma, Amy flourishing
            away at Paris, and Beth in love. I&rsquo;m the only one that has sense enough to keep out of
            mischief.&rdquo; Jo thought intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed out
            her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face opposite, &ldquo;No thank you, sir,
            you&rsquo;re very charming, but you&rsquo;ve no more stability than a weathercock; so you needn&rsquo;t
            write touching notes and smile in that insinuating way, for it won&rsquo;t do a bit of good, and I
            won&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to
            take new observations, which only confirmed her suspicion. Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked with Jo,
            his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle, but so was everybody&rsquo;s; therefore, no
            one thought of imagining that he cared more for her than for the others. Indeed, a general impression had
            prevailed in the family of late that &ldquo;our boy&rdquo; was getting fonder than ever of Jo, who, however,
            wouldn&rsquo;t hear a word upon the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. If they had
            known the various tender passages of the past year, or rather attempts at tender passages which had been
            nipped in the bud, they would have had the immense satisfaction of saying, &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; But
            Jo hated &ldquo;philandering,&rdquo; and wouldn&rsquo;t allow it, always having a joke or a smile ready at
            the least sign of impending danger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month; but these small flames were as brief
            as ardent, did no damage, and much amused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope, despair,
            and resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly conferences. But there came a time when Laurie
            ceased to worship at many shrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged occasionally in
            Byronic<u><sup>hc</sup></u> fits of gloom. Then he avoided the tender subject altogether, wrote
            philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious, and gave out that he was going to &ldquo;dig,&rdquo; intending
            to graduate in a blaze of glory. This suited the young lady better than twilight confidences, tender
            pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the eye, for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and
            she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be shut up in the
            tin kitchen till called for, and the latter were less manageable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo watched Laurie that night as she had
            never done before. If she had not got the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in the
            fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her. But having given the rein to her lively fancy,
            it galloped away with her at a great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course of
            romance writing, did not come to the rescue. As usual Beth lay on the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair
            close by, amusing her with all sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly &ldquo;spin,&rdquo; and he
            never disappointed her. But that evening Jo fancied that Beth&rsquo;s eyes rested on the lively, dark face
            beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she listened with intense interest to an account of some
            exciting cricket match, though the phrases, &ldquo;caught off a tice,&rdquo; &ldquo;stumped off his
            ground,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the leg hit for three,&rdquo; were as intelligible to her as Sanskrit. She also
            fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it, that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in
            Laurie&rsquo;s manner, that he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a little
            absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth&rsquo;s feet with an assiduity that was really almost
            tender.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Who knows? Stranger things have happened,&rdquo; thought Jo, as she fussed about the room. &ldquo;She
            will make quite an angel of him, and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they
            only love each other. I don&rsquo;t see how he can help it, and I do believe he would if the rest of us were
            out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all
            speed. But where should she go? And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she sat
            down to settle that point.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa&mdash;long, broad, well-cushioned, and low; a trifle
            shabby, as well it might be, for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back,
            rode on the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested tired heads, dreamed dreams, and
            listened to tender talk on it as young women. They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner
            had always been Jo&rsquo;s favorite lounging place. Among the many pillows that adorned the venerable couch
            was one, hard, round, covered with prickly horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end; this
            repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon of defense, a barricade, or a stern
            preventive of too much slumber.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep aversion, having been unmercifully
            pummeled with it in former days when romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from taking the
            seat he most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner. If &ldquo;the sausage&rdquo; as they called it, stood on
            end, it was a sign that he might approach and repose; but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to the man,
            woman, or child who dared disturb it! That evening Jo forgot to barricade her corner, and had not been in
            her seat five minutes, before a massive form appeared beside her, and, with both arms spread over the sofa
            back, both long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of satisfaction&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, this is filling at the price.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No slang,&rdquo; snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow. But it was too late, there was no room for it,
            and coasting onto the floor, it disappeared in a most mysterious manner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Come, Jo, don&rsquo;t be thorny. After studying himself to a skeleton all the week, a fellow deserves
            petting and ought to get it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Beth will pet you, I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not to be bothered with me; but you like that sort of thing, unless you&rsquo;ve
            suddenly lost your taste for it. Have you? Do you hate your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard, but Jo quenched &ldquo;her boy&rdquo;
            by turning on him with the stern query, &ldquo;How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not one, upon my word. She&rsquo;s engaged. Now then.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it, that&rsquo;s one of your foolish extravagances&mdash;sending flowers and things
            to girls for whom you don&rsquo;t care two pins,&rdquo; continued Jo reprovingly. &ldquo;Sensible girls for
            whom I do care whole papers of pins won&rsquo;t let me send them &lsquo;flowers and things,&rsquo; so what
            can I do? My feelings must have a went.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother doesn&rsquo;t approve of flirting even in fun,
            and you do flirt desperately, Teddy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give anything if I could answer, &lsquo;So do you.&rsquo; As I can&lsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll
            merely say that I don&rsquo;t see any harm in that pleasant little game, if all parties understand that
            it&rsquo;s only play.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, it does look pleasant, but I can&rsquo;t learn how it&rsquo;s done. I&rsquo;ve tried, because
            one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else is doing, but I don&rsquo;t seem to get on,&rdquo;
            said Jo, forgetting to play mentor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far. I suppose it&rsquo;s natural to some
            people to please without trying, and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you can&rsquo;t flirt; it&rsquo;s really refreshing to see a sensible, straightforward
            girl, who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of herself. Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls I
            know really do go on at such a rate I&rsquo;m ashamed of them. They don&rsquo;t mean any harm, I&rsquo;m
            sure, but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward, they&rsquo;d mend their ways, I
            fancy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest, you fellows get the worst of it, for you are
            as silly as they, every bit. If you behaved properly, they would; but, knowing you like their nonsense, they
            keep it up, and then you blame them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Much you know about it, ma&lsquo;am,&rdquo; said Laurie in a superior tone. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like
            romps and flirts, though we may act as if we did sometimes. The pretty, modest girls are never talked about,
            except respectfully, among gentlemen. Bless your innocent soul! If you could be in my place for a month
            you&rsquo;d see things that would astonish you a trifle. Upon my word, when I see one of those harum-scarum
            girls, I always want to say with our friend Cock Robin&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Out upon you, fie upon you,</p>
        <p>Bold-faced jig!&rdquo;<u><sup>hd</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between Laurie&rsquo;s chivalrous reluctance to
            speak ill of womankind, and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society
            showed him many samples. Jo knew that &ldquo;young Laurence&rdquo; was regarded as a most eligible
            parti<u><sup>he</sup></u> by worldly mammas, was much smiled upon by their daughters, and flattered enough
            by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb<u><sup>hf</sup></u> of him; so she watched him rather jealously,
            fearing he would be spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest
            girls. Returning suddenly to her admonitory tone, she said, dropping her voice, &ldquo;If you must have a
            &lsquo;went,&rsquo; Teddy, go and devote yourself to one of the &lsquo;pretty, modest girls&rsquo; whom you
            do respect, and not waste your time with the silly ones.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You really advise it?&rdquo; And Laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in
            his face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, but you&rsquo;d better wait till you are through college, on the whole, and be fitting
            yourself for the place meantime. You&rsquo;re not half good enough for &mdash;well, whoever the modest girl
            may be.&rdquo; And Jo looked a little queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of humility quite new to him, as he
            dropped his eyes and absently wound Jo&rsquo;s apron tassel round his finger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mercy on us, this will never do,&rdquo; thought Jo, adding aloud, &ldquo;Go and sing to me. I&rsquo;m
            dying for some music, and always like yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather stay here, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, you can&lsquo;t, there isn&rsquo;t room. Go and make yourself useful, since you are too big to
            be ornamental. I thought you hated to be tied to a woman&rsquo;s apron string?&rdquo; retorted Jo, quoting
            certain rebellious words of his own.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!&rdquo; and Laurie gave an audacious tweak at the tassel.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo; demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He fled at once, and the minute it was well &ldquo;Up with the bonnets of bonnie
            Dundee,&rdquo;<u><sup>hg</sup></u> she slipped away to return no more till the young gentleman had departed
            in high dudgeon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to
            Beth&rsquo;s bedside, with the anxious inquiry, &ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought you were asleep,&rdquo; sobbed Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is it the old pain, my precious?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a new one, but I can bear it.&rdquo; And Beth tried to check her tears.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did the other.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You can&lsquo;t, there is no cure.&rdquo; There Beth&rsquo;s voice gave way, and clinging to her
            sister, she cried so despairingly that Jo was frightened. &ldquo;Where is it? Shall I call Mother?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>Beth did not answer the first question, but in the dark one hand went involuntarily to her heart as if the
            pain were there, with the other she held Jo fast, whispering eagerly, &ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t call her,
            don&rsquo;t tell her. I shall be better soon. Lie down here and &lsquo;poor&rsquo; my head. I&rsquo;ll be
            quiet and go to sleep, indeed I will. &rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth&rsquo;s hot forehead and wet eyelids, her heart
            was very full and she longed to speak. But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers,
            cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally; so though she believed she knew the cause of Beth&rsquo;s
            new pain, she only said, in her tenderest tone, &ldquo;Does anything trouble you, deary?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Jo,&rdquo; after a long pause.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it comfort you to tell me what it is?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not now, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t ask, but remember, Bethy, that Mother and Jo are always glad to hear and help you,
            if they can.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know it. I&rsquo;ll tell you by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is the pain better now?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Go to sleep, dear, I&rsquo;ll stay with you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth seemed quite herself again, for at eighteen
            neither heads nor hearts ache long, and a loving word can medicine most ills.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Jo had made up her mind, and after pondering over a project for some days, she confided it to her mother.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You asked me the other day what my wishes were. I&rsquo;ll tell you one of them, Marmee,&rdquo; she
            began, as they sat alone together. &ldquo;I want to go away somewhere this winter for a change.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, Jo?&rdquo; And her mother looked up quickly, as if the words suggested a double meaning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly, &ldquo;I want something new. I feel restless and anxious to be
            seeing, doing, and learning more than I am. I brood too much over my own small affairs, and need stirring
            up, so as I can be spared this winter, I&rsquo;d like to hop a little way and try my wings.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where will you hop?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;To New York. I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it. You know Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some
            respectable young person to teach her children and sew. It&rsquo;s rather hard to find just the thing, but I
            think I should suit if I tried.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My dear, go out to service in that great boardinghouse!&rdquo; And Mrs. March looked surprised, but
            not displeased.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is your friend&mdash;the kindest soul that
            ever lived&mdash;and would make things pleasant for me, I know. Her family is separate from the rest, and no
            one knows me there. Don&rsquo;t care if they do. It&rsquo;s honest work, and I&rsquo;m not ashamed of
            it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nor I. But your writing?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;All the better for the change. I shall see and hear new things, get new ideas, and, even if I
            haven&rsquo;t much time there, I shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, Mother.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;May I know the others?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden color in her cheeks, &ldquo;It may be vain and
            wrong to say it, but&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;Laurie is getting too fond of me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care for you?&rdquo; And Mrs.
            March looked anxious as she put the question.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mercy, no! I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am immensely proud of him, but as for anything
            more, it&rsquo;s out of the question.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that, Jo.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, please?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Because, dear, I don&rsquo;t think you are suited to one another. As friends you are very happy, and
            your frequent quarrels soon blow over, but I fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life. You are
            too much alike and too fond of freedom, not to mention hot tempers and strong wills, to get on happily
            together, in a relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance, as well as love.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the feeling I had, though I couldn&rsquo;t express it. I&rsquo;m glad you think he
            is only beginning to care for me. It would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn&rsquo;t fall
            in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are sure of his feeling for you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The color deepened in Jo&rsquo;s cheeks as she answered, with the look of mingled pleasure, pride, and pain
            which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is so, Mother; he
            hasn&rsquo;t said anything, but he looks a great deal. I think I had better go away before it comes to
            anything.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo looked relieved, and, after a pause, said, smiling, &ldquo;How Mrs. Moffat would wonder at your want of
            management, if she knew, and how she will rejoice that Annie still may hope.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the hope is the same in all&mdash;the desire to
            see their children happy. Meg is so, and I am content with her success. You I leave to enjoy your liberty
            till you tire of it, for only then will you find that there is something sweeter. Amy is my chief care now,
            but her good sense will help her. For Beth, I indulge no hopes except that she may be well. By the way, she
            seems brighter this last day or two. Have you spoken to her?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me by-and-by. I said no more, for I think I
            know it.&rdquo; And Jo told her little story.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic a view of the case, but looked grave, and repeated
            her opinion that for Laurie&rsquo;s sake Jo should go away for a time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled, then I&rsquo;ll run away before he can
            collect his wits and be tragic. Beth must think I&rsquo;m going to please myself, as I am, for I can&rsquo;t
            talk about Laurie to her; but she can pet and comfort him after I&rsquo;m gone, and so cure him of this
            romantic notion. He&rsquo;s been through so many little trials of the sort, he&rsquo;s used to it, and will
            soon get over his lovelornity.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear that this &ldquo;little trial&rdquo;
            would be harder than the others, and that Laurie would not get over his &ldquo;lovelornity&rdquo; as easily
            as heretofore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon, for Mrs. Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised
            to make a pleasant home for her. The teaching would render her independent, and such leisure as she got
            might be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable. Jo
            liked the prospect and was eager to be gone, for the home nest was growing too narrow for her restless
            nature and adventurous spirit. When all was settled, with fear and trembling she told Laurie, but to her
            surprise he took it very quietly. He had been graver than usual of late, but very pleasant, and when
            jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly, &ldquo;So I am, and I mean this one shall
            stay turned.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then, and made her preparations
            with a lightened heart&mdash;for Beth seemed more cheerful&mdash;and hoped she was doing the best for all.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;One thing I leave to your especial care,&rdquo; she said, the night before she left.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You mean your papers?&rdquo; asked Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, my boy. Be very good to him, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course I will, but I can&rsquo;t fill your place, and he&rsquo;ll miss you sadly.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt him; so remember, I leave him in your charge, to plague, pet, and keep in
            order.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, for your sake,&rdquo; promised Beth, wondering why Jo looked at
            her so queerly.</p>
        <p>When Laurie said good-by, he whispered significantly, &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do a bit of good, Jo. My eye is
            on you, so mind what you do, or I&rsquo;ll come and bring you home.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Jo&rsquo;s Journal</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DEAR MARMEE AND BETH, NEW YORK, NOVEMBER</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m going to write you a regular volume, for I&rsquo;ve got heaps to tell, though I&rsquo;m not a fine
            young lady traveling on the continent. When I lost sight of Father&rsquo;s dear old face, I felt a trifle
            blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or
            less, hadn&rsquo;t diverted my mind; for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every
            time they opened their mouths to roar.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my
            heart.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even in that big house full of strangers. She gave
            me a funny little sky parlor <u><sup>hh</sup></u>&mdash;all she had, but there is a stove in it, and a nice
            table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like. A fine view and a church tower
            opposite atone for the many stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery, where I am to
            teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke&rsquo;s private parlor, and the two little girls are
            pretty children&mdash;rather spoiled, I fancy, but they took to me after telling them The Seven Bad Pigs,
            and I&rsquo;ve no doubt I shall make a model governess.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the great table, and for the present I do, for I
            am bashful, though no one will believe it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, my dear, make yourself at home,&rdquo; said Mrs. K. in her motherly way, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the
            drive from morning to night, as you may suppose with such a family, but a great anxiety will be off my mind
            if I know the children are safe with you. My rooms are always open to you, and your own shall be as
            comfortable as I can make it. There are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable, and your
            evenings are always free. Come to me if anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can. There&rsquo;s the
            tea bell, I must run and change my cap.&rdquo; And off she bustled, leaving me to settle myself in my new
            nest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As I went downstairs soon after, I saw something I liked. The flights are very long in this tall house, and
            as I stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up, I saw a gentleman
            come along behind her, take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put it down at a
            door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod and a foreign accent, &ldquo;It goes better so. The
            little back is too young to haf such heaviness.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Wasn&rsquo;t it good of him? I like such things, for, as Father says, trifles show character. When I
            mentioned it to Mrs. K., that evening, she laughed, and said, &ldquo;That must have been Professor Bhaer,
            he&rsquo;s always doing things of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin, very learned and good, but poor as a church mouse, and gives lessons to
            support himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according to the wishes of his
            sister, who married an American. Not a very romantic story, but it interested me, and I was glad to hear
            that Mrs. K. lends him her parlor for some of his scholars. There is a glass door between it and the
            nursery, and I mean to peep at him, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you how he looks. He&rsquo;s almost forty, so
            it&rsquo;s no harm, Marmee.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I attacked the big workbasket, and had a quiet evening
            chatting with my new friend. I shall keep a journal-letter, and send it once a week; so good night, and more
            tomorrow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tuesday Eve</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Had a lively time in my seminary this morning, for the children acted like Sancho, and at one time I really
            thought I should shake them all round. Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics, and I kept it up till
            they were glad to sit down and keep still. After luncheon, the girl took them out for a walk, and I went to
            my needlework like little Mabel<u><sup>hi</sup></u> &ldquo;with a willing mind.&rdquo; I was thanking my
            stars that I&rsquo;d learned to make nice buttonholes, when the parlor door opened and shut, and someone
            began to hum, like a big bumblebee. It was dreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn&rsquo;t resist the
            temptation, and lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door, I peeped in. Professor Bhaer was
            there, and while he arranged his books, I took a good look at him. A regular German&mdash;rather stout, with
            brown hair tumbled all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I ever saw, and a splendid
            big voice that does one&rsquo;s ears good, after our sharp or slipshod American gabble.<u><sup>hk</sup></u>
            His clothes were rusty, his hands were large, and he hadn&rsquo;t a really handsome feature in his face,
            except his beautiful teeth; yet I liked him, for he had a fine head, his linen was very nice, and he looked
            like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe. He looked sober in
            spite of his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the
            cat, who received him like an old friend. Then he smiled, and when a tap came at the door, called out in a
            loud, brisk tone,</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Kennst du das Land,&rdquo;<u><sup>hj</sup></u></p>
        <p>&ldquo;Herein!&rdquo;<u><sup>hl</sup></u></p>
        <p>I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book, and stopped to see
            what was going on.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Me wants my Bhaer,&rdquo; said the mite, slamming down her book and running to meet him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer; come, then, and take a goot hug from him, my Tina,&rdquo; said the
            Professor, catching her up with a laugh, and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop her
            little face to kiss him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now me mus tuddy my lessin,&rdquo; went on the funny little thing; so he put her up at the table,
            opened the great dictionary she had brought, and gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled away,
            turning a leaf now and then, and passing her little fat finger down the page, as if finding a word, so
            soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh, while Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a
            fatherly look that made me think she must be his own, though she looked more French than German.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work, and there I virtuously remained
            through all the noise and gabbling that went on next door. One of the girls kept laughing affectedly, and
            saying &ldquo;Now Professor,&rdquo; in a coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an accent
            that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Both seemed to try his patience sorely, for more than once I heard him say emphatically, &ldquo;No, no, it is
            not so, you haf not attend to what I say,&rdquo; and once there was a loud rap, as if he struck the table
            with his book, followed by the despairing exclamation, &ldquo;Prut! It all goes bad this day.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Poor man, I pitied him, and when the girls were gone, took just one more peep to see if he survived it. He
            seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock
            struck two, when he jumped up, put his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and, taking
            little Tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms, he carried her quietly away. I fancy he has a
            hard life of it. Mrs. Kirke</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>asked me if I wouldn&rsquo;t go down to the five o&lsquo;clock dinner, and feeling a little bit homesick, I
            thought I would, just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me. So I made myself
            respectable and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as she is short and I&rsquo;m tall, my efforts at
            concealment were rather a failure. She gave me a seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I plucked up
            courage and looked about me. The long table was full, and everyone intent on getting their dinner&mdash;the
            gentlemen especially, who seemed to be eating on time, for they bolted in every sense of the word, vanishing
            as soon as they were done. There was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves, young couples
            absorbed in each other, married ladies in their babies, and old gentlemen in politics. I don&rsquo;t think I
            shall care to have much to do with any of them, except one sweet-faced maiden lady, who looks as if she had
            something in her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor, shouting answers to the questions of a very
            inquisitive, deaf old gentleman on one side, and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other. If Amy
            had been here, she&rsquo;d have turned her back on him forever because, sad to relate, he had a great
            appetite, and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified &ldquo;her ladyship.&rdquo; I
            didn&rsquo;t mind, for I like &ldquo;to see folks eat with a relish,&rdquo; as Hannah says, and the poor man
            must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.</p>
        <p>As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were settling their hats before the hall mirror, and I
            heard one say low to the other, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the new party?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Governess, or something of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What the deuce is she at our table for?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Friend of the old lady&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Handsome head, but no style.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. Give us a light and come on.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I felt angry at first, and then I didn&rsquo;t care, for a governess is as good as a clerk, and I&rsquo;ve
            got sense, if I haven&rsquo;t style, which is more than some people have, judging from the remarks of the
            elegant beings who clattered away, smoking like bad chimneys. I hate ordinary people!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thursday</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and writing to my little room, which is very cozy, with
            a light and fire. I picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the Professor. It seems that Tina is
            the child of the Frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here. The little thing has lost her
            heart to Mr. Bhaer, and follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home, which delights him,
            as he is very fond of children, though a &ldquo;bachel dore.&rdquo; Kitty and Minnie Kirke likewise regard
            him with affection, and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings, and
            the splendid tales he tells. The young men quiz him, it seems, call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa
            Major,<u><sup>hm</sup></u> and make all manner of jokes on his name. But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. K.
            says, and takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him in spite of his foreign ways.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The maiden lady is a Miss Norton&mdash;rich, cultivated, and kind. She spoke to me at dinner today (For I
            went to table again, it&rsquo;s such fun to watch people), and asked me to come and see her at her room. She
            has fine books and pictures, knows interesting persons, and seems friendly, so I shall make myself
            agreeable, for I do want to get into good society, only it isn&rsquo;t the same sort that Amy likes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was in our parlor last evening when Mr. Bhaer came in with some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke. She wasn&rsquo;t
            there, but Minnie, who is a little old woman, introduced me very prettily: &ldquo;This is Mamma&rsquo;s
            friend, Miss March.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, and she&rsquo;s jolly and we like her lots,&rdquo; added Kitty, who is an enfant
            terrible.<u><sup>hn</sup></u></p>
        <p>We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction and the blunt addition were rather a comical
            contrast.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch. If so again, call at me and I
            come,&rdquo; he said, with a threatening frown that delighted the little wretches.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I promised I would, and he departed; but it seems as if I was doomed to see a good deal of him, for today as
            I passed his door on my way out, by accident I knocked against it with my umbrella. It flew open, and there
            he stood in his dressing gown, with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other; he
            didn&rsquo;t seem at all ashamed of it, for when I explained and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and
            all, saying in his loud, cheerful way&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You haf a fine day to make your walk. Bon voyage, mademoiselle. &rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic, also to think of the poor man having to mend
            his own clothes. The German gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning hose is another thing and not so
            pretty.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Saturday</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss Norton, who has a room full of lovely things, and
            who was very charming, for she showed me all her treasures, and asked me if I would sometimes go with her to
            lectures and concerts, as her escort&mdash;if I enjoyed them. She put it as a favor, but I&rsquo;m sure Mrs.
            Kirke has told her about us, and she does it out of kindness to me. I&rsquo;m as proud as Lucifer, but such
            favors from such people don&rsquo;t burden me, and I accepted gratefully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor that I looked in, and there was Mr.
            Bhaer down on his hands and knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him with a jump rope, and Minnie
            feeding two small boys with seedcakes,<u><sup>ho</sup></u> as they roared and ramped in cages built of
            chairs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We are playing nargerie,&rdquo; explained Kitty.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dis is mine effalunt!&rdquo; added Tina, holding on by the Professor&rsquo;s hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon, when Franz and Emil come, doesn&rsquo;t
            she, Mr. Bhaer?&rdquo; said Minnie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The &ldquo;effalunt&rdquo; sat up, looking as much in earnest as any of them, and said soberly to me,
            &ldquo;I gif you my wort it is so. If we make too large a noise you shall say Hush! to us, and we go more
            softly.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I promised to do so, but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much as they did&mdash;for a more glorious
            frolic I never witnessed. They played tag and soldiers, danced and sang, and when it began to grow dark they
            all piled onto the sofa about the Professor, while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on the
            chimney tops, and the little &ldquo;kobolds,&rdquo;<u><sup>hp</sup></u> who ride the snowflakes as they
            fall. I wish Americans were as simple and natural as Germans, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if motives of economy didn&rsquo;t stop me; for
            though I&rsquo;ve used thin paper and written fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will
            need. Pray forward Amy&rsquo;s as soon as you can spare them. My small news will sound very flat after her
            splendors, but you will like them, I know. Is Teddy studying so hard that he can&rsquo;t find time to write
            to his friends? Take good care of him for me, Beth, and tell me all about the babies, and give heaps of love
            to everyone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From your faithful Jo</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>P.S. On reading over my letter it strikes me as rather Bhaery, but I am always interested in odd people, and
            I really had nothing else to write about. Bless you!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>DECEMBER</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MY PRECIOUS BETSEY,</p>

        <p>As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to you, for it may amuse you, and give you some idea
            of my goings on; for though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh, be joyful! After what Amy would
            call Herculaneum<u><sup>hq</sup></u> efforts, in the way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas
            begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish. They are not so interesting to me as Tina and
            the boys, but I do my duty by them, and they are fond of me. Franz and Emil are jolly little lads, quite
            after my own heart, for the mixture of German and American spirit in them produces a constant state of
            effervescence. Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether spent in the house or out, for on pleasant
            days they all go to walk, like a seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep order, and then such fun!
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We are very good friends now, and I&rsquo;ve begun to take lessons. I really couldn&rsquo;t help it, and it
            all came about in such a droll way that I must tell you. To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke called to me
            one day as I passed Mr. Bhaer&rsquo;s room where she was rummaging.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Did you ever see such a den, my dear? Just come and help me put these books to rights, for I&rsquo;ve
            turned everything upside down, trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs I gave him
            not long ago.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it was &ldquo;a den,&rdquo; to be sure. Books and
            papers everywhere; a broken meerschaum,<u><sup>hr</sup></u> and an old flute over the mantelpiece as if done
            with; a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other;
            half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts; dirty little boots stood drying before the
            fire; and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave of himself, were to be seen all over
            the room. After a grand rummage three of the missing articles were found&mdash;one over the bird cage, one
            covered with ink, and a third burned brown, having been used as a holder.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Such a man!&rdquo; laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the relics in the rag bag. &ldquo;I
            suppose the others are torn up to rig ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite tails. It&rsquo;s dreadful,
            but I can&rsquo;t scold him: he&rsquo;s so absent-minded and good-natured, he lets those boys ride over him
            roughshod. I agreed to do his washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his things and I forget to
            look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Let me mend them,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind it, and he needn&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;d
            like to&mdash;he&rsquo;s so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two pairs of the socks&mdash;for they were boggled out
            of shape with his queer darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn&rsquo;t find it out, but one day last
            week he caught me at it. Hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that I
            took a fancy to learn, for Tina runs in and out, leaving the door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting
            near this door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar, who is
            as stupid as I am. The girl had gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was busily gabbling
            over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was
            Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to Tina not to betray him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, &ldquo;you peep at me, I peep at you, and
            that is not bad; but see, I am not pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, but you are too busy. I am too stupid to learn,&rdquo; I blundered out, as red as a peony.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Prut! we will make the time, and we fail not to find the sense. At efening I shall gif a little lesson
            with much gladness; for, look you, Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay.&rdquo; And he pointed to my work.
            &ldquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; they say to one another, these so kind ladies, &lsquo;he is a stupid old fellow,
            he will see not what we do, he will never opserve that his sock heels go not in holes any more, he will
            think his buttons grow out new when they fall, and believe that strings make theirselves.&rsquo; Ah! But I
            haf an eye, and I see much. I haf a heart, and I feel the thanks for this. Come, a little lesson then and
            now, or no more good fairy works for me and mine.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of course I couldn&rsquo;t say anything after that, and as it really is a splendid opportunity, I made the
            bargain, and we began. I took four lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog. The Professor was
            very patient with me, but it must have been torment to him, and now and then he&rsquo;d look at me with such
            an expression of mild despair that it was a toss-up with me whether to laugh or cry. I tried both ways, and
            when it came to a sniff of utter mortification and woe, he just threw the grammar on to the floor and
            marched out of the room. I felt myself disgraced and deserted forever, but didn&rsquo;t blame him a
            particle, and was scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard, when in he
            came, as brisk and beaming as if I&rsquo;d covered myself with glory.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now we shall try a new way. You and I will read these pleasant little M&auml;rchen<u><sup>hs</sup></u>
            together, and dig no more in that dry book, that goes in the corner for making us trouble.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Andersen&rsquo;s fairy tales so invitingly before me, that I was more
            ashamed than ever, and went at my lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to amuse him immensely. I
            forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away (no other word will express it) with all my might, tumbling over long
            words, pronouncing according to the inspiration of the minute, and doing my very best. When I finished
            reading my first page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and cried out, in his hearty way,
            &ldquo;Das ist gut! Now we go well! My turn. I do him in German, gif me your ear.&rdquo; And away he went,
            rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as hear. Fortunately
            the story was the Constant Tin Soldier,<u><sup>ht</sup></u> which is droll, you know, so I could
            laugh&mdash;and I did&mdash;though I didn&rsquo;t understand half he read, for I couldn&rsquo;t help it, he
            was so earnest, I so excited, and the whole thing so comical.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty well, for this way of studying suits me, and I
            can see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly. I like it very
            much, and he doesn&rsquo;t seem tired of it yet&mdash;which is very good of him, isn&rsquo;t it? I mean to
            give him something on Christmas, for I dare not offer money. Tell me something nice, Marmee.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up smoking and lets his hair grow. You see
            Beth manages him better than I did. I&rsquo;m not jealous, dear, do your best, only don&rsquo;t make a saint
            of him. I&rsquo;m afraid I couldn&rsquo;t like him without a spice of human naughtiness. Read him bits of my
            letters. I haven&rsquo;t time to write much, and that will do just as well. Thank Heaven Beth continues so
            comfortable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JANUARY</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course includes Mr. L. and a young man by the name
            of Teddy. I can&rsquo;t tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn&rsquo;t get it till
            night and had given up hoping. Your letter came in the morning, but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning
            it for a surprise; so I was disappointed, for I&rsquo;d had a &ldquo;kind of a feeling&rdquo; that you
            wouldn&rsquo;t forget me. I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in my room after tea, and when the big,
            muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I just hugged it and pranced. It was so homey and
            refreshing that I sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried, in my usual
            absurd way. The things were just what I</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>wanted, and all the better for being made instead of bought. Beth&rsquo;s new &ldquo;ink bib&rdquo; was
            capital, and Hannah&rsquo;s box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure. I&rsquo;ll be sure and wear the nice
            flannels <u><sup>hu</sup></u> you sent, Marmee, and read carefully the books Father has marked. Thank you
            all, heaps and heaps!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Speaking of books reminds me that I&rsquo;m getting rich in that line, for on New Year&rsquo;s Day Mr. Bhaer
            gave me a fine Shakespeare. It is one he values much, and I&rsquo;ve often admired it, set up in the place
            of honor with his German Bible, Plato, Homer,<u><sup>hv</sup></u> and Milton; so you may imagine how I felt
            when he brought it down, without its cover, and showed me my name in it, &ldquo;from my friend Friedrich
            Bhaer.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You say often you wish a library: here I gif you one, for between these lids (he meant covers) is many
            books in one. Read him well, and he will help you much, for the study of character in this book will help
            you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about &ldquo;my library,&rdquo; as if I had a hundred books. I
            never knew how much there was in Shakespeare before, but then I never had a Bhaer to explain it to me. Now
            don&rsquo;t laugh at his horrid name; it isn&rsquo;t pronounced either Bear or Beer, as people will say it,
            but something between the two, as only Germans can give it. I&rsquo;m glad you both like what I tell you
            about him, and hope you will know him some day. Mother would admire his warm heart, Father his wise head. I
            admire both, and feel rich in my new &ldquo;friend Friedrich Bhaer.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Not having much money, or knowing what he&rsquo;d like, I got several little things, and put them about the
            room, where he would find them unexpectedly. They were useful, pretty, or funny&mdash;a new standish&Dagger;
            on his table, a little vase for his flower&mdash;he always has one, or a bit of green in a glass, to keep
            him fresh, he says&mdash;and a holder for his blower, so that he needn&rsquo;t burn up what Amy calls
            &ldquo;mouchoirs.&rdquo;<u><sup>hw</sup></u> I made it like those Beth invented&mdash;a big butterfly with a
            fat body, and black and yellow wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes. It took his fancy immensely, and he
            put it on his mantelpiece as an article of virtu,<u><sup>hx</sup></u> so it was rather a failure after all.
            Poor as he is, he didn&rsquo;t forget a servant or a child in the house, and not a soul here, from the
            French laundrywoman to Miss Norton, forgot him. I was so glad of that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year&rsquo;s Eve. I didn&rsquo;t mean to go down, having no
            dress; but at the last minute, Mrs. Kirke remembered some old brocades, and Miss Norton lent me lace and
            feathers; so I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop, and sailed in with a mask on. No one knew me, for I disguised my
            voice, and no one dreamed of the silent, haughty Miss March (for they think I am very stiff and cool, most
            of them, and so I am to whippersnappers) could dance and dress, and burst out into a &ldquo;nice derangement
            of epitaphs, like an allegory on the banks of the Nile.&rdquo; I enjoyed it very much, and when we unmasked
            it was fun to see them stare at me. I heard one of the young men tell another that he knew I&rsquo;d been an
            actress; in fact, he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters. Meg will relish that
            joke. Mr. Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was Titania<u><sup>hy</sup></u>&mdash;a perfect little fairy in
            his arms. To see them dance was &ldquo;quite a landscape,&rdquo; to use a Teddyism.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had a very happy New Year, after all; and when I thought it over in my room, I felt as if I was getting on
            a little in spite of my many failures; for I&rsquo;m cheerful all the time now, work with a will, and take
            more interest in other people than I used to, which is satisfactory. Bless you all!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ever your loving Jo</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>34</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A Friend</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread
            and made it sweeter for the effort, Jo still found time for literary labors. The purpose which now took
            possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl, but the means she took to gain her end
            were not the best. She saw that money conferred power: money and power, therefore, she resolved to have, not
            to be used for herself alone, but for those whom she loved more than self.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth everything she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an
            organ in her bedroom, going abroad herself, and always having more than enough, so that she might indulge in
            the luxury of charity, had been for years Jo&rsquo;s most cherished castle in the air.</p>
        <p>The prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might, after long traveling and much uphill work,
            lead to this delightful ch&acirc;teau en Espagne.<u><sup>hz</sup></u> But the novel disaster quenched her
            courage for a time, for public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on bigger
            beanstalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she reposed awhile after the first attempt, which resulted in
            a tumble and the least lovely of the giant&rsquo;s treasures, if I remember rightly. But the &ldquo;up again
            and take another&rdquo; spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack, so she scrambled up on the shady side this
            time and got more booty, but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark ages, even all-perfect America read rubbish. She
            told no one, but concocted a &ldquo;thrilling tale,&rdquo; and boldly carried it herself to Mr.
            Dashwood,<u><sup>ia</sup></u> editor of the Weekly Volcano. She had never read Sartor
            Resartus,<u><sup>ib</sup></u> but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful
            over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. So she dressed herself in her best, and
            trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and
            dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of cigar smoke, and the presence of three
            gentlemen, sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of them took
            the trouble to remove on her appearance. Somewhat daunted by this reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold,
            murmuring in much embarrassment&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office. I wished to see Mr. Dashwood.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Down went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest gentleman, and carefully cherishing his cigar
            between his fingers, he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep. Feeling that
            she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her manuscript and, blushing redder and redder with
            each sentence, blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A friend of mine desired me to offer&mdash;a story&mdash;just as an experiment&mdash;would like your
            opinion&mdash;be glad to write more if this suits.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript, and was turning over the leaves with
            a pair of rather dirty fingers, and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a first attempt, I take it?&rdquo; observing that the pages were numbered, covered only on one
            side, and not tied up with a ribbon&mdash;sure sign of a novice. &ldquo;No, sir; she has had some
            experience, and got a prize for a tale in the Blameystone Banner.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, did she?&rdquo; And Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to take note of everything she
            had on, from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots. &ldquo;Well, you can leave it, if you like.
            We&rsquo;ve more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present, but I&rsquo;ll run
            my eye over it, and give you an answer next week.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, Jo did not like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn&rsquo;t suit her at all; but, under the
            circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away, looking particularly tall and
            dignified, as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both, for it was perfectly
            evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of &ldquo;my
            friend&rdquo; was considered a good joke; and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as
            he closed the door, completed her discomfiture. Half resolving never to return, she went home, and worked
            off her irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously, and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over
            the scene and long for next week.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced; Mr. Dashwood was much wider awake than
            before, which was agreeable; and Mr. Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his
            manners: so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take this (editors never say I), if you don&rsquo;t object to a few alterations.
            It&rsquo;s too long, but omitting the passages I&rsquo;ve marked will make it just the right length,&rdquo;
            he said, in a businesslike tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo hardly knew her own MS.<u><sup>ic</sup></u> again, so crumpled and underscored were its pages and
            paragraphs, but feeling as a tender parent might on being asked to cut off her baby&rsquo;s legs in order
            that it might fit into a new cradle, she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find that all
            the moral reflections&mdash;which she had carefully put in as ballast for much
            romance<u><sup>id</sup></u>&mdash;had been stricken out.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But, sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a moral, so I took care to have a few of my
            sinners repent.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Dashwood&rsquo;s editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo had forgotten her &ldquo;friend,&rdquo;
            and spoken as only an author could.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;People want to be amused, not preached at, you know. Morals don&rsquo;t sell nowadays;&rdquo; which
            was not quite a correct statement, by the way. &ldquo;You think it would do with these alterations,
            then?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a new plot, and pretty well worked up&mdash;language good, and so on,&rdquo; was Mr.
            Dashwood&rsquo;s affable reply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What do you&mdash;that is, what compensation&mdash;&rdquo; began Jo, not exactly knowing how to
            express herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this sort. Pay when it comes
            out,&rdquo; returned Mr. Dashwood, as if that point had escaped him; such trifles often do escape the
            editorial mind, it is said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Very well, you can have it,&rdquo; said Jo, handing back the story with a satisfied air, for after the
            dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five seemed good pay.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this?&rdquo; asked Jo,
            unconscious of her little slip of the tongue, and emboldened by her success.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll look at it; can&rsquo;t promise to take it. Tell her to make it short and spicy, and
            never mind the moral. What name would your friend like to put to it? &rdquo; in a careless tone.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;None at all, if you please, she doesn&rsquo;t wish her name to appear and has no nom de
            plume,&rdquo;<u><sup>ie</sup></u> said Jo, blushing in spite of herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Just as she likes, of course. The tale will be out next week. Will you call for the money, or shall I
            send it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dashwood, who felt a natural desire</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>to know who his new contributor might be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call. Good morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful remark, &ldquo;Poor and proud, as usual, but
            she&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Following Mr. Dashwood&rsquo;s directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her model, Jo rashly took a plunge into
            the frothy sea of sensational literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend, she came
            up again not much the worse for her ducking.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters and scenery; and banditti, counts, gypsies,
            nuns, and duchesses appeared upon her stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit as
            could be expected. Her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar, punctuation, and
            probability, and Mr. Dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not
            thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks,
            on being offered higher wages, had basely left him in the lurch.</p>
        <p>She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew stout, and the little hoard she was
            making to take Beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. One thing
            disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell them at home. She had a feeling that Father
            and Mother would not approve, and preferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon afterward. It was easy
            to keep her secret, for no name appeared with her stories; Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out very
            soon, but promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word.</p>
        <p>She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she should be ashamed,
            and quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings
            and laugh over her well-kept secret.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as thrills could not be produced except by harrowing
            up the souls of the readers, history and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and lunatic
            asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose. Jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but
            few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in a business light, she set about
            supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy. Eager to find material for stories, and bent on
            making them original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers for accidents,
            incidents, and crimes; she excited the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on poisons; she
            studied faces in the street, and characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her; she delved in the
            dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as good as new, and introduced herself to
            folly, sin, and misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed. She thought she was prospering finely,
            but unconsciously she was beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman&rsquo;s
            character. She was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its influence affected her, for she
            was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the innocent bloom
            from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life, which comes soon enough to all of
            us.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of other people&rsquo;s passions and
            feelings set her to studying and speculating about her own&mdash;a morbid amusement in which healthy young
            minds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings its own punishment, and when Jo most needed hers,
            she got it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read character, or the natural instinct of
            a woman for what was honest, brave, and strong; but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every
            perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who interested her in spite of many human
            imperfections. Mr. Bhaer, in one of their conversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and lovely
            characters, wherever she found them, as good training for a writer. Jo took him at his word, for she coolly
            turned round and studied him&mdash;a proceeding which would have much surprised him, had he known it, for
            the worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first. He was neither rich nor great, young nor handsome; in
            no respect what is called fascinating, imposing, or brilliant; and yet he was as attractive as a genial
            fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth. He was poor, yet always
            appeared to be giving something away; a stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer young, but as
            happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face looked beautiful to many, and his oddities were
            freely forgiven for his sake. Jo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and at last decided that
            it was benevolence which worked the miracle. If he had any sorrow, &ldquo;it sat with its head under its
            wing,&rdquo; and he turned only his sunny side to the world. There were lines upon his forehead, but Time
            seemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to others. The pleasant curves about his
            mouth were the memorials of many friendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never cold or hard, and his
            big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than words.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the wearer. They looked as if they were at
            ease, and liked to make him comfortable; his capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart underneath;
            his rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty
            and came out full; his very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy like other
            people&rsquo;s.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that genuine good will
            toward one&rsquo;s fellow men could beautify and dignify even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his
            dinner, darned his own socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect, and a little
            discovery which she made about the Professor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself,
            and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for learning and
            integrity, till a country-man came to see him, and in a conversation with Miss Norton divulged the pleasing
            fact. From her Jo learned it, and liked it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it. She felt
            proud to know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor language-master in America; and
            his homely, hard-working life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner. Miss Norton had the
            entree into literary society, which Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her. The solitary woman
            felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on Jo and the
            Professor. She took them with her one night to a select symposium, held in honor of several celebrities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar
            off. But her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to recover
            from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all. Imagine her dismay, on
            stealing a glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on
            &ldquo;spirit, fire, and dew,&rdquo;<u><sup>if</sup></u> to behold him devouring his supper with an ardor
            which flushed his intellectual countenance. Turning as from a fallen idol, she made other discoveries which
            rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions. The great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the
            regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly with one of the Madame de Sta&euml;ls of the age,
            who looked daggers at another Corinne,<u><sup>ig</sup></u> who was amiably satirizing her, after
            outmaneuvering her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea
            Johnsonianly<u><sup>ih</sup></u> and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady rendering speech
            impossible. The scientific celebrities, forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about art,
            while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young musician, who was
            charming the city like a second Orpheus,<u><sup>ii</sup></u> talked horses; and the specimen of the British
            nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely desillusionn&eacute;e,<u><sup>ij</sup></u> that she
            sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined her, looking rather out of his element, and
            presently several of the philosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an intellectual
            tournament in the recess. The conversation was miles beyond Jo&rsquo;s comprehension, but she enjoyed it,
            though Kant and Hegel were unknown gods, the</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms,<u><sup>16</sup></u> and the only thing &ldquo;evolved from her
            inner consciousness&rdquo; was a bad headache after it was all over. It dawned upon her gradually that the
            world was being picked to pieces, and put together on new and, according to the talkers, on infinitely
            better principles than before, that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and
            intellect was to be the only God. Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any sort, but a curious
            excitement, half pleasurable, half painful, came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned
            adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a holiday.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him looking at her with the grimmest expression
            she had ever seen him wear. He shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she was fascinated just
            then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy,<u><sup>ik</sup></u> and kept her seat, trying to find out
            what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions, not because they were unsettled, but
            too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken. As he glanced from Jo to several other young people, attracted
            by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit his brows and longed to speak, fearing that some
            inflammable young soul would be led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over that they had
            only an empty stick or a scorched hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed to for an opinion, he blazed up with honest
            indignation and defended religion with all the eloquence of truth&mdash;an eloquence which made his broken
            English musical and his plain face beautiful. He had a hard fight, for the wise men argued well, but he
            didn&rsquo;t know when he was beaten and stood to his colors like a man. Somehow, as he talked, the world
            got right again to Jo; the old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed better than the new; God was not a
            blind force, and immortality was not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact. She felt as if she had solid ground
            under her feet again; and when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but not one whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her
            hands and thank him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She did neither; but she remembered this scene, and gave the Professor her heartiest respect, for she knew it
            cost him an effort to speak out then and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent. She
            began to see that character is a better possession than money, rank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that
            if greatness is what a wise man has defined it to be, &ldquo;truth, reverence, and good will,&rdquo; then
            her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This belief strengthened daily. She valued his esteem, she coveted his respect, she wanted to be worthy of
            his friendship; and just when the wish was sincerest, she came near losing everything. It all grew out of a
            cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his
            head, which Tina had put there and he had forgotten to take off.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s evident he doesn&rsquo;t look in his glass before coming down,&rdquo; thought Jo, with a
            smile, as he said, &ldquo;Good efening,&rdquo; and sat soberly down, quite unconscious of the ludicrous
            contrast between his subject and his headgear, for he was going to read her the Death of Wallenstein.
            <u><sup>il</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big, hearty laugh when anything funny
            happened, so she left him to discover it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for to hear a
            German read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation. After the reading came the lesson, which was a
            lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that night, and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment.
            The Professor didn&rsquo;t know what to make of her, and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise
            that was irresistible&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master&rsquo;s face? Haf you no respect for me, that you go
            on so bad?&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I be respectful, sir, when you forget to take your hat off?&rdquo; said Jo.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat,
            looked at it a minute, and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah! I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my cap. Well, it is nothing; but see
            you, if this lesson goes not well, you too shall wear him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr. Bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat,
            and unfolding it, said with an air of great disgust, &ldquo;I wish these papers did not come in the house,
            they are not for children to see, nor young people to read. It is not well, and I haf no patience with those
            who make this harm.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a
            viper. She did not like it, but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but fear,
            because for a minute she fancied the paper was the Volcano. It was not, however, and her panic subsided as
            she remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no name to
            betray her. She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a blush, for though an absent man, the
            Professor saw a good deal more than people fancied. He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the
            newspaper offices more than once; but as she never spoke of it, he asked no questions in spite of a strong
            desire to see her work. Now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it
            troubled him. He did not say to himself, &ldquo;It is none of my business, I&rsquo;ve no right to say
            anything,&rdquo; as many people would have done; he only remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far
            away from mother&rsquo;s love and father&rsquo;s care; and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick
            and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle. All this
            flashed through his mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face; and by the time the paper
            was turned, and Jo&rsquo;s needle threaded, he was ready to say quite naturally, but very gravely&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, you are right to put it from you. I do not like to think that good young girls should see such
            things. They are made pleasant to some, but I would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than
            this bad trash.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a demand for it, I don&rsquo;t see any harm
            in supplying it. Many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation
            stories,&rdquo; said Jo, scratching gathers<u><sup>im</sup></u> so energetically that a row of little slits
            followed her pin.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care to sell it. If the respectable people
            knew what harm they did, they would not feel that the living was honest. They haf no right to put poison in
            the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it. No, they should think a little, and sweep mud in the street
            before they do this thing.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in his hands. Jo sat still, looking as if
            the fire had come to her, for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone
            harmlessly up the chimney.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I should like much to send all the rest after him,&rdquo; muttered the Professor, coming back with a
            relieved air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her hard-earned money lay rather heavily
            on her conscience at that minute. Then she thought consolingly to herself, &ldquo;Mine are not like that,
            they are only silly, never bad, so I won&rsquo;t be worried,&rdquo; and taking up her book, she said, with a
            studious face, &ldquo;Shall we go on, sir? I&rsquo;ll be very good and proper now.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shall hope so,&rdquo; was all he said, but he meant more than she imagined, and the grave, kind look
            he gave her made her feel as if the words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her forehead.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully reread every one of her stories. Being
            a little shortsighted, Mr. Bhaer sometimes used eyeglasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling to see how
            they magnified the fine print of her book; now she seemed to have got on</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the Professor&rsquo;s mental or moral spectacles also, for the faults of these poor stories glared at her
            dreadfully and filled her with dismay.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They are trash, and will soon be worse than trash if I go on, for each is more sensational than the
            last. I&rsquo;ve gone blindly on, hurting myself and other people, for the sake of money. I know it&rsquo;s
            so, for I can&rsquo;t read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it, and what should
            I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of them?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove, nearly setting the chimney afire
            with the blaze.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I&rsquo;d better burn the house down,
            I suppose, than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder,&rdquo; she thought as she watched the
            Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But when nothing remained of all her three months&rsquo; work except a heap of ashes and the money in her
            lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think I haven&rsquo;t done much harm yet, and may keep this to pay for my time,&rdquo; she said,
            after a long meditation, adding impatiently, &ldquo;I almost wish I hadn&rsquo;t any conscience, it&rsquo;s
            so inconvenient. If I didn&rsquo;t care about doing right, and didn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable when doing
            wrong, I should get on capitally. I can&rsquo;t help wishing sometimes, that Father and Mother hadn&rsquo;t
            been so particular about such things.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that &ldquo;Father and Mother were particular,&rdquo; and pity
            from your heart those who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like
            prison walls to impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon in womanhood.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation, but
            going to the other extreme, as is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs. Sherwood
            <u><sup>in</sup></u> Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More,<u><sup>io</sup></u> and then produced a tale which
            might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so intensely moral was it. She had her doubts
            about it from the beginning, for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style
            as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century. She sent this
            didactic gem to several markets, but it found no purchaser, and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood
            that morals didn&rsquo;t sell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then she tried a child&rsquo;s story, which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary
            enough to demand filthy lucre for it. The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try
            juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his
            particular belief. But much as she liked to write for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her
            naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did not go to a particular Sabbath
            school, nor all the good infants who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to
            escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues. So nothing
            came of these trials, and Jo corked up her inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humility&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything; I&rsquo;ll wait till I do before I try again, and, meantime, &lsquo;sweep
            mud in the street,&rsquo; if I can&rsquo;t do better; that&rsquo;s honest, at least;&rdquo; which decision
            proved that her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had been as busy and uneventful as usual,
            and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer. He did it so
            quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by his reproof; but she
            stood the test, and he was satisfied, for though no words passed between them, he knew that she had given up
            writing. Not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky,
            but she spent her evenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and studied with a
            dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something useful, if not
            pleasant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was happy, for while her pen lay idle, she
            was learning other lessons besides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her own life.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs. Kirke till June. Everyone seemed sorry
            when the time came; the children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer&rsquo;s hair stuck straight up all over
            his head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Going home? Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in,&rdquo; he said, when she told him, and sat
            silently pulling his beard in the corner, while she held a little levee on that last evening.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was going early, so she bade them all good-by overnight; and when his turn came, she said warmly,
            &ldquo;Now, sir, you won&rsquo;t forget to come and see us, if you ever travel our way, will you? I&rsquo;ll
            never forgive you if you do, for I want them all to know my friend.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you? Shall I come?&rdquo; he asked, looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not
            see. &ldquo;Yes, come next month. Laurie graduates then, and you&rsquo;d enjoy Commencement as something
            new.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is your best friend, of whom you speak?&rdquo; he said in an altered tone.
            &ldquo;Yes, my boy Teddy. I&rsquo;m very proud of him and should like you to see him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one
            another. Something in Mr. Bhaer&rsquo;s face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more than
            a &ldquo;best friend,&rdquo; and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the
            matter, she involuntarily began to blush, and the more she tried not to, the redder she grew. If it had not
            been for Tina on her knee, she didn&rsquo;t know what would have become of her. Fortunately the child was
            moved to hug her, so she managed to hide her face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he
            did, and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression, as he said
            cordially&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much success, and you all happiness.
            Gott bless you!&rdquo; And with that, he shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire with the tired look on his face and the
            &ldquo;heimweh,&rdquo; or homesickness, lying heavy at his heart. Once, when he remembered Jo as she sat
            with the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face, he leaned his head on his hands a
            minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in search of something that he could not find.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It is not for me, I must not hope it now,&rdquo; he said to himself, with a sigh that was almost a
            groan; then, as if reproaching himself for the longing that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two
            tousled heads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened his Plato.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He did his best and did it manfully, but I don&rsquo;t think he found that a pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or
            even the divine Plato, were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child and home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Early as it was, he was at the station next morning to see Jo off; and, thanks to him, she began her solitary
            journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets to keep her
            company, and, best of all, the happy thought, &ldquo;Well, the winter&rsquo;s gone, and I&rsquo;ve written
            no books, earned no fortune, but I&rsquo;ve made a friend worth having and I&rsquo;ll try to keep him all my
            life.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>35</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Heartache</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose that year, for he graduated with honor,
            and gave the Latin oration with the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a
            Demosthenes,<u><sup>ip</sup></u> so his friends said. They were all there, his grandfather&mdash;oh, so
            proud!&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him with the sincere
            admiration which boys make light of at the time, but fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early tomorrow. You&rsquo;ll
            come and meet me as usual, girls?&rdquo; Laurie said, as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys
            of the day were over. He said &ldquo;girls,&rdquo; but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up the
            old custom; she had not the heart to refuse her splendid, successful boy anything, and answered
            warmly&mdash;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you, playing &lsquo;Hail the conquering hero
            comes,&rsquo;<u><sup>iq</sup></u> on a jew&lsquo;s-harp.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic, &ldquo;Oh, deary me! I know he&rsquo;ll
            say something, and then what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and having decided that she wouldn&rsquo;t be
            vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her
            answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to make her
            hurt his poor little feelings. A call at Meg&lsquo;s, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and
            Demijohn, still further fortified her for the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,<u><sup>ir</sup></u> but when
            she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn about and run away.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the jew&lsquo;s-harp, Jo?&rdquo; cried Laurie, as soon as he was within speaking
            distance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I forgot it.&rdquo; And Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not be called loverlike.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She always used to take his arm on these occasions; now she did not, and he made no complaint, which was a
            bad sign, but talked on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from the road into the
            little path that led homeward through the grove. Then he walked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of
            language, and now and then a dreadful pause occurred. To rescue the conversation from one of the wells of
            silence into which it kept falling, Jo said hastily, &ldquo;Now you must have a good long holiday!&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I intend to.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression
            that assured her the dreaded moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring, &ldquo;No,
            Teddy, please don&lsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I will, and you must hear me. It&rsquo;s no use, Jo, we&rsquo;ve got to have it out, and the sooner
            the better for both of us,&rdquo; he answered, getting flushed and excited all at once.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Say what you like, then. I&rsquo;ll listen,&rdquo; said Jo, with a desperate sort of patience.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to &ldquo;have it out,&rdquo; if he died in the
            attempt, so he plunged into the subject with characteristic impetuosity, saying in a voice that would get
            choky now and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve loved you ever since I&rsquo;ve known you, Jo, couldn&rsquo;t help it, you&rsquo;ve been so
            good to me. I&rsquo;ve tried to show it, but you wouldn&rsquo;t let me; now I&rsquo;m going to make you
            hear, and give me an answer, for I can&rsquo;t go on so any longer.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wanted to save you this. I thought you&rsquo;d understand&mdash;&rdquo; began Jo, finding it a great
            deal harder than she expected.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know you did, but girls are so queer you never know what they mean. They say no when they mean yes,
            and drive a man out of his wits just for the fun of it,&rdquo; returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind
            an undeniable fact.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away to keep you from it if I
            could.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought so; it was like you, but it was no use. I only loved you all the more, and I worked hard to
            please you, and I gave up billiards and everything you didn&rsquo;t like, and waited and never complained,
            for I hoped you&rsquo;d love me, though I&rsquo;m not half good enough&mdash;&rdquo; Here there was a choke
            that couldn&rsquo;t be controlled, so he decapitated but tercups while he cleared his &ldquo;confounded
            throat.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You, you are, you&rsquo;re a great deal too good for me, and I&rsquo;m so grateful to you, and so
            proud and fond of you, I don&rsquo;t see why I can&rsquo;t love you as you want me to. I&rsquo;ve tried, but
            I can&rsquo;t change the feeling, and it would be a lie to say I do when I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Really, truly, Jo?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Really, truly, dear.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were in the grove now, close by the stile; and when the last words fell reluctantly from Jo&rsquo;s
            lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on, but for once in his life that fence was too much
            for him; so he just laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still that Jo was frightened.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Teddy, I&rsquo;m sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it would do any good! I wish
            you wouldn&rsquo;t take it so hard. I can&rsquo;t help it. You know it&rsquo;s impossible for people to make
            themselves love other people if they don&lsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she
            softly patted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They do sometimes,&rdquo; said a muffled voice from the post.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s the right sort of love, and I&rsquo;d rather not try it&rdquo; was
            the decided answer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by the river, and the tall grass
            rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the
            stile,<u><sup>is</sup></u> &ldquo;Laurie, I want to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out in a fierce tone, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell
            me that, Jo, I can&rsquo;t bear it now!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tell what?&rdquo; she asked, wondering at his violence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That you love that old man.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What old man?&rdquo; demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you love him, I know I shall do
            something desperate.&rdquo; And he looked as if he would</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>keep his word, as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for she, too, was getting excited with all this,
            &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t swear, Teddy! He isn&rsquo;t old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best
            friend I&rsquo;ve got, next to you. Pray, don&rsquo;t fly into a passion. I want to be kind, but I know I
            shall get angry if you abuse my Professor. I haven&rsquo;t the least idea of loving him or anybody
            else.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this trouble.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t love anyone else, and I&rsquo;ll never forget you, Jo, never! never!&rdquo; with a stamp
            to emphasize his passionate words.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What shall I do with him?&rdquo; sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more unmanageable than she
            expected. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard what I wanted to tell you. Sit down and listen, for indeed I want
            to do right and make you happy,&rdquo; she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which proved
            that she knew nothing about love.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet, leaned his arm
            on the lower step of the stile, and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was not
            conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo&rsquo;s part, for how could she say hard things to her boy
            while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or two
            her hardness of heart had wrung from him? She gently turned his head away, saying, as she stroked the wavy
            hair which had been allowed to grow for her sake&mdash;how touching that was, to be sure! &mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I agree with Mother that you and I are not suited to each other, because our quick tempers and strong
            wills would probably make us very miserable, if we were so foolish as to&mdash;&rdquo; Jo paused a little
            over the last word, but Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Marry&mdash;no, we shouldn&lsquo;t! If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect saint, for you could
            make me anything you like.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve tried it and failed, and I won&rsquo;t risk our happiness by such a
            serious experiment. We don&rsquo;t agree and we never shall, so we&rsquo;ll be good friends all our lives,
            but we won&rsquo;t go and do anything rash.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, we will if we get the chance,&rdquo; muttered Laurie rebelliously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,&rdquo; implored Jo, almost at her
            wit&rsquo;s end.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be reasonable, I don&rsquo;t want to take what you call &lsquo;a sensible view,&rsquo;
            it won&rsquo;t help me, and it only makes you harder. I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve got any
            heart.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a little quiver in Jo&rsquo;s voice, and, thinking it a good omen, Laurie turned round, bringing
            all his persuasive powers to bear as he said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously
            wheedlesome before, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disappoint us, dear! Everyone expects it. Grandpa has set his heart
            upon it, your people like it, and I can&rsquo;t get on without you. Say you will, and let&rsquo;s be happy.
            Do, do!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution
            she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy, and never could. It was very hard to do, but
            she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; truly, so I won&rsquo;t say it at all. You&rsquo;ll see that
            I&rsquo;m right, by-and-by, and thank me for it&mdash;&rdquo; she began solemnly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I do!&rdquo; And Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning with indignation at
            the bare idea.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, you will!&rdquo; persisted Jo. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get over this after a while, and find some
            lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a fine mistress for your fine house. I
            shouldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m homely and awkward and odd and old, and you&rsquo;d be ashamed of me, and we
            should quarrel&mdash;we can&rsquo;t help it even now, you see&mdash;and I shouldn&rsquo;t like elegant
            society and you would, and you&rsquo;d hate my scribbling, and I couldn&rsquo;t get on without it, and we
            should be unhappy, and wish we hadn&rsquo;t done it, and everything would be horrid!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Anything more?&rdquo; asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to this prophetic burst.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nothing more, except that I don&rsquo;t believe I shall ever marry. I&rsquo;m happy as I am, and love
            my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up for any mortal man.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know better!&rdquo; broke in Laurie. &ldquo;You think so now, but there&rsquo;ll come a time when
            you will care for somebody, and you&rsquo;ll love him tremendously, and live and die for him. I know you
            will, it&rsquo;s your way, and I shall have to stand by and see it.&rdquo; And the despairing lover cast his
            hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical, if his face had not been so tragic.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I will live and die for him, if he ever comes and makes me love him in spite of myself, and you
            must do the best you can!&rdquo; cried Jo, losing patience with poor Teddy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my best,
            but you won&rsquo;t be reasonable, and it&rsquo;s selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can&rsquo;t
            give. I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend, but I&rsquo;ll never marry you, and the
            sooner you believe it the better for both of us&mdash;so now!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That speech was like fire to gunpowder. Laurie looked at her a minute as if he did not quite know what to do
            with himself, then turned sharply away, saying in a desperate sort of tone, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry
            some day, Jo.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, where are you going?&rdquo; she cried, for his face frightened her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;To the devil!&rdquo; was the consoling answer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a minute Jo&rsquo;s heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank toward the river, but it takes
            much folly, sin or misery to send a young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort
            who are conquered by a single failure. He had no thought of a melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct
            led him to fling hat and coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time up the
            river than he had done in many a race. Jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched the poor
            fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That will do him good, and he&rsquo;ll come home in such a tender, penitent state of mind, that I
            shan&rsquo;t dare to see him,&rdquo; she said, adding, as she went slowly home, feeling as if she had
            murdered some innocent thing, and buried it under the leaves, &ldquo;Now I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence
            to be very kind to my poor boy. I wish he&rsquo;d love Beth, perhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I
            was mistaken about her. Oh dear! How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them. I think it&rsquo;s
            dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story
            bravely through, and then broke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old
            gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach. He found it difficult to understand how any
            girl could help loving Laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better than Jo that
            love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of harm&rsquo;s way, for
            Young Impetuosity&rsquo;s parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his grandfather met him as if he knew nothing, and kept
            up the delusion very successfully for an hour or two. But when they sat together in the twilight, the time
            they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the
            young one to listen to praises of the last year&rsquo;s success, which to him now seemed love&rsquo;s labor
            lost. He bore it as long as he could, then went to his piano and began to play. The windows were open, and
            Jo, walking in the garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her sister,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for he played the &ldquo;Sonata Path&eacute;tique,&rdquo;<u><sup>it</sup></u> and played it as he never did
            before.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very fine, I dare say, but it&rsquo;s sad enough to make one cry. Give us something
            gayer, lad,&rdquo; said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart was full of sympathy, which he longed to show but
            knew not how.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several minutes, and would have got through
            bravely, if in a momentary lull Mrs. March&rsquo;s voice had not been heard calling, &ldquo;Jo, dear, come
            in. I want you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he listened, he lost his place, the music ended
            with a broken chord, and the musician sat silent in the dark.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand this,&rdquo; muttered the old gentleman. Up he got, groped his way to the piano,
            laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, &ldquo;I know, my boy, I
            know.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo herself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s an end of it!&rdquo; And he shook off his grandfather&rsquo;s hands with an
            impatient motion, for though grateful for the sympathy, his man&rsquo;s pride could not bear a man&rsquo;s
            pity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not quite. I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of it,&rdquo; returned Mr. Laurence
            with unusual mildness. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t care to stay at home just now, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to run away from a girl. Jo can&rsquo;t prevent my seeing her, and I shall stay
            and do it as long as I like,&rdquo; interrupted Laurie in a defiant tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not if you are the gentleman I think you. I&rsquo;m disappointed, but the girl can&rsquo;t help it,
            and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time. Where will you go?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Anywhere. I don&rsquo;t care what becomes of me.&rdquo; And Laurie got up with a reckless laugh that
            grated on his grandfather&rsquo;s ear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Take it like a man, and don&rsquo;t do anything rash, for God&rsquo;s sake. Why not go abroad, as you
            planned, and forget it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got through college.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah, but I didn&rsquo;t mean to go alone!&rdquo; And Laurie walked fast through the room with an
            expression which it was well his grandfather did not see. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you to go alone.
            There&rsquo;s someone ready and glad to go with you, anywhere in the world.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who, sir?&rdquo;
            stopping to listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Myself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying huskily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a selfish
            brute, but&mdash;you know&mdash;Grandfather&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I&rsquo;ve been through it all before, once in my own young days,
            and then with your father. Now, my dear boy, just sit quietly down and hear my plan. It&rsquo;s all settled,
            and can be carried out at once,&rdquo; said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man, as if fearful that
            he would break away as his father had done before him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, sir, what is it?&rdquo; And Laurie sat down, without a sign of interest in face or voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There is business in London that needs looking after. I meant you should attend to it, but I can do it
            better myself, and things here will get on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners do almost
            everything, I&rsquo;m merely holding on till you take my place, and can be off at any time.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But you hate traveling, sir. I can&rsquo;t ask it of you at your age,&rdquo; began Laurie, who was
            grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to go alone, if he went at all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to prevent it, for the mood in which he
            found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices. So, stifling a
            natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him, he said stoutly, &ldquo;Bless
            your soul, I&rsquo;m not superannuated<u><sup>iu</sup></u> yet. I quite enjoy the idea; it will do me good,
            and my old bones won&rsquo;t suffer, for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not easy, or that he did not like the plan, and
            made the old man add hastily, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be a marplot<u><sup>iv</sup></u> or a burden. I
            go because I think you&rsquo;d feel happier than if I was left behind. I don&rsquo;t intend to gad about
            with you, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in my own way. I&rsquo;ve friends in
            London and Paris, and should like to visit them; meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where
            you will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your heart&rsquo;s content.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the world a howling wilderness, but at the
            sound of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken
            heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness. He
            sighed, and then said, in a spiritless tone, &ldquo;Just as you like, sir, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where I
            go or what I do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It does to me, remember that, my lad. I give you entire liberty, but I trust you to make an honest use
            of it. Promise me that, Laurie.&rdquo; &ldquo;Anything you like, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; thought the old gentleman. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care now, but there&rsquo;ll come a
            time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I&rsquo;m much mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was hot, and before the blighted being
            recovered spirit enough to rebel, they were off. During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore
            himself as young gentlemen usually do in such cases. He was moody, irritable, and pensive by turns; lost his
            appetite, neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano; avoided Jo, but
            consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and
            oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day. Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of his unrequited
            passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to attempt consolation or offer sympathy. On some
            accounts, this was a relief to his friends, but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable, and
            everyone rejoiced that the &ldquo;poor, dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble, and come home
            happy.&rdquo; Of course, he smiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad superiority of
            one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain inconvenient emotions which seemed
            inclined to assert themselves. This gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did
            for his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with a whisper full of motherly
            solicitude; then feeling that he was going very fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the
            afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life. Jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him
            if he looked round. He did look round, came back, put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him,
            and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal both eloquent and pathetic.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Jo, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Teddy, dear, I wish I could!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was all, except a little pause; then Laurie straightened himself up, said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,
            never mind,&rdquo; and went away without another word. Ah, but it wasn&rsquo;t all right, and Jo did mind,
            for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as if she had stabbed her
            dearest friend, and when he left her without a look behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would
            come again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>36</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth&rsquo;s Secret</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with the change in Beth. No one spoke of it or seemed
            aware of it, for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to eyes sharpened by
            absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo&rsquo;s heart as she saw her sister&rsquo;s face.
            It was no paler and but little thinner than in the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about
            it, as if the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an
            indescribably pathetic<u><sup>iw</sup></u> beauty. Jo saw and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and
            soon the first impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt that she
            was better, and presently in other cares Jo for a time forgot her fear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety returned and haunted her. She had
            confessed her sins and been forgiven, but when she showed her savings and proposed the mountain trip, Beth
            had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from home. Another little visit to the seashore
            would suit her better, and as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took Beth down to
            the quiet place, where she could live much in the open air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little
            color into her pale cheeks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant people there, the girls made few friends,
            preferring to live for one another. Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care
            for anyone else; so they were all in all to each other, and came and went, quite unconscious of the interest
            they excited in those about them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble one,
            always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long separation was not far away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it; for often between ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us
            there exists a reserve which it is very hard to overcome. Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart
            and Beth&lsquo;s, but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there seemed something sacred in the silence,
            and she waited for Beth to speak. She wondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not seem to see
            what she saw, and during the quiet weeks when the shadows grew so plain to her, she said nothing of it to
            those at home, believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better. She wondered still more if
            her sister really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long
            hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in Jo&rsquo;s lap, while the winds blew healthfully over
            her and the sea made music at her feet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One day Beth told her. Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still, and putting down her book, sat looking at
            her with wistful eyes, trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth&rsquo;s cheeks. But she could
            not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even
            the rosy little shells they had been gathering. It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was
            slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she
            possessed. For a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and, when they cleared, Beth was looking up at her
            so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say, &ldquo;Jo dear, I&rsquo;m glad you know it.
            I&rsquo;ve tried to tell you, but I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was no answer except her sister&rsquo;s cheek against her own, not even tears, for when most deeply
            moved, Jo did not cry. She was the weaker then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms
            about her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known it for a good while, dear, and, now I&rsquo;m used to it, it isn&rsquo;t hard to
            think of or to bear. Try to see it so, and don&rsquo;t be troubled about me, because it&rsquo;s best; indeed
            it is.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel it then, and keep it to
            yourself so long, did you?&rdquo; asked Jo, refusing to see or say that it was best, but glad to know that
            Laurie had no part in Beth&rsquo;s trouble.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn&rsquo;t like to own it. I tried to think it was a sick fancy,
            and would not let it trouble anyone. But when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans, it
            was hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable, Jo.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Beth, and you didn&rsquo;t tell me, didn&rsquo;t let me comfort and help you! How could you shut
            me out, and bear it all alone?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo&rsquo;s voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must
            have gone on while Beth learned to say good-by to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so
            cheerfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right. I wasn&rsquo;t sure, no one said anything, and I hoped
            I was mistaken. It would have been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy
            away, and you so happy with Laurie&mdash;at least, I thought so then.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And I thought that you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I couldn&lsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Jo,
            glad to say all the truth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain, and added softly, &ldquo;Then you
            didn&lsquo;t, deary? I was afraid it was so, and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all
            that while.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?&rdquo; asked Beth, as innocently as a child.
            &ldquo;I do love him dearly; he is so good to me, how can I help it? But he never could be anything to me
            but my brother. I hope he truly will be, sometime.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not through me,&rdquo; said Jo decidedly. &ldquo;Amy is left for him, and they would suit excellently,
            but I have no heart for such things, now. I don&rsquo;t care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You must
            get well.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I want to, oh, so much! I try, but every day I lose a little, and feel more sure that I shall never
            gain it back. It&rsquo;s like the tide, Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can&rsquo;t be
            stopped.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen is too young. Beth, I can&rsquo;t let
            you go. I&rsquo;ll work and pray and fight against it. I&rsquo;ll keep you in spite of everything; there
            must be ways, it can&rsquo;t be too late. God won&rsquo;t be so cruel as to take you from me,&rdquo; cried
            poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously submissive than Beth&rsquo;s.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety; it shows itself in acts rather than in words, and
            has more influence than homilies or protestations. Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave
            her courage and patience to give up life, and cheerfully wait for death. Like a confiding child, she asked
            no questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and mother of us all, feeling sure that they,
            and they only, could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come. She did not
            rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely
            to the dear human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He draws us
            closer to Himself. She could not say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to go,&rdquo; for life was very sweet to her;
            she could only sob out, &ldquo;I try to be willing,&rdquo; while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter
            wave of this great sorrow broke over them together.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell them this when we go home?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think they will see it without words,&rdquo; sighed Jo, for now it seemed to her that Beth changed
            every day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, I&rsquo;ve heard that the people who love best are often blindest to such things. If they
            don&rsquo;t see it, you will tell them for me. I don&rsquo;t want any secrets, and it&rsquo;s kinder to
            prepare them. Meg has John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by Father and Mother,
            won&rsquo;t you, Jo?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If I can. But, Beth, I don&rsquo;t give up yet. I&rsquo;m going to believe that it is a sick fancy,
            and not let you think it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Jo, trying to speak cheerfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to express myself,
            and shouldn&rsquo;t try to anyone but you, because I can&rsquo;t speak out except to my Jo. I only mean to
            say that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long. I&rsquo;m not like the rest of you;
            I never made any plans about what I&rsquo;d do when I grew up; I never thought of being married, as you all
            did. I couldn&rsquo;t seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about at home, of no
            use anywhere but there. I never wanted to go away, and the hard part now is the leaving you all. I&rsquo;m
            not afraid, but it seems as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of
            the tide. A white-winged gull flew by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast; Beth watched it
            till it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness. A little gray-coated sand bird came tripping over the
            beach, &ldquo;peeping&rdquo; softly to itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea; it came quite close to Beth,
            looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone, dressing its wet feathers, quite at home. Beth
            smiled and felt comforted, for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind her that a
            pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dear little bird! See, Jo, how tame it is. I like peeps better than the gulls: they are not so wild
            and handsome, but they seem happy, confiding little things. I used to call them my birds last summer, and
            Mother said they reminded her of me&mdash;busy, quaker-colored<u><sup>ix</sup></u> creatures, always near
            the shore, and always chirping that contented little song of theirs. You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild,
            fond of the storm and the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone. Meg is the turtledove, and Amy
            is like the lark she writes about, trying to get up among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest
            again. Dear little girl! She&rsquo;s so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender, and no matter how high
            she flies, she never will forget home. I hope I shall see her again, but she seems so far away.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her. I&rsquo;m
            going to have you well and rosy by that time,&rdquo; began Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the
            talking change was the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort now, and she thought aloud in a way quite
            unlike bashful Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo, dear, don&rsquo;t hope any more. It won&rsquo;t do any good, I&rsquo;m sure of that. We
            won&rsquo;t be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait. We&rsquo;ll have happy times, for I
            don&rsquo;t suffer much, and I think the tide will go out easily, if you help me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face, and with that silent kiss, she dedicated herself soul and body to
            Beth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was right: there was no need of any words when they got home, for Father and Mother saw plainly now what
            they had prayed to be saved from seeing. Tired with her short journey, Beth went at once to bed, saying how
            glad she was to be home, and when Jo went down, she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling
            Beth&rsquo;s secret. Her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece, and did not turn as she came in;
            but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and Jo went to comfort her without a word.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>New Impressions</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At three o&lsquo;clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice<u><sup>iy</sup></u> may be seen on
            the Promenade des Anglais&mdash;a charming place, for the wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and
            tropical shrubs, is bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined with hotels and
            villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills. Many nations are represented, many languages spoken,
            many costumes worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a carnival. Haughty English,
            lively French, sober Germans, handsome Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, all
            drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticizing the latest celebrity who has
            arrived&mdash;Ristori or Dickens, Victor Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands.<u><sup>17</sup></u>
            The equipages are as varied as the company and attract as much attention, especially the low basket
            barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with a pair of dashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous
            flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch behind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with his hands behind him, and a somewhat
            absent expression of countenance. He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the
            independent air of an American&mdash;a combination which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look
            approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in black velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves,
            and orange flowers in their buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy him his inches. There were
            plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the young man took little notice of them, except to glance now and
            then at some blonde girl or lady in blue. Presently he strolled out of the promenade and stood a moment at
            the crossing, as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the Jardin
            Publique,<u><sup>iz</sup></u> or to wander along the beach toward Castle Hill. The quick trot of
            ponies&rsquo; feet made him look up, as one of the little carriages, containing a single lady, came rapidly
            down the street. The lady was young, blonde, and dressed in blue. He stared a minute, then his whole face
            woke up, and, waving his hat like a boy, he hurried forward to meet her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Laurie, is it really you? I thought you&rsquo;d never come!&rdquo; cried Amy, dropping the reins
            and holding out both hands, to the great scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter&rsquo;s
            step, lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these &ldquo;mad English.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas with you, and here I am.&rdquo;
            &ldquo;How is your grandfather? When did you come? Where are you staying?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Very well&mdash;last night&mdash;at the Chauvain. I called at your hotel, but you were all out.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I have so much to say, I don&rsquo;t know where to begin! Get in and we can talk at our ease, I was
            going for a drive and longing for company. Flo&rsquo;s saving up for tonight.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What happens then, a ball?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A Christmas party at our hotel. There are many Americans there, and they give it in honor of the day.
            You&rsquo;ll go with us, of course? Aunt will be charmed.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you. Where now?&rdquo; asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his arms, a proceeding which
            suited Amy, who preferred to drive, for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies&rsquo; backs
            afforded her infinite satisfaction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle Hill; the view is so lovely, and
            I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever been there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Often, years ago, but I don&rsquo;t
            mind having a look at it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now tell me all about yourself. The last I heard of you, your grandfather wrote that he expected you
            from Berlin.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris, where he has settled for the winter. He has
            friends there and finds plenty to amuse him, so I go and come, and we get on capitally.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sociable arrangement,&rdquo; said Amy, missing something in Laurie&rsquo;s manner,
            though she couldn&rsquo;t tell what.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, so we each suit ourselves, and there is no
            trouble. I am often with him, and he enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone is glad to see
            me when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old hole, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he added, with a look of
            disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the Place Napoleon in the old city.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;The dirt is picturesque, so I don&rsquo;t mind. The river and the hills are delicious, and these
            glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my delight. Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass;
            it&rsquo;s going to the Church of St. John.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing
            lighted tapers, and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt a new sort
            of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and she could not find the merry-faced boy she left in the
            moody-looking man beside her. He was handsomer than ever and greatly improved, she thought, but now that the
            flush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired and spiritless&mdash;not sick, nor exactly
            unhappy, but older and graver than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him. She couldn&rsquo;t
            understand it and did not venture to ask questions, so she shook her head and touched up her ponies, as the
            procession wound away across the arches of the Paglioni bridge<u><sup>ja</sup></u> and vanished in the
            church.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Que pensez-vous?&rdquo; <u><sup>jb</sup></u> she said, airing her French, which had improved in
            quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is charming,&rdquo; replied Laurie,
            bowing, with his hand on his heart and an admiring look.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to
            give her at home, when he promenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was &ldquo;altogether
            jolly,&rdquo; with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the head. She didn&rsquo;t like the new tone, for
            though not blase, it sounded indifferent in spite of the look.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the way he&rsquo;s going to grow up, I wish he&rsquo;d stay a boy,&rdquo; she thought,
            with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At Avigdor&rsquo;s she found the precious home letters and, giving the reins to Laurie, read them luxuriously
            as they wound up the shady road between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Beth is very poorly, Mother says. I often think I ought to go home, but they all say
            &lsquo;stay.&rsquo; So I do, for I shall never have another chance like this,&rdquo; said Amy, looking sober
            over one page.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think you are right, there; you could do nothing at home, and it is a great comfort to them to know
            that you are well and happy, and enjoying so much,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>my dear.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as he said that; and the fear that sometimes
            weighed on Amy&rsquo;s heart was lightened, for the look, the act, the brotherly &ldquo;my dear,&rdquo;
            seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land. Presently she
            laughed and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her
            cap, and issuing from her mouth the words, &ldquo;Genius burns!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket &ldquo;to keep it from blowing away,&rdquo; and listened
            with interest to the lively letter Amy read him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the morning, you and letters in the
            afternoon, and a party at night,&rdquo; said Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a
            flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed. While Amy stood laughing on
            the bank above him as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at
            him, with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought. He found nothing to perplex
            or disappoint, much to admire and approve, for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and manner,
            she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and
            bearing which we call elegance. Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage
            and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was; but her old petulance now
            and then showed itself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness was unspoiled by
            foreign polish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks, but he saw enough to satisfy and
            interest him, and carried away a pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine,
            which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair,
            and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved her hand as if welcoming him to her
            favorite haunt, and said, pointing here and there, &ldquo;Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the
            fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa Franca, Schubert&rsquo;s Tower, just
            below, and, best of all, that speck far out to sea which they say is Corsica?&rdquo;<u><sup>18</sup></u></p>
        <p>&ldquo;I remember, it&rsquo;s not much changed,&rdquo; he answered, without enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!&rdquo; said Amy, feeling in good spirits and
            anxious to see him so also.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the island which a greater
            usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting in his sight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself
            all this while,&rdquo; said Amy, seating herself, ready for a good talk.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered all her questions freely, she could only learn
            that he had roved about the Continent and been to Greece. So after idling away an hour, they drove home
            again, and having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left them, promising to return in the evening.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that night. Time and absence had done its work on
            both the young people; she had seen her old friend in a new light, not as &ldquo;our boy,&rdquo; but as a
            handsome and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to find favor in his sight. Amy
            knew her good points, and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and
            pretty woman.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tarlatan and tulle<u><sup>jc</sup></u> were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them on such
            occasions, and following the sensible English fashion of simple dress for young girls, got up charming
            little toilettes with fresh flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were both
            inexpensive and effective. It must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman, and
            indulged in antique coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear heart, we all have our
            little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness,
            and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,&rdquo; said Amy to herself, as she put
            on Flo&rsquo;s old white silk ball dress, and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion,<u><sup>jd</sup></u>
            out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair she had the
            sense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her
            head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the fashion, but it&rsquo;s becoming, and I can&rsquo;t afford to make a fright of
            myself,&rdquo; she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or braid, as the latest style commanded.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters
            of azalea, and framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines. Remembering the painted boots, she
            surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and chass&eacute;d down the room, admiring her
            aristocratic feet all by herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the real lace on Aunt&rsquo;s
            mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress. If I only had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly
            happy,&rdquo; she said, surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as she glided away; she seldom
            ran&mdash;it did not suit her style, she thought, for, being tall, the stately and
            Junoesque<u><sup>je</sup></u> was more appropriate than the sportive or piquante. She walked up and down the
            long salon<u><sup>jf</sup></u> while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the chandelier,
            which had a good effect upon her hair, then she thought better of it, and went away to the other end of the
            room, as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one. It so happened that she
            could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at
            the distant window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress, the slender, white figure
            against the red curtains was as effective as a well-placed statue.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good evening, Diana!&rdquo;<u><sup>jg</sup></u> said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she liked
            to see in his eyes when they rested on her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good evening, Apollo!&rdquo; she answered, smiling back at him, for he, too, looked unusually
            debonair, and the thought of entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity
            the four plain Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here are your flowers. I arranged them myself, remembering that you didn&rsquo;t like what Hannah
            calls a &lsquo;sot-bookay,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Laurie, handing her a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she
            had long coveted as she daily passed it in Cardiglia&rsquo;s window.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How kind you are!&rdquo; she exclaimed gratefully. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known you were coming I&rsquo;d
            have had something ready for you today, though not as pretty as this, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you. It isn&rsquo;t what it should be, but you have improved it,&rdquo; he added, as she snapped
            the silver bracelet on her wrist.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought you liked that sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not from you, it doesn&rsquo;t sound natural, and I like your old bluntness better.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; he answered, with a look of relief, then buttoned her gloves for her and
            asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to do when they went</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>to parties together at home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The company assembled in the long salle &agrave; manger<u><sup>jh</sup></u> that evening was such as one sees
            nowhere but on the Continent. The hospitable Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and
            having no prejudice against titles, secured a few to add luster to their Christmas ball.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady, dressed like
            Hamlet&rsquo;s mother<u><sup>ji</sup></u> in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin. A Polish
            count, aged eighteen, devoted himself to the ladies, who pronounced him &ldquo;a fascinating dear,&rdquo;
            and a German Serene Something, having come for the supper alone, roamed vaguely about, seeking what he might
            devour. Baron Rothschild&rsquo;s private secretary, a large-nosed Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon
            the world, as if his master&rsquo;s name crowned him with a golden halo; a stout Frenchman, who knew the
            Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing, and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with
            her little family of eight. Of course, there were many light-footed, shrill-voiced American girls, handsome,
            lifeless-looking English ditto,<u><sup>jj</sup></u> and a few plain but piquante French
            demoiselles;<u><sup>jk</sup></u> likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen who disported
            themselves gaily, while mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced
            with their daughters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Any young girl can imagine Amy&rsquo;s state of mind when she &ldquo;took the stage&rdquo; that night,
            leaning on Laurie&rsquo;s arm. She knew she looked well, she loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on
            her native heath in a ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first
            discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood. She did
            pity the Davis girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim papa and three grimmer
            maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed, which was good of her, as it
            permitted them to see her dress, and burn with curiosity to know who her distinguished-looking friend might
            be. With the first burst of the band, Amy&rsquo;s color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap
            the floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to know it: therefore the shock she received
            can better be imagined than described, when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone, &ldquo;Do you care to
            dance?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;One usually does at a ball.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as fast as possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I meant the first dance. May I have the honor?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can give you one if I put off the Count. He dances divinely, but he will excuse me, as you are an
            old friend,&rdquo; said Amy, hoping that the name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not
            to be trifled with.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support was all the satisfaction she got, however.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A daughter of the gods,</p>
        <p>Divinely tall, and most divinely fair,&rdquo;<u><sup>19</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy was compelled to walk decorously
            through a cotillion, feeling all the while as if she could dance the tarantella<u><sup>jl</sup></u> with a
            relish. Laurie resigned her to the &ldquo;nice little boy,&rdquo; and went to do his duty to Flo, without
            securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished, for she
            immediately engaged herself till supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs of penitence. She
            showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the
            next, a glorious polka redowa; but his polite regrets didn&rsquo;t impose upon her, and when she gallopaded
            away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him for a long while, except a word now and then when
            she came to her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a moment&rsquo;s rest. Her anger had a
            good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant.
            Laurie&rsquo;s eyes followed her with pleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit
            and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be. He very naturally fell to studying her from
            this new point of view, and before the evening was half over, had decided that &ldquo;little Amy was going
            to make a very charming woman.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of everyone, and Christmas
            merriment made all faces shine, hearts happy, and heels light. The musicians fiddled, tooted, and banged as
            if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who could, and those who couldn&rsquo;t admired their neighbors with
            uncommon warmth. The air was dark with Davises, and many Joneses gamboled like a flock of young giraffes.
            The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with a dashing Frenchwoman who carpeted the floor
            with her pink satin train. The Serene Teuton found the supper table and was happy, eating steadily through
            the bill of fare, and dismayed the gar&ccedil;ons<u><sup>jm</sup></u> by the ravages he committed. But the
            Emperor&rsquo;s friend covered himself with glory, for he danced everything, whether he knew it or not, and
            introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him. The boyish abandon of that stout man was
            charming to behold, for though he &ldquo;carried weight,&rdquo; he danced like an India-rubber ball. He ran,
            he flew, he pranced, his face glowed, his bald head shone, his coattails waved wildly, his pumps actually
            twinkled in the air, and when the music stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his
            fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility, and Laurie found
            himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as
            indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished her, with assurances that he was
            &ldquo;desolated to leave so early,&rdquo; she was ready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne
            his punishment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted affections find a balm in friendly society, and
            young nerves will thrill, young blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the
            enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion. Laurie had a waked-up look as he rose to give her his seat;
            and when he hurried away to bring her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile, &ldquo;Ah, I
            thought that would do him good!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You look like Balzac&rsquo;s &lsquo;Femme peinte par
            elle-m&ecirc;me,&rsquo;&rdquo;<u><sup>jn</sup></u> he said, as he fanned her with one hand and held her
            coffee cup in the other.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My rouge won&rsquo;t come off.&rdquo; And Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and showed him her white
            glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What do you call this stuff?&rdquo; he asked, touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his
            knee.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Illusion.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good name for it. It&rsquo;s very pretty&mdash;new thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as old as the hills; you have seen it on dozens of girls, and you never found out that it
            was pretty till now&mdash;stupide!&rdquo; &ldquo;I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the
            mistake, you see.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;None of that, it is forbidden. I&rsquo;d rather take coffee than compliments just now. No, don&rsquo;t
            lounge, it makes me nervous.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie sat bolt upright, and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having
            &ldquo;little Amy&rdquo; order him about, for she had lost her shyness now, and felt an irresistible desire
            to trample on him, as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of
            subjection.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Where did you learn all this sort of thing?&rdquo; he asked with a quizzical look.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;As &lsquo;this sort of thing&rsquo; is rather a vague expression, would you kindly explain?&rdquo;
            returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he meant, but wickedly leaving him to describe what is
            indescribable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;the general air, the style, the self-possession, the&mdash;the&mdash;illusion&mdash;you
            know,&rdquo; laughed Laurie, breaking down and helping himself out of his quandary with the new word.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy was gratified, but of course didn&rsquo;t show it, and demurely answered, &ldquo;Foreign life polishes
            one in spite of one&rsquo;s self, I study as well as play, and as for this&rdquo;&mdash;with a little
            gesture toward her dress&mdash;&ldquo;why, tulle is cheap, posies to be had for nothing, and I am used to
            making the most of my poor little things.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn&rsquo;t in good taste, but Laurie liked her the
            better for it, and found himself both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of
            opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers. Amy did not know why he looked at
            her so kindly, nor why he filled up her book with his own name, and devoted himself to her for the rest of
            the evening in the most delightful manner, but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result
            of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>38</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the Shelf</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married, when &ldquo;Vive la
            libert&eacute;&rdquo; <u><sup>jo</sup></u> becomes their motto. In America, as everyone knows, girls early
            sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons
            usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion almost as close as a French
            nunnery, though by no means as quiet. Whether they like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as
            soon as the wedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim, as did a very pretty woman the other
            day, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as handsome as ever, but no one takes any notice of me because I&rsquo;m
            married.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a
            year old, for in her little world primitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired and
            beloved than ever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very strong, and she was entirely absorbed in
            her children, to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else. Day and night she brooded over them
            with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the tender mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now
            presided over the kitchen department. Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the wifely attentions he
            had been accustomed to receive, but as he adored his babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a
            time, supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored. But three months passed, and
            there was no return of repose; Meg looked worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time,
            the house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life &ldquo;aisy,&rdquo; kept him on short commons.
            When he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma, if he came
            gaily in at night, eager to embrace his family, he was quenched by a &ldquo;Hush! They are just asleep after
            worrying all day.&rdquo; If he proposed a little amusement at home, &ldquo;No, it would disturb the
            babies.&rdquo; If he hinted at a lecture or concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a decided
            &ldquo;Leave my children for pleasure, never!&rdquo; His sleep was broken by infant wails and visions of a
            phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night; his meals were interrupted by the
            frequent flight of the presiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped, if a muffled chirp sounded from the
            nest above; and when he read his paper of an evening, Demi&rsquo;s colic got into the shipping list and
            Daisy&rsquo;s fall affected the price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of his wife, home was merely a nursery
            and the perpetual &ldquo;hushing&rdquo; made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred
            precincts of Babyland. He bore it very patiently for six months, and, when no signs of amendment appeared,
            he did what other paternal exiles do&mdash;tried to get a little comfort elsewhere. Scott had married and
            gone to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an
            evening, when his own parlor was empty, and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end. Mrs.
            Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable, and she performed her mission most
            successfully. The parlor was always bright and attractive, the chessboard ready, the piano in tune, plenty
            of gay gossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely, but as it was he gratefully took the
            next best thing and enjoyed his neighbor&rsquo;s society.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a relief to know that John was having a
            good time instead of dozing in the parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children. But
            by-and-by, when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours, leaving Mamma time
            to rest, she began to miss John, and find her workbasket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite in
            his old dressing gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender. She would not ask him to stay at
            home, but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told, entirely forgetting
            the many evenings he had waited for her in vain. She was nervous and worn out with watching and worry, and
            in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares
            oppress them. Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness, and too much devotion to that idol of American
            women, the teapot, makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she would say, looking in the glass, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting old and ugly. John
            doesn&rsquo;t find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty
            neighbor, who has no incum brances. Well, the babies love me, they don&rsquo;t care if I am thin and pale
            and haven&rsquo;t time to crimp my hair, they are my comfort, and some day John will see what I&rsquo;ve
            gladly sacrificed for them, won&rsquo;t he, my precious?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a crow, and Meg would put by her
            lamentations for a maternal revel, which soothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as
            politics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss interesting points with Scott, quite
            unconscious that Meg missed him. Not a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one
            day, and insisted on knowing what the matter was, for Meg&rsquo;s drooping spirits had not escaped her
            observation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t tell anyone except you, Mother, but I really do need advice, for if John goes on so
            much longer I might as well be widowed,&rdquo; replied Mrs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy&rsquo;s bib with an injured air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Goes on how, my dear?&rdquo; asked her mother anxiously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s away all day, and at night when I want to see him, he is continually going over to the
            Scotts&rsquo;. It isnt fair that I should have the hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very
            selfish, even the best of them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So are women. Don&rsquo;t blame John till you see where you are wrong yourself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t be right for him to neglect me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you neglect him?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, Mother, I thought you&rsquo;d take my part!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So I do, as far as sympathizing goes, but I think the fault is yours, Meg.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Let me show you. Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you made it a point to give him your
            society of an evening, his only leisure time?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, but I can&rsquo;t do it now, with two babies
            to tend.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think you could, dear, and I think you ought. May I speak quite freely, and will you remember that
            it&rsquo;s Mother who blames as well as Mother who sympathizes?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Indeed I will! Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I often feel as if I needed teaching more
            than ever since these babies look to me for everything.&rdquo; Meg drew her low chair beside her
            mother&lsquo;s, and, with a little interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly
            together, feeling that</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You have only made the mistake that most young wives make&mdash;forgotten your duty to your husband in
            your love for your children. A very natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be remedied
            before you take to different ways; for children should draw you nearer than ever, not separate you, as if
            they were all yours, and John had nothing to do but support them. I&rsquo;ve seen it for some weeks, but
            have not spoken, feeling sure it would come right in time.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t. If I ask him to stay, he&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m jealous, and I
            wouldn&rsquo;t insult him by such an idea. He doesn&rsquo;t see that I want him, and I don&rsquo;t know how
            to tell him without words.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Make it so pleasant he won&rsquo;t want to go away. My dear, he&rsquo;s longing for his little home;
            but it isn&rsquo;t home without you, and you are always in the nursery.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t I to be
            there?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you are unfitted for everything.
            Besides, you owe something to John as well as to the babies; don&rsquo;t neglect husband for children,
            don&rsquo;t shut him out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it. His place is there as well as
            yours, and the children need him; let him feel that he has his part to do, and he will do it gladly and
            faithfully, and it will be better for you all.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You really think so, Mother?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know it, Meg, for I&rsquo;ve tried it, and I seldom give advice unless I&rsquo;ve proved its
            practicability. When you and Jo were little, I went on just as you are, feeling as if I didn&rsquo;t do my
            duty unless I devoted myself wholly to you. Poor Father took to his books, after I had refused all offers of
            help, and left me to try my experiment alone. I struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was too much for
            me. I nearly spoiled her by indulgence. You were poorly, and I worried about you till I fell sick myself.
            Then Father came to the rescue, quietly managed everything, and made himself so helpful that I saw my
            mistake, and never have been able to get on without him since. That is the secret of our home happiness: he
            does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let
            domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits. Each do our part alone in many things, but at home we
            work together, always.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It is so, Mother; and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours.
            Show me how, I&rsquo;ll do anything you say.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You always were my docile daughter. Well, dear, if I were you, I&rsquo;d let John have more to do with
            the management of Demi, for the boy needs training, and it&rsquo;s none too soon to begin. Then I&rsquo;d do
            what I have often proposed, let Hannah come and help you; she is a capital nurse, and you may trust the
            precious babies to her while you do more housework. You need the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and
            John would find his wife again. Go out more, keep cheerful as well as busy, for you are the sunshine-maker
            of the family, and if you get dismal there is no fair weather. Then I&rsquo;d try to take an interest in
            whatever John likes&mdash;talk with him, let him read to you, exchange ideas, and help each other in that
            way. Don&rsquo;t shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman, but understand what is going on, and
            educate yourself to take your part in the world&rsquo;s work, for it all affects you and yours.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;John is so sensible, I&rsquo;m afraid he will think I&rsquo;m stupid if I ask questions about politics
            and things.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he would. Love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom could you ask more freely
            than of him? Try it, and see if he doesn&rsquo;t find your society far more agreeable than Mrs.
            Scott&rsquo;s sup pers.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I will. Poor John! I&rsquo;m afraid I have neglected him sadly, but I thought I was right, and he
            never said anything.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He tried not to be selfish, but he has felt rather forlorn, I fancy. This is just the time, Meg, when
            young married people are apt to grow apart, and the very time when they ought to be most together; for the
            first tenderness soon wears off, unless care is taken to preserve it; and no time is so beautiful and
            precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given them to train. Don&rsquo;t let John be a
            stranger to the babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and
            temptation than anything else, and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should.
            Now, dear, good-by; think over Mother&rsquo;s preachment, act upon it if it seems good, and God bless you
            all!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the first attempt was not made exactly as she
            planned to have it. Of course the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as they found
            out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted. Mamma was an abject slave to their
            caprices, but Papa was not so easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt
            at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi inherited a trifle of his sire&rsquo;s firmness
            of character&mdash;we won&rsquo;t call it obstinacy&mdash;and when he made up his little mind to have or to
            do anything, all the king&rsquo;s horses and all the king&rsquo;s men could not change that pertinacious
            little mind. Mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices, but Papa believed that
            it never was too soon to learn obedience; so Master Demi early discovered that when he undertook to
            &ldquo;wrastle&rdquo; with &ldquo;parpar,&rdquo; he always got the worst of it; yet, like the Englishman,
            Baby respected the man who conquered him, and loved the father whose grave &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; was more
            impressive than all Mamma&rsquo;s love pats.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social evening with John; so she ordered a
            nice supper, set the parlor in order, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early, that
            nothing should interfere with her experiment. But unfortunately Demi&rsquo;s most unconquerable prejudice
            was against going to bed, and that night he decided to go on a rampage; so poor Meg sang and rocked, told
            stories and tried every sleep-provoking wile she could devise, but all in vain, the big eyes wouldn&rsquo;t
            shut; and long after Daisy had gone to byelow,<u><sup>jp</sup></u> like the chubby little bunch of good
            nature she was, naughty Demi lay staring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake expression of
            countenance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs down and gives poor Papa his tea?&rdquo; asked
            Meg, as the hall door softly closed, and the well-known step went tip-toeing into the dining room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Me has tea!&rdquo; said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you&rsquo;ll go bye-by like Daisy.
            Will you, lovey?&rdquo; &ldquo;Iss!&rdquo; and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and hurry the
            desired day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling
            face and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration. He saw it at once and said with
            pleased surprise, &ldquo;Why, little mother, how gay we are tonight. Do you expect company?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Only you, dear.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Is it a birthday, anniversary, or anything?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m tired of being a dowdy, so I dressed up as a change. You always make yourself nice for
            table, no matter how tired you are, so why shouldn&rsquo;t I when I have the time?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I do it out of respect to you, my dear,&rdquo; said old-fashioned John.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke,&rdquo; laughed Meg, looking young and pretty again, as she nodded to him
            over the teapot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s altogether delightful, and like old times. This tastes right. I drink your health,
            dear.&rdquo; And John sipped his tea with an air of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration
            however, for as he put down his cup, the door handle rattled mysteriously, and a little voice was heard,
            saying impatiently &mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Opy doy; me&rsquo;s tummin!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that naughty boy. I told him to go to sleep alone, and here he is, downstairs, getting his
            death a-cold pattering over that canvas,&rdquo; said Meg, answering the call.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; now,&rdquo; announced Demi in a joyful tone as he entered, with his long nightgown
            gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eying the
            &ldquo;cakies&rdquo; with loving glances.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t morning yet. You must go to bed, and not trouble poor Mamma. Then you can have the
            little cake with sugar on it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Me loves Parpar,&rdquo; said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal knee and revel in
            forbidden joys. But John shook his head, and said to Meg&mdash; &ldquo;If you told him to stay up there, and
            go to sleep alone, make him do it, or he will never learn to mind you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Come, Demi.&rdquo; And Meg led her son away, feeling a strong desire to spank the
            little marplot who hopped beside her, laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as
            soon as they reached the nursery.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually gave him a lump of sugar, tucked him into his
            bed, and forbade any more promenades till morning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Iss!&rdquo; said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and regarding his first attempt as
            eminently successful.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when the little ghost walked again and
            exposed the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding, &ldquo;More sudar, Marmar.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now this won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said John, hardening his heart against the engaging little sinner.
            &ldquo;We shall never know any peace till that child learns to go to bed properly. You have made a slave of
            yourself long enough. Give him one lesson, and then there will be an end of it. Put him in his bed and leave
            him, Meg.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t stay there, he never does unless I sit by him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage him. Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as Mamma bids you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;S&lsquo;ant!&rdquo; replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted &ldquo;cakie,&rdquo; and
            beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You must never say that to Papa. I shall carry you if you don&rsquo;t go yourself.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Go &lsquo;way, me don&rsquo;t love Parpar.&rdquo; And Demi retired to his mother&rsquo;s skirts for
            protection.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to the enemy, with a &ldquo;Be gentle with
            him, John,&rdquo; which struck the culprit with dismay, for when Mamma deserted him, then the judgment day
            was at hand. Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a strong hand to that detested
            bed, poor Demi could not restrain his wrath, but openly defied Papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the
            way upstairs. The minute he was put into bed on one side, he rolled out on the other, and made for the door,
            only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again, which lively
            performance was kept up till the young man&rsquo;s strength gave out, when he devoted himself to roaring at
            the top of his voice. This vocal exercise usually conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post which
            is popularly believed to be deaf. No coaxing, no sugar, no lullaby, no story, even the light was put out and
            only the red glow of the fire enlivened the &ldquo;big dark&rdquo; which Demi regarded with curiosity rather
            than fear. This new order of things disgusted him, and he howled dismally for &ldquo;Marmar,&rdquo; as his
            angry passions subsided, and recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat. The
            plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg&rsquo;s heart, and she ran up to say
            beseechingly&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Let me stay with him, he&rsquo;ll be good, now, John.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, my dear, I&rsquo;ve told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him; and he must, if I stay here all
            night.&rdquo; &ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll cry himself sick,&rdquo; pleaded Meg, reproaching herself for deserting
            her boy.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, he won&lsquo;t, he&rsquo;s so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter is settled, for he
            will understand that he has got to mind. Don&rsquo;t interfere, I&rsquo;ll manage him.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my child, and I can&rsquo;t have his spirit broken by harshness.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my child, and I won&rsquo;t have his temper spoiled by indulgence. Go down, my dear, and
            leave the boy to me.&rdquo; When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and never regretted
            her docility. &ldquo;Please let me kiss him once, John?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Certainly. Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go and rest, for she is very tired with taking
            care of you all day.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory, for after it was given, Demi sobbed more quietly,
            and lay quite still at the bottom of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Poor little man, he&rsquo;s worn out with sleep and crying. I&rsquo;ll cover him up, and then go and
            set Meg&rsquo;s heart at rest,&rdquo; thought John, creeping to the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious
            heir asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he wasn&lsquo;t, for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi&rsquo;s eyes opened, his little chin began
            to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying with a penitent hiccough, &ldquo;Me&rsquo;s dood, now.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence which followed the uproar, and after imagining
            all sorts of impossible accidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest. Demi lay fast asleep,
            not in his usual spread-eagle attitude, but in a subdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his
            father&rsquo;s arm and holding his father&rsquo;s finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered with
            mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and a wiser baby. So held, John had waited with womanly patience till
            the little hand relaxed its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that tussle with his
            son than with his whole day&rsquo;s work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to herself, and then slipped away again, saying
            in a satisfied tone, &ldquo;I never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies: he does know how
            to manage them, and will be a great help, for Demi is getting too much for me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful wife, he was agreeably surprised to
            find Meg placidly trimming a bonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read something about the
            election, if he was not too tired. John saw in a minute that a revolution of some kind was going on, but
            wisely asked no questions, knowing that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn&rsquo;t keep a
            secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would soon appear. He read a long debate with the most
            amiable readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner, while Meg tried to look deeply interested,
            to ask intelligent questions, and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the nation to the state
            of her bonnet. In her secret soul, however, she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics, and that
            the mission of politicians seemed to be calling each other names; but she kept these feminine ideas to
            herself, and when John paused, shook her head and said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity,
            &ldquo;Well, I really don&rsquo;t see what we are coming to.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on
            her hand, and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I&rsquo;ll try and like millinery for hers,
            that&rsquo;s only fair,&rdquo; thought John the Just, adding aloud, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very pretty. Is it
            what you call a breakfast cap?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My dear man, it&rsquo;s a bonnet! My very best go-to-concert-and-theater bonnet.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of the flyaway things you sometimes
            wear. How do you keep it on?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so.&rdquo; And Meg illustrated by
            putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks young and happy
            again.&rdquo; And John kissed the smiling face, to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new concerts some night. I really
            need some music to put me in tune. Will you, please?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like. You have been shut up so long, it will
            do you no end of good, and I shall enjoy it, of all things. What put it into your head, little
            mother?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts I
            felt, and she said I needed change and less care; so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I&rsquo;m
            to see things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just to keep me from getting to be a
            fidgety, broken-down old woman before my time. It&rsquo;s only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for
            your sake as much as for mine, because I&rsquo;ve neglected you shamefully lately, and I&rsquo;m going to
            make home what it used to be, if I can. You don&rsquo;t object, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin; all that we
            have any business to know is that John did not appear to object, judging from the changes which gradually
            took place in the house and its inmates. It was not all Paradise by any means, but everyone was better for
            the division of labor system: the children throve under the paternal rule, for accurate, steadfast John
            brought order and obedience into Babydom, while Meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty
            of wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential conversation with her sensible husband. Home
            grew homelike again, and John had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg with him. The Scotts came to the
            Brookes&rsquo; now, and everyone found the little house a cheerful place, full of happiness, content, and
            family love. Even gay Sallie Moffat liked to go there. &ldquo;It is always so quiet and pleasant here, it
            does me good, Meg,&rdquo; she used to say, looking about her with wistful eyes, as if trying to discover the
            charm, that she might use it in her great house, full of splendid loneliness; for there were no riotous,
            sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived in a world of his own, where there was no place for her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had found the key to it, and each year of
            married life taught them how to use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual helpfulness,
            which the poorest may possess, and the richest cannot buy. This is the sort of shelf on which young wives
            and mothers may consent to be laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world, finding loyal lovers
            in the little sons and daughters who cling to them, undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age; walking side by
            side, through fair and stormy weather, with a faithful friend, who is, in the true sense of the good old
            Saxon<u><sup>jq</sup></u> word, the &ldquo;house-band,&rdquo; and learning, as Meg learned, that a
            woman&rsquo;s happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen, but a wise
            wife and mother.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>39</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lazy Laurence</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month. He was tired of wandering about alone,
            and Amy&rsquo;s familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a
            part. He rather missed the &ldquo;petting&rdquo; he used to receive, and enjoyed a taste of it again; for no
            attentions, however flattering, from strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls
            at home. Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very glad to see him now, and quite clung to
            him, feeling that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would
            confess. They naturally took comfort in each other&rsquo;s society and were much together, riding, walking,
            dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice no one can be very industrious during the gay season. But, while
            apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were half-consciously making discoveries
            and forming opinions about each other. Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in hers,
            and each felt the truth before a word was spoken. Amy tried to please, and succeeded, for she was grateful
            for the many pleasures he gave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women know how
            to lend an indescribable charm. Laurie made no effort of any kind, but just let himself drift along as
            comfortably as possible, trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because one had
            been cold to him. It cost him no effort to be generous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice
            if she would have taken them, but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was
            forming of him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful,
            half-scornful surprise.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day; I preferred to stay at home and write letters. They are
            done now, and I am going to Valrosa<u><sup>jr</sup></u> to sketch, will you come?&rdquo; said Amy, as she
            joined Laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual about noon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, but isn&rsquo;t it rather warm for such a long walk?&rdquo; he answered slowly, for the
            shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so you&rsquo;ll have nothing to
            do but hold your umbrella, and keep your gloves nice,&rdquo; returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the
            immaculate kids, which were a weak point with Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go with pleasure.&rdquo; And he put out his hand for her sketchbook. But she tucked it
            under her arm with a sharp&mdash; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself. It&rsquo;s no exertion to me, but you
            don&rsquo;t look equal to it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs, but when they got into the
            carriage he took the reins himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep
            on his perch.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The two never quarreled&mdash;Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie was too lazy, so in a minute he
            peeped under her hatbrim with an inquiring air; she answered with a smile, and they went on together in the
            most amicable manner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes.
            Here an ancient monastery, whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them. There a bare-legged
            shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his
            goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet. Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with panniers of
            freshly cut grass, passed by, with a pretty girl in a capaline<u><sup>js</sup></u> sitting between the green
            piles, or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the
            quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on the bough. Gnarled olive trees covered
            the hills with their dusky foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones fringed the
            roadside; while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the Maritime Alps<u><sup>jt</sup></u> rose sharp and
            white against the blue Italian sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere. They
            overhung the archway, thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to
            passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the
            hill. Every shadowy nook, where seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool grotto
            had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers, and every fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale
            pink roses, leaning down to smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped the
            cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace, whence one looked down
            on the sunny Mediterranean, and the white-walled city on its shore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn&rsquo;t it? Did you ever see such roses?&rdquo; asked Amy,
            pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, nor felt such thorns,&rdquo; returned Laurie, with his thumb in his mouth, after a vain attempt to
            capture a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns,&rdquo; said Amy, gathering three of the tiny
            cream-colored ones that starred the wall behind her. She put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering, and
            he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in the Italian part of his nature
            there was a touch of superstition, and he was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy,
            when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere. He had thought of
            Jo in reaching after the thorny red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like
            that from the greenhouse at home. The pale roses Amy gave him were the sort that the Italians lay in dead
            hands, never in bridal wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself; but the
            next instant his American common sense got the better of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh
            than Amy had heard since he came.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good advice, you&rsquo;d better take it and save your fingers,&rdquo; she said, thinking
            her speech amused him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will,&rdquo; he answered in jest, and a few months later he did it in earnest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?&rdquo; she asked presently, as she settled herself on
            a rustic seat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Very soon.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I dare say, short answers save trouble.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He expects you, and you really ought to go.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hospitable creature! I know it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Natural depravity, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Natural indolence, you mean. It&rsquo;s really dreadful!&rdquo; And Amy looked severe.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I might as well stay and plague you
            a little longer, you can bear it better; in fact, I think it agrees with you excellently.&rdquo; And Laurie
            composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of resignation, but she had made up her mind to
            lecture &ldquo;that boy,&rdquo; and in a minute she began again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What are you doing just now?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Watching lizards.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, no. I mean what do you intend and wish to do?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Smoke a cigarette, if you&rsquo;ll allow me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How provoking you are! I don&rsquo;t approve of cigars and I will only allow it on condition that you
            let me put you into my sketch. I need a figure.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;With all the pleasure in life. How will you have me&mdash;full-length or three-quarters, on my head or
            my heels? I should respectfully suggest a recumbent posture, then put yourself in also, and call it
            &lsquo;Dolce far niente.&rsquo; &rdquo; <u><sup>ju</sup></u></p>
        <p>&ldquo;Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like. I intend to work hard,&rdquo; said Amy in her most
            energetic tone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What delightful enthusiasm!&rdquo; And he leaned against a tall urn with an air of entire
            satisfaction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What would Jo say if she saw you now?&rdquo; asked Amy impatiently, hoping to stir him up by the
            mention of her still more energetic sister&rsquo;s name.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;As usual, &lsquo;Go away, Teddy, I&rsquo;m busy!&rsquo;&rdquo; He laughed as he spoke, but the laugh
            was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound
            that was not healed yet. Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them before, and now
            she looked up in time to catch a new expression on Laurie&rsquo;s face&mdash;a hard, bitter look, full of
            pain, dissatisfaction, and regret. It was gone before she could study it and the listless expression back
            again. She watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he
            lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for he seemed to have
            forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb,&rdquo; she said, carefully tracing the
            well-cut profile defined against the dark stone. &ldquo;Wish I was!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You are so changed, I sometimes
            think&mdash;&rdquo; There Amy stopped, with a half-timid, half-wistful look, more significant than her
            unfinished speech.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated to express, and looking straight into
            her eyes, said, just as he used to say it to her mother, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, ma&lsquo;am.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately. It also touched her, and
            she showed that it did, by the cordial tone in which she said&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that! I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d been a very bad boy, but I fancied you might
            have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband,
            or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour.
            Don&rsquo;t stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the grass here and &lsquo;let us be friendly,&rsquo;
            as Jo used to say when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the
            ribbons of Amy&rsquo;s hat, that lay there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ready for the secrets.&rdquo; And he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in
            his eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve none to tell; you may begin.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you&rsquo;d had some news from home.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You have heard all that has come lately. Don&rsquo;t you hear often? I fancied Jo would send you
            volumes.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very busy. I&rsquo;m roving about so, it&rsquo;s impossible to be regular, you know. When
            do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella?&rdquo; he asked, changing the subject abruptly after another
            pause, in which he had been wondering if Amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she answered, with a despondent but decided air. &ldquo;Rome took all the vanity out of
            me, for after seeing the wonders there, I felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in
            despair.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why should you, with so much energy and talent?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just why&mdash;because talent isn&rsquo;t genius, and no amount of energy can make it so.
            I want to be great, or nothing. I won&rsquo;t be a common-place dauber, so I don&rsquo;t intend to try any
            more.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get the chance.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring; but audacity becomes young people, and Amy&rsquo;s
            ambition had a good foundation. Laurie smiled, but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose
            when a long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good! And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her downcast face that made Laurie sit up
            and say gravely, &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to play brother, and ask questions. May I?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t promise to answer.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your face will, if your tongue won&rsquo;t. You aren&rsquo;t woman of the world enough yet to hide
            your feelings, my dear. I heard rumors about Fred and you last year, and it&rsquo;s my private opinion that
            if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come of
            it&mdash;hey?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not for me to say,&rdquo; was Amy&rsquo;s prim reply, but her lips would smile, and there
            was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are not engaged, I hope?&rdquo; And Laurie looked very elder-brotherly and grave all of a sudden.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down upon his knees, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
            &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then you are fond of old Fred?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I could be, if I tried.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul, what unearthly prudence!
            He&rsquo;s a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I fancied you&rsquo;d like.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,&rdquo; began Amy, trying to be quite cool and
            dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of herself, in spite of the sincerity of her intentions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I understand. Queens of society can&rsquo;t get on without money, so you mean to make a good match,
            and start in that way? Quite right and proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of
            your mother&rsquo;s girls.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;True, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker.
            Laurie felt this instinctively and laid himself down again, with a sense of disappointment which he could
            not explain. His look and silence, as well as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her
            resolve to deliver her lecture without delay.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,&rdquo; she said sharply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do it for me, there&rsquo;s a dear girl.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I could, if I tried.&rdquo; And she looked as if she would like doing it in the most summary style.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Try, then. I give you leave,&rdquo; returned Laurie, who enjoyed having someone to tease, after his
            long abstinence from his favorite pastime. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be angry in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never angry with you. It takes two flints to make a fire: you are as cool and soft as
            snow.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what I can do; snow produces a glow and a tingle, if applied rightly. Your
            indifference is half affectation, and a good stirring up would prove it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Stir away, it won&rsquo;t hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said when his little wife beat
            him. Regard me in the light of a husband or a carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise
            agrees with you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the apathy that so altered him, Amy
            sharpened both tongue and pencil, and began:</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Flo and I have got a new name for you; it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lazy Laurence.&rsquo;<u><sup>jv</sup></u> How
            do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>She thought it would annoy him, but he only folded his arms under his head, with an imperturbable
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not bad. Thank you, ladies.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Pining to be told.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, I despise you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If she had even said &ldquo;I hate you&rdquo; in a petulant or coquettish tone, he would have laughed and
            rather liked it, but the grave, almost sad, accent of her voice made him open his eyes, and ask
            quickly&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why, if you please?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are faulty, lazy, and
            miserable.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Strong language, mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you like it, I&rsquo;ll go on.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Pray, do, it&rsquo;s quite interesting.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d find it so; selfish people always like to talk about themselves.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Am I selfish?&rdquo; The question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise, for the one
            virtue on which he prided himself was generosity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, very selfish,&rdquo; continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as effective just then as an
            angry one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you how, for I&rsquo;ve studied you while we have been frolicking, and
            I&rsquo;m not at all satisfied with you. Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing but
            waste time and money and disappoint your friends.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year grind?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look as if you&rsquo;d had much; at any rate, you are none the better for it, as far
            as I can see. I said when we first met that you had improved. Now I take it all back, for I don&rsquo;t
            think you half so nice as when I left you at home. You have grown abominably lazy, you like gossip, and
            waste time on frivolous things, you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people, instead of being
            loved and respected by wise ones. With money, talent, position, health, and beauty&mdash;ah, you like that
            Old Vanity! But it&rsquo;s the truth, so I can&rsquo;t help saying it&mdash;with all these splendid things
            to use and enjoy, you can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man you might and ought to
            be, you are only&mdash;&rdquo; There she stopped, with a look that had both pain and pity in it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Saint Laurence on a gridiron,&rdquo;<u><sup>jw</sup></u> added Laurie, blandly finishing the sentence.
            But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half-angry,
            half-injured expression replaced the former indifference.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I supposed you&rsquo;d take it so. You men tell us we are angels, and say we can make you what we
            will, but the instant we honestly try to do you good, you laugh at us and won&rsquo;t listen, which proves
            how much your flattery is worth.&rdquo; Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the exasperating martyr
            at her feet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw, and Laurie&rsquo;s voice said, with a
            droll imitation of a penitent child, &ldquo;I will be good, oh, I will be good!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Amy did not laugh for she was in earnest, and tapping on the outspread hand with her pencil, said
            soberly, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of a hand like that? It&rsquo;s as soft and white as a
            woman&lsquo;s, and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin&rsquo;s best gloves<u><sup>jx</sup></u>
            and pick flowers for ladies. You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so I&rsquo;m glad to see there are no
            diamonds or big seal rings<u><sup>jy</sup></u> on it, only the little old one Jo gave you so long ago. Dear
            soul, I wish she was here to help me!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even
            Amy. She glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind, but he was lying with his hat half over his
            face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth. She only saw his chest rise and fall, with a long
            breath that might have been a sigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as if to
            hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in a minute various hints and trifles assumed
            shape and significance in Amy&rsquo;s mind, and told her what her sister never had confided to her. She
            remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she recalled the shadow on his face just now, the
            change in his character, and the wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand.
            Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence. Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was
            at the bottom of the alteration, and now she was sure of it. Her keen eyes filled, and when she spoke again,
            it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you weren&rsquo;t the sweetest-tempered
            fellow in the world, you&rsquo;d be very angry with me. But we are all so fond and proud of you, I
            couldn&rsquo;t bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps,
            they would understand the change better than I do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I think they would,&rdquo; came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as touching as a broken one.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding, when I should have been more
            kind and patient than ever. I never did like that Miss Randal and now I hate her!&rdquo; said artful Amy,
            wishing to be sure of her facts this time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hang Miss Randal!&rdquo; And Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his
            sentiments toward that young lady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, I thought&mdash;&rdquo; And there she paused diplomatically.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, you didn&lsquo;t, you knew perfectly well I never cared for any one but Jo.&rdquo; Laurie said
            that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face away as he spoke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and you came away, I supposed I was
            mistaken. And Jo wouldn&rsquo;t be kind to you? Why, I was sure she loved you dearly.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She was kind, but not in the right way, and it&rsquo;s lucky for her she didn&rsquo;t love me, if
            I&rsquo;m the good-for-nothing fellow you think me. It&rsquo;s her fault, though, and you may tell her
            so.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled Amy, for she did not know what balm to
            apply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I was wrong, I didn&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m very sorry I was so cross, but I can&rsquo;t help wishing
            you&rsquo;d bear it better, Teddy, dear.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&lsquo;t, that&rsquo;s her name for me!&rdquo; And Laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to
            stop the words spoken in Jo&rsquo;s half-kind, half-reproachful tone. &ldquo;Wait till you&rsquo;ve tried it
            yourself,&rdquo; he added in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn&rsquo;t be loved,&rdquo; said Amy, with the
            decision of one who knew nothing about it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well, making no moan, asking no sympathy, and
            taking his trouble away to live it down alone. Amy&rsquo;s lecture put the matter in a new light, and for
            the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure, and shut himself up in moody
            indifference. He felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to sleep
            again. Presently he sat up and asked slowly, &ldquo;Do you think Jo would despise me as you do?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, if she saw you now. She hates lazy people. Why don&rsquo;t you do something splendid, and make
            her love you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I did my best, but it was no use.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Graduating well, you mean? That was no more than you ought to have done, for your grandfather&rsquo;s
            sake. It would have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and money, when everyone knew you
            could do well.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn&rsquo;t love me,&rdquo; began Laurie, leaning his head on
            his hand in a despondent attitude.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, you didn&lsquo;t, and you&rsquo;ll say so in the end, for it did you good, and proved that you
            could do something if you tried. If you&rsquo;d only set about another task of some sort, you&rsquo;d soon
            be your hearty, happy self again, and forget your trouble.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Try it and see. You needn&rsquo;t shrug your shoulders, and think, &lsquo;Much she knows about such
            things.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t pretend to be wise, but I am observing, and I see a great deal more than
            you&rsquo;d imagine. I&rsquo;m interested in other people&rsquo;s experiences and inconsistencies, and,
            though I can&rsquo;t explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit. Love Jo all your days, if you
            choose, but don&rsquo;t let it spoil you, for it&rsquo;s wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you
            can&rsquo;t have the one you want. There, I won&rsquo;t lecture any more, for I know you&rsquo;ll wake up
            and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Neither spoke for several minutes. Laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger, and Amy put the last
            touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee,
            merely saying, &ldquo;How do you like that?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it was capitally done&mdash;the long, lazy
            figure on the grass, with listless face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the
            little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer&rsquo;s head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How well you draw!&rdquo; he said, with a genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill, adding, with a
            half-laugh, &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; &ldquo;As you are: this is as you were.&rdquo; And Amy laid
            another sketch beside the one he held.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults, and it
            recalled the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young man&rsquo;s face as he looked. Only a
            rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse: hat and coat were off, and every line of the active figure, resolute
            face, and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning. The handsome brute, just subdued, stood
            arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked
            up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him. In the ruffled mane, the rider&rsquo;s breezy hair
            and erect attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful
            buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the &ldquo;Dolce far niente&rdquo; sketch. Laurie
            said nothing, but as his eye went from one to the other, Amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as
            if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him. That satisfied her, and without waiting for him
            to speak, she said, in her sprightly way&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all looked on? Meg and Beth were
            frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced, and I sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my
            portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Much obliged. You&rsquo;ve improved immensely since then, and I congratulate you. May I venture to
            suggest in &lsquo;a honeymoon paradise&rsquo; that five o&rsquo;clock is the dinner hour at your
            hotel?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch, as if to
            remind her that even moral lectures should have an end. He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent air,
            but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more efficacious than he would confess. Amy felt the
            shade of coldness in his manner, and said to herself&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve offended him. Well, if it does him good, I&rsquo;m glad, if it makes him hate me,
            I&rsquo;m sorry, but it&rsquo;s true, and I can&rsquo;t take back a word of it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste, up behind, thought that monsieur and
            mademoiselle were in charming spirits. But both felt ill at ease: the friendly frankness was disturbed, the
            sunshine had a shadow over it, and, despite their apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the
            heart of each.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Shall we see you this evening, mon fr&egrave;re?&rdquo;<u><sup>jz</sup></u> asked Amy, as they parted
            at her aunt&rsquo;s door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Unfortunately I have an engagement. Au revoir, mademoiselle.&rdquo;<u><sup>ka</sup></u> And Laurie
            bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which became him better than many men. Something in his
            face made Amy say quickly and warmly&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I&rsquo;d rather have a hearty English
            handshake than all the sentimental salutations in France.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good-by, dear.&rdquo; And with these words, uttered in the tone she liked, Laurie left her, after a
            handshake almost painful in its heartiness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh
            at the end:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MY DEAR MENTOR,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself, for &ldquo;Lazy Laurence&rdquo; has gone to
            his grandpa, like the best of boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful
            honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser. Tell him so, with my congratulations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yours gratefully,</p>
        <p>TELEMACHUS.<sup>*</sup></p>
        <p>*In Homer&rsquo;s Odyssey, Odysseus&rsquo;s son, Telemachus, searches for his missing father.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good boy! I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Amy, with an approving smile; the next minute
            her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding, with an involuntary sigh, &ldquo;Yes, I am glad,
            but how I shall miss him!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The Valley of the Shadow</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable, and tried to bear it cheerfully,
            helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of
            trouble. They put away their grief, and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was gathered everything that she most
            loved&mdash;flowers, pictures, her piano, the little worktable, and the beloved pussies. Father&rsquo;s best
            books found their way there, Mother&rsquo;s easy chair, Jo&rsquo;s desk, Amy&rsquo;s finest sketches, and
            every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage, to make sunshine for Aunty Beth. John quietly set
            apart a little sum, that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she
            loved and longed for; old Hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite,
            dropping tears as she worked; and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters, seeming to
            bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth, tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could
            change the sweet, unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to make it happier for
            those who should remain behind. The feeble fingers were never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make
            little things for the schoolchildren daily passing to and fro&mdash;to drop a pair of mittens from her
            window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook<u><sup>kb</sup></u> for some small mother of many dolls,
            penwipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pothooks,<u><sup>kc</sup></u> scrapbooks for
            picture-loving eyes, and all manner of pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers up the ladder of
            learning found their way strewn with flowers, as it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of
            fairy godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and needs.
            If Beth had wanted any reward, she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her window, with
            nods and smiles, and the droll little letters which came to her, full of blots and gratitude.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look round, and say &ldquo;How beautiful
            this is!&rdquo; as they all sat together in her sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor,
            mother and sisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from the wise old books which
            seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as applicable now as when written centuries ago; a little chapel,
            where a paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying to show them that hope can
            comfort love, and faith make resignation possible. Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls of those
            who listened, for the father&rsquo;s heart was in the minister&rsquo;s religion, and the frequent falter in
            the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke or read.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation for the sad hours to come; for,
            by-and-by, Beth said the needle was &ldquo;so heavy,&rdquo; and put it down forever; talking wearied her,
            faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the
            ills that vexed her feeble flesh. Ah me! Such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching hearts and
            imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them
            beseechingly, to hear the bitter cry, &ldquo;Help me, help me!&rdquo; and to feel that there was no help. A
            sad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with death, but both were mercifully
            brief, and then, the natural rebellion over, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever. With the wreck
            of her frail body, Beth&rsquo;s soul grew strong, and though she said little, those about her felt that she
            was ready, saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,
            trying to see the Shining Ones<u><sup>kd</sup></u> coming to receive her when she crossed the river.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said, &ldquo;I feel stronger when you are here.&rdquo; She slept
            on a couch in the room, waking often to renew the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who
            seldom asked for anything, and &ldquo;tried not to be a trouble.&rdquo; All day she haunted the room,
            jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her.
            Precious and helpful hours to Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it needed: lessons in
            patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them; charity for all, the lovely
            spirit that can forgive and truly forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy, and
            the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts undoubtingly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Often when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little book, heard her singing softly, to beguile
            the sleepless night, or saw her lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the
            transparent fingers; and Jo would lie watching her with thoughts too deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in
            her simple, unselfish way, was trying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the life
            to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music she loved so well.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest hymns, the most fervent prayers that any
            voice could utter; for, with eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest sorrow,
            she recognized the beauty of her sister&rsquo;s life&mdash;uneventful, unambitious, yet full of the genuine
            virtues which &ldquo;smell sweet, and blossom in the dust,&rdquo; the self-forgetfulness that makes the
            humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible to all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One night when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find something to make her forget the mortal
            weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite,
            Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo&rsquo;s hand. The name caught her
            eye and the blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Poor Jo! She&rsquo;s fast asleep, so I won&rsquo;t wake her to ask leave; she shows me all her things,
            and I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll mind if I look at this,&rdquo; thought Beth, with a glance at her
            sister, who lay on the rug, with the tongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>MY BETH</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sitting patient in the shadow</p>
        <p>Till the blessed light shall come,</p>
        <p>A serene and saintly presence</p>
        <p>Sanctifies our troubled home.</p>
        <p>Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows</p>
        <p>Break like ripples on the strand<u><sup>ke</sup></u></p>
        <p>Of the deep and solemn river</p>
        <p>Where her willing feet now stand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O my sister, passing from me,</p>
        <p>Out of human care and strife,</p>
        <p>Leave me, as a gift, those virtues</p>
        <p>Which have beautified your life.</p>
        <p>Dear, bequeath me that great patience</p>
        <p>Which has power to sustain</p>
        <p>A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit</p>
        <p>In its prison-house of pain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Give me, for I need it sorely,</p>
        <p>Of that courage, wise and sweet,</p>
        <p>Which has made the path of duty</p>
        <p>Green beneath your willing feet.</p>
        <p>Give me that unselfish nature,</p>
        <p>That with charity divine</p>
        <p>Can pardon wrong for love&rsquo;s dear sake&mdash;</p>
        <p>Meek heart, forgive me mine!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thus our parting daily loseth</p>
        <p>Something of its bitter pain,</p>
        <p>And while learning this hard lesson,</p>
        <p>My great loss becomes my gain.</p>
        <p>For the touch of grief will render</p>
        <p>My wild nature more serene,</p>
        <p>Give to life new aspirations,</p>
        <p>A new trust in the unseen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henceforth, safe across the river,</p>
        <p>I shall see forevermore</p>
        <p>A beloved, household spirit</p>
        <p>Waiting for me on the shore.</p>
        <p>Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,</p>
        <p>Guardian angels shall become,</p>
        <p>And the sister gone before me</p>
        <p>By their hands shall lead me home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they brought a look of inexpressible comfort to
            Beth&rsquo;s face, for her one regret had been that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure her
            that her life had not been useless, that her death would not bring the despair she feared. As she sat with
            the paper folded between her hands, the charred log fell asunder. Jo started up, revived the blaze, and
            crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not asleep, but so happy, dear. See, I found this and read it. I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t care. Have I
            been all that to you, Jo?&rdquo; she asked, with wistful, humble earnestness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Beth, so much, so much!&rdquo; And Jo&rsquo;s head went down upon the pillow beside her
            sister&rsquo;s.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t feel as if I&rsquo;d wasted my life. I&rsquo;m not so good as you make me, but I
            have tried to do right; and now, when it&rsquo;s too late to begin even to do better, it&rsquo;s such a
            comfort to know that someone loves me so much, and feels as if I&rsquo;d helped them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;More than any one in the world, Beth. I used to think I couldn&rsquo;t let you go, but I&rsquo;m
            learning to feel that I don&rsquo;t lose you, that you&rsquo;ll be more to me than ever, and death
            can&rsquo;t part us, though it seems to.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know it cannot, and I don&rsquo;t fear it any longer, for I&rsquo;m sure I shall be your Beth still,
            to love and help you more than ever. You must take my place, Jo, and be everything to Father and Mother when
            I&rsquo;m gone. They will turn to you, don&rsquo;t fail them; and if it&rsquo;s hard to work alone, remember
            that I don&rsquo;t forget you, and that you&rsquo;ll be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or
            seeing all the world; for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the end
            so easy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, Beth.&rdquo; And then and there Jo renounced her old ambition, pledged herself to a
            new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief
            in the immortality of love.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth greener, the flowers were up fair and
            early, and the birds came back in time to say good-by to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child, clung
            to the hands that had led her all her life, as Father and Mother guided her tenderly through the Valley of
            the Shadow, and gave her up to God.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words, see visions, or depart with beatified
            countenances, and those who have sped many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and
            simply as sleep. As Beth had hoped, the &ldquo;tide went out easily,&rdquo; and in the dark hour before the
            dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one
            loving look, one little sigh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made her ready for the long sleep that pain would
            never mar again, seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic patience
            that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a
            benignant angel, not a phantom full of dread.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out, Jo&rsquo;s place was empty, and the
            room was very still. But a bird sang blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops blossomed freshly
            at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction over the placid face upon the
            pillow&mdash;a face so full of painless peace that those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and
            thanked God that Beth was well at last.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>41</p>

        <p>Learning to Forget</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy&rsquo;s lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own it till long afterward; men seldom do,
            for when women are the advisers, the lords of creation don&rsquo;t take the advice till they have persuaded
            themselves that it is just what they intended to do; then they act upon it, and, if it succeeds, they give
            the weaker vessel half the credit of it; if it fails, they generously give her the whole. Laurie went back
            to his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the
            climate of Nice had improved him wonderfully, and he had better try it again. There was nothing the young
            gentleman would have liked better, but elephants could not have dragged him back after the scolding he had
            received; pride forbid, and whenever the longing grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating
            the words that had made the deepest impression, &ldquo;I despise you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go and do something
            splendid that will make her love you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought himself to confess that he had been
            selfish and lazy, but then when a man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries
            till he has lived it down. He felt that his blighted affections were quite dead now, and though he should
            never cease to be a faithful mourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously. Jo
            wouldn&rsquo;t love him, but he might make her respect and admire him by doing something which should prove
            that a girl&rsquo;s no had not spoiled his life. He had always meant to do something, and Amy&rsquo;s advice
            was quite unnecessary. He had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently
            interred; that being done, he felt that he was ready to &ldquo;hide his stricken heart, and still toil
            on.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in
            music, and compose a Requiem which should harrow up Jo&rsquo;s soul and melt the heart of every hearer.
            Therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody and ordered him off, he went
            to Vienna, where he had musical friends, and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish
            himself. But, whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music, or music too ethereal to uplift a
            mortal woe, he soon discovered that the Requiem was beyond him just at present. It was evident that his mind
            was not in working order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying, for often in the middle of a plaintive
            strain, he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at Nice,
            especially the stout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning, but here again unforeseen
            difficulties beset him. He wanted Jo for his heroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender
            recollections and romantic visions of his love. But memory turned traitor; and, as if possessed by the
            perverse spirit of the girl, would only recall Jo&rsquo;s oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her
            in the most unsentimental aspects&mdash;beating mats with her head tied up in a bandanna, barricading
            herself with the sofa pillow, or throwing cold water over his passion &agrave; la Gummidge&mdash;and an
            irresistible laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint. Jo wouldn&rsquo;t be put into
            the opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a &ldquo;Bless that girl, what a torment she
            is!&rdquo; and a clutch at his hair, as became a distracted composer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to immortalize in melody, memory produced
            one with the most obliging readiness. This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden hair, was
            enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before his mind&rsquo;s eye in a pleasing chaos of
            roses, peacocks, white ponies, and blue ribbons. He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but he took
            her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her, as well he might, for he gifted her with every gift and
            grace under the sun, and escorted her, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated any mortal
            woman.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but gradually the work lost its charm, and he
            forgot to compose, while he sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get new ideas and
            refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state that winter. He did not do much, but he
            thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself.
            &ldquo;It&rsquo;s genius simmering, perhaps. I&rsquo;ll let it simmer, and see what comes of it,&rdquo; he
            said, with a secret suspicion all the while that it wasn&rsquo;t genius, but something far more common.
            Whatever it was, it simmered to some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory
            life, began to long for some real and earnest work to go at, soul and body, and finally came to the wise
            conclusion that everyone who loved music was not a composer. Returning from one of Mozart&rsquo;s grand
            operas, splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own, played a few of the best parts,
            sat staring up at the busts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back again; then
            suddenly he tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as the last fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly
            to himself&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She is right! Talent isn&rsquo;t genius, and you can&rsquo;t make it so. That music has taken the
            vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I won&rsquo;t be a humbug<u><sup>kf</sup></u> any longer.
            Now what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread. Now, if
            ever, occurred an eligible opportunity for &ldquo;going to the devil,&rdquo; as he once forcibly expressed
            it, for he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially fond of providing employment for
            full and idle hands. The poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood
            them pretty well; for much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith and confidence more, so his promise to
            his grandfather, and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him, and
            say &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; kept him safe and steady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it, boys will be boys, young men must
            sow their wild oats, and women must not expect miracles.&rdquo; I dare say you don&lsquo;t, Mrs. Grundy, but
            it&rsquo;s true nevertheless. Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion that they may perform
            even that of raising the standard of manhood by refusing to echo such sayings. Let the boys be boys, the
            longer the better, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must; but mothers, sisters, and friends
            may help to make the crop a small one, and keep many tares<u><sup>kg</sup></u> from spoiling the harvest, by
            believing, and showing that they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men
            manliest in good women&rsquo;s eyes. If it is a feminine delusion, leave us to enjoy it while we may, for
            without it half the beauty and the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would embitter all our
            hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads, who still love their mothers better than themselves and are
            not ashamed to own it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb all his powers for years, but to his
            great surprise he discovered it grew easier every day. He refused to believe it at first, got angry with
            himself, and couldn&rsquo;t understand it, but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things, and
            time and nature work their will in spite of us. Laurie&rsquo;s heart wouldn&rsquo;t ache; the wound
            persisted in healing with a rapidity that astonished him, and instead of trying to forget, he found himself
            trying to remember. He had not foreseen this turn of affairs, and was not prepared for it. He was disgusted
            with himself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that
            he could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon. He carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love,
            but they refused to burst into a blaze: there was only a comfortable glow that warmed and did him good</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>without putting him into a fever, and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was
            slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very tender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was
            sure to pass away in time, leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the word &ldquo;brotherly&rdquo; passed through his mind in one of these reveries, he smiled, and glanced
            up at the picture of Mozart that was before him:</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, he was a great man, and when he couldn&rsquo;t have one sister he took the other, and was
            happy.&rdquo;<u><sup>kh</sup></u></p>
        <p>Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them, and the next instant kissed the little old ring, saying
            to himself, &ldquo;No, I won&lsquo;t! I haven&rsquo;t forgotten, I never can. I&rsquo;ll try again, and if
            that fails, why, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to Jo, telling her that he could not
            settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn&rsquo;t she,
            wouldn&rsquo;t she, and let him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he did nothing, but he
            did it energetically, for he was in a fever of impatience. It came at last, and settled his mind effectually
            on one point, for Jo decidedly couldn&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t. She was wrapped up in Beth, and never
            wished to hear the word &ldquo;love&rdquo; again. Then she begged him to be happy with somebody else, but
            always to keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister Jo. In a postscript she desired him not to
            tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the
            remainder of her stay. That would be time enough, please God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not
            let her feel lonely, homesick, or anxious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So I will, at once. Poor little girl, it will be a sad going home for her, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
            And Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left
            unfinished some weeks before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged out his best paper, he came across something
            which changed his purpose. Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and business
            documents of various kinds were several of Jo&rsquo;s letters, and in another compartment were three notes
            from Amy, carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put
            away inside. With a half-repentant, half-amused expression, Laurie gathered up all Jo&rsquo;s letters,
            smoothed, folded, and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring
            thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the letters, locked the drawer, and went
            out to hear High Mass<u><sup>ki</sup></u> at Saint Stefan&lsquo;s, feeling as if there had been a funeral,
            and though not overwhelmed with affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than
            in writing letters to charming young ladies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy was homesick, and confessed it in the
            most delightfully confiding manner. The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to and fro with
            unfailing regularity, all through the early spring. Laurie sold his busts, made
            allumettes<u><sup>kj</sup></u> of his opera, and went back to Paris, hoping somebody would arrive before
            long. He wanted desperately to go to Nice, but would not till he was asked, and Amy would not ask him, for
            just then she was having little experiences of her own, which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical
            eyes of &ldquo;our boy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once decided to answer, &ldquo;Yes, thank
            you,&rdquo; but now she said, &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; kindly but steadily, for, when the time came, her
            courage failed her, and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new
            longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears. The words, &ldquo;Fred is a good fellow,
            but not at all the man I fancied you would ever like,&rdquo; and Laurie&rsquo;s face when he uttered them,
            kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in look, if not in words, &ldquo;I
            shall marry for money.&rdquo; It troubled her to remember that now, she wished she could take it back, it
            sounded so unwomanly. She didn&rsquo;t want Laurie to think her a heartless, worldly creature; she
            didn&rsquo;t care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a lovable woman; she was so
            glad he didn&rsquo;t hate her for the dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully and was kinder
            than ever. His letters were such a comfort, for the home letters were very irregular, and were not half so
            satisfactory as his when they did come. It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them, for the poor
            fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted in being stonyhearted. She ought to have made an
            effort, and tried to love him; it couldn&rsquo;t be very hard, many people would be proud and glad to have
            such a dear boy care for them: but Jo never would act like other girls, so there was nothing to do but be
            very kind, and treat him like a brother.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they would be a much happier race of
            beings than they are. Amy never lectured now: she asked his opinion on all subjects, she was interested in
            everything he did, made charming little presents for him, and sent him two letters a week, full of lively
            gossip, sisterly confidences, and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her. As few brothers are
            complimented by having their letters carried about in their sisters&rsquo; pockets, read and reread
            diligently, cried over when short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that Amy did
            any of these fond and foolish things. But she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost
            much of her relish for society, and went out sketching alone a good deal. She never had much to show when
            she came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while she sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the
            terrace at Valrosa, or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her&mdash;a stalwart knight carved on a
            tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over his eyes, or a curly-haired girl in gorgeous array,
            promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur according to the
            last fashion in art, which was safe but not altogether satisfactory.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred, and finding denials useless and explanations
            impossible, Amy left her to think what she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to
            Egypt. That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he said to himself, with a venerable
            air&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I was sure she would think better of it. Poor old fellow! I&rsquo;ve been through it all, and I can
            sympathize.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his duty to the past, put his feet up on
            the sofa and enjoyed Amy&rsquo;s letter luxuriously.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home; but the letter telling that Beth was
            failing never reached Amy, and when the next found her, the grass was green above her sister. The sad news
            met her at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from Nice in May, and they had traveled slowly to
            Switzerland, by way of Genoa<u><sup>kk</sup></u> and the Italian lakes. She bore it very well, and quietly
            submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit, for, since it was too late to say
            good-by to Beth, she had better stay, and let absence soften her sorrow. But her heart was very heavy, she
            longed to be at home, and every day looked wistfully across the lake, waiting for Laurie to come and comfort
            her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He did come very soon; for the same mail brought letters to them both, but he was in Germany, and it took
            some days to reach him. The moment he read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians,
            and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy and sorrow, hope and suspense.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little quay, he hurried along the shore to La Tour,
            where the Carrols were living en pension.<u><sup>kl</sup></u> The gar&ccedil;on was in despair that the
            whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake; but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be in the
            ch&acirc;teau garden. If monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting down, a flash of time should
            present her. But monsieur could not wait even &ldquo;a flash of time,&rdquo; and in the middle of the speech
            departed to find mademoiselle himself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts rustling overhead, ivy climbing
            everywhere, and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water. At one corner of the wide,
            low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or console herself with the beauty all about
            her. She was sitting here that day, leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy eyes,
            thinking of Beth and wondering</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>why Laurie did not come. She did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause in the archway
            that led from the subterranean path into the garden. He stood a minute, looking at her with new eyes, seeing
            what no one had ever seen before&mdash;the tender side of Amy&rsquo;s character. Everything about her mutely
            suggested love and sorrow&mdash;the blotted letters in her lap, the black ribbon that tied up her hair, the
            womanly pain and patience in her face; even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie,
            for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. If he had any doubts about the reception
            she would give him, they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for dropping everything, she
            ran to him, exclaiming, in a tone of unmistakable love and longing&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you&rsquo;d come to me!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood together quite silent for a moment, with the
            dark head bent down pro tectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so
            well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only woman in the world who could fill Jo&rsquo;s place
            and make him happy. He did not tell her so; but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth, were
            satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she dried her tears, Laurie gathered up the scattered
            papers, finding in the sight of sundry well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future.
            As he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive
            greeting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to see you. It was such a
            surprise to look up and find you, just as I was beginning to fear you wouldn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; she said,
            trying in vain to speak quite naturally.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I came the minute I heard. I wish I could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little
            Beth, but I can only feel, and&mdash;&rdquo; He could not get any further, for he, too, turned bashful all
            of a sudden, and did not quite know what to say. He longed to lay Amy&rsquo;s head down on his shoulder, and
            tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare, so took her hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic
            squeeze that was better than words.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t say anything, this comforts me,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Beth is well and
            happy, and I mustn&rsquo;t wish her back, but I dread the going home, much as I long to see them all. We
            won&rsquo;t talk about it now, tor it makes me cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay. You
            needn&rsquo;t go right back, need you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not if you want me, dear.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I do, so much. Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you seem like one of the family, and it would be so
            comfortable to have you for a little while.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at
            once, and gave her just what she wanted &mdash;the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she
            needed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Poor little soul, you look as if you&rsquo;d grieved yourself half sick! I&rsquo;m going to take care
            of you, so don&rsquo;t cry any more, but come and walk about with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit
            still,&rdquo; he said, in the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied on her hat,
            drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts. He
            felt more at ease upon his legs, and Amy found it very pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon, a
            familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed expressly made for them, so sunny and
            secluded was it, with nothing but the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry-away the echo of
            their words, as it rippled by below. For an hour this new pair walked and talked, or rested on the wall,
            enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell
            warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and sorrow behind her in the
            ch&acirc;teau garden.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl&rsquo;s altered face, she was illuminated with a new idea, and exclaimed
            to herself, &ldquo;Now I understand it all&mdash;the child has been pining for young Laurence. Bless my
            heart, I never thought of such a thing!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed no sign of enlightenment, but
            cordially urged Laurie to stay and begged Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so
            much solitude. Amy was a model of docility, and as her aunt was a good deal occupied with Flo, she was left
            to entertain her friend, and did it with more than her usual success.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded; at Vevay, Laurie was never idle, but always walking, riding,
            boating, or studying in the most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did and followed his
            example as far and as fast as she could. He said the change was owing to the climate, and she did not
            contradict him, being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as
            bodies. They seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills; the fresh
            winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and moody mists; the warm spring sunshine brought out
            all sorts of aspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts; the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of
            the past, and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them, saying, &ldquo;Little children, love
            one another.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a
            word. It took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the rapid cure of his first, and, as he had
            firmly believed, his last and only love. He consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that
            Jo&rsquo;s sister was almost the same as Jo&rsquo;s self, and the conviction that it would have been
            impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well. His first wooing had been of the tempestuous
            order, and he looked back upon it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion blended
            with regret. He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one of the bit tersweet experiences of his life,
            for which he could be grateful when the pain was over. His second wooing, he resolved, should be as calm and
            simple as possible: there was no need of having a scene, hardly any need of telling Amy that he loved her,
            she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago. It all came about so naturally that no one
            could complain, and he knew that everybody would be pleased, even Jo. But when our first little passion has
            been crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so Laurie let the days pass, enjoying
            every hour, and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest
            part of his new romance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had rather imagined that the denouement would take place in the ch&acirc;teau garden by moonlight, and in
            the most graceful and decorous manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was settled on
            the lake at noonday in a few blunt words. They had been floating about all the morning, from gloomy St.
            Gingolf to sunny Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St. Bernard and the Dent du Midi on the
            other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne upon the hill beyond,<u><sup>20</sup></u> a cloudless blue
            sky overhead, and the bluer lake below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged gulls.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of Rousseau, as they looked up at
            Clarens, where he wrote his H&eacute;loise.<u><sup>21</sup></u> Neither had read it, but they knew it was a
            love story, and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own. Amy had been dabbling
            her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them, and, when she looked up, Laurie was
            leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for the sake of saying
            something&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You must be tired; rest a little, and let me row; it will do me good; for since you came I have been
            altogether lazy and luxurious.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like. There&rsquo;s room enough, though I have to
            sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won&rsquo;t trim,&rdquo; returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the
            arrangement.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered third of a seat, shook her hair over her
            face, and accepted an oar. She rowed as</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>well as she did many other things; and, though she used both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time,
            and the boat went smoothly through the water.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How well we pull together, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; said Amy, who objected to silence just then.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you, Amy?&rdquo; very tenderly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Laurie,&rdquo; very low.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to
            the dissolving views reflected in the lake.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>42</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All Alone</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in another, and heart and soul were purified
            by a sweet example; but when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone,
            and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo found her promise very hard to keep. How could she
            &ldquo;comfort Father and Mother&rdquo; when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister,
            how could she &ldquo;make the house cheerful&rdquo; when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have
            deserted it when Beth left the old home for the new, and where in all the world could she &ldquo;find some
            useful, happy work to do,&rdquo; that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own
            reward? She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for
            it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life get harder and
            harder as she toiled along. Some people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow; it was not fair,
            for she tried more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble, and hard
            work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending
            all her life in that quiet house, devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that never
            seemed to grow any easier. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it. I wasn&rsquo;t meant for a life like this, and I know
            I shall break away and do something desperate if somebody doesn&rsquo;t come and help me,&rdquo; she said to
            herself, when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind which often
            comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore
            familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity. Often she started up at night,
            thinking Beth called her; and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of an
            unsubmissive sorrow, &ldquo;Oh, Beth, come back! Come back!&rdquo; she did not stretch out her yearning arms
            in vain; for, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sister&rsquo;s faintest whisper, her
            mother came to comfort her, not with words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears
            that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo&lsquo;s, and broken whispers, more eloquent than
            prayers, because hopeful resignation went hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart
            talked to heart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing, which chastened grief and
            strengthened love. Feeling this, Jo&rsquo;s burden seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked
            more endurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found help, for one day she went to the
            study, and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said, very
            humbly, &ldquo;Father, talk to me as you did to Beth. I need it more than she did, for I&rsquo;m all
            wrong.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My dear, nothing can comfort me like this,&rdquo; he answered, with a falter in his voice, and both
            arms round her, as if he, too, needed help, and did not fear to ask it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then, sitting in Beth&rsquo;s little chair close beside him, Jo told her troubles&mdash;the resentful sorrow
            for her loss, the fruitless efforts that discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and
            all the sad bewilderment which we call despair. She gave him entire confidence, he gave her the help she
            needed, and both found consolation in the act; for the time had come when they could talk together not only
            as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well
            as mutual love. Happy, thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called &ldquo;the church of one
            member,&rdquo; and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered cheerfulness, and a more submissive
            spirit; for the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach
            another to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its beautiful opportunities with
            gratitude and power.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Other helps had Jo&mdash;humble, wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving
            her, and which she slowly learned to see and value. Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as
            they once had been, for Beth had presided over both; and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to
            linger round the little mop and the old brush, that was never thrown away. As she used them, Jo found
            herself humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth&rsquo;s orderly ways, and giving the little
            touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cozy, which was the first step toward making home
            happy, though she didn&rsquo;t know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You thoughtful creter, you&rsquo;re determined we shan&rsquo;t miss that dear lamb ef you can help it.
            We don&rsquo;t say much, but we see it, and the Lord will bless you for&lsquo;t, see ef He
            don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her sister Meg was, how well she could talk, how
            much she knew about good, womanly impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was in husband and
            children, and how much they were all doing for each other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Marriage is an excellent thing, after all. I wonder if I should blossom out half as well as you have,
            if I tried it?&rdquo; said Jo, as she constructed a kite for Demi in the topsy-turvy nursery.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your nature, Jo. You are like a
            chestnut burr, prickly outside, but silky-soft within, and a sweet kernel, if one can only get at it. Love
            will make you show your heart some day, and then the rough burr will fall off.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Frost opens chestnut burrs, ma&lsquo;am, and it takes a good shake to bring them down. Boys go
            nutting,<u><sup>km</sup></u> and I don&rsquo;t care to be bagged by them,&rdquo; returned Jo, pasting away
            at the kite which no wind that blows would ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a
            bob.<u><sup>kn</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo&rsquo;s old spirit, but she felt it her duty to enforce
            her opinion by every argument in her power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of
            Meg&rsquo;s most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly. Grief is the best opener for
            some hearts, and Jo&rsquo;s was nearly ready for the bag: a little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not
            a boy&rsquo;s impatient shake, but a man&rsquo;s hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr, and find
            the kernel sound and sweet. If she had suspected this, she would have shut up tight, and been more prickly
            than ever, fortunately she wasn&rsquo;t thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she dropped.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she ought at this period of her life to have become
            quite saintly, renounced the world, and gone about doing good in a mortified<u><sup>ko</sup></u> bonnet,
            with tracts in her pocket. But, you see, Jo wasn&rsquo;t a heroine, she was only a struggling human girl
            like hundreds of others, and she just acted out her nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the
            mood suggested. It&rsquo;s highly virtuous to say we&rsquo;ll be good, but we can&rsquo;t do it all at once,
            and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together, before some of us even get our feet set in
            the right way. Jo had got so far, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if she did not; but
            to do it cheerfully&mdash;ah, that was another thing! She had often said she wanted to do something
            splendid, no matter how hard; and now she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to devote her
            life to Father and Mother, trying to make home as happy to them as they had to her? And if difficulties were
            necessary to increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl than
            to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for others?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Providence had taken her at her word; here was the task, not what she had expected, but better because self
            had no part in it: now, could she do it? She decided that she would try, and in her first attempt she found
            the helps I have suggested. Still another was given her, and she took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort,
            as Christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested, as he climbed the hill
            called Difficulty.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write? That always used to make you happy,&rdquo; said her mother once, when the
            desponding fit overshadowed Jo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my
            things.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We do. Write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world. Try it, dear, I&rsquo;m sure it
            would do you good, and please us very much.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe I can.&rdquo; But Jo got out
            her desk and began to overhaul her half-finished manuscripts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was, scratching away, with her black pinafore on, and an
            absorbed expression, which caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased with the success of her
            suggestion. Jo never knew how it happened, but something got into that story that went straight to the
            hearts of those who read it, for when her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it, much
            against her will, to one of the popular magazines, and, to her utter surprise, it was not only paid for, but
            others requested. Letters from several persons, whose praise was honor, followed the appearance of the
            little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as well as friends admired it. For a small thing it was a
            great success, and Jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it. What can there be in a simple little story like that to make people
            praise it so?&rdquo; she said, quite bewildered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There is truth in it, Jo, that&rsquo;s the secret; humor and pathos make it alive, and you have found
            your style at last. You wrote with no thought of fame or money, and put your heart into it, my daughter; you
            have had the bitter, now comes the sweet. Do your best, and grow as happy as we are in your success. &rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If there is anything good or true in what I write, it isn&rsquo;t mine; I owe it all to you and Mother
            and to Beth,&rdquo; said Jo, more touched by her father&rsquo;s words than by any amount of praise from the
            world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent them away to make friends for themselves
            and her, finding it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers; for they were kindly welcomed, and
            sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that Jo would find it difficult to rejoice
            over it, but her fears were soon set at rest; for, though Jo looked grave at first, she took it very
            quietly, and was full of hopes and plans for &ldquo;the children&rdquo; before she read the letter twice. It
            was a sort of written duet, wherein each glorified the other in loverlike fashion, very pleasant to read and
            satisfactory to think of, for no one had any objection to make.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You like it, Mother?&rdquo; said Jo, as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one
            another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had refused Fred. I felt sure then that
            something better than what you call the &lsquo;mercenary spirit&rsquo; had come over her, and a hint here
            and there in her letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent! You never said a word to me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have girls to manage. I was half afraid
            to put the idea into your head, lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was
            settled.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the scatterbrain I was; you may trust me, I&rsquo;m sober and sensible enough for
            anyone&rsquo;s confidante now.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied it might pain you to learn that
            your Teddy loved anyone else.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and
            selfish, after I&rsquo;d refused his love, when it was freshest, if not best?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he came back, and asked again, you
            might, perhaps, feel like giving another answer. Forgive me, dear, I can&rsquo;t help seeing that you are
            very lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart; so I fancied that your
            boy might fill the empty place if he tried now.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, Mother, it is better as it is, and I&rsquo;m glad Amy has learned to love him. But you are right
            in one thing: I am lonely, and perhaps if Teddy had tried again, I might have said &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; not
            because I love him any more, but because I care more to be loved than when he went away.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are plenty to love you, so try
            to be satisfied with Father and Mother, sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all
            comes to give you your reward.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mothers are the best lovers in the world, but I don&rsquo;t mind whispering to Marmee that I&rsquo;d
            like to try all kinds. It&rsquo;s very curious, but the more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of
            natural affections, the more I seem to want. I&rsquo;d no idea hearts could take in so many; mine is so
            elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite contented with my family. I don&rsquo;t understand
            it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; And Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back the leaves to read what Amy said
            of Laurie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me; he isn&rsquo;t sentimental, doesn&rsquo;t say much
            about it, but I see and feel it in all he says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I
            don&rsquo;t seem to be the same girl I was. I never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now,
            for he lets me read his heart, and I find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud
            to know it&rsquo;s mine. He says he feels as if he &lsquo;could make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard
            as mate, and lots of love for ballast.&rsquo; I pray he may, and try to be all he believes me, for I love my
            gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while God lets us be
            together. Oh, Mother, I never knew how much like heaven this world could be, when two people love and live
            for one another!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy! Truly, love does work miracles. How very, very
            happy they must be!&rdquo; And Jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut
            the covers of a lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he finds himself alone
            in the workaday world again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not walk. A restless spirit possessed her,
            and the old feeling came again, not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister
            should have all she asked, the other nothing. It was not true, she knew that and tried to put it away, but
            the natural craving for affection was strong, and Amy&rsquo;s happiness woke the hungry longing for some one
            to &ldquo;love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them be together.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Up in the garret, where Jo&rsquo;s unquiet wanderings ended stood four little wooden chests in a row, each
            marked with its owner&rsquo;s name, and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for
            all. Jo glanced into them, and when she came to her own, leaned her chin on the edge, and stared absently at
            the chaotic collection, till a bundle of old exercise books caught her eye. She drew them out, turned them
            over, and relived that pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke&rsquo;s. She had smiled at first, then she looked
            thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a little message written in the Professor&rsquo;s hand, her lips
            began to tremble, the books slid out of her lap, and she sat looking at the friendly words, as if they took
            a new meaning, and touched a tender spot in her heart.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Wait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall surely come.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, if he only would! So kind, so good, so patient with me always; my dear old Fritz, I didn&rsquo;t
            value him half enough when I had him, but now how I should love to see him, for everyone seems going away
            from me, and I&rsquo;m all alone.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet to be fulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a
            comfortable rag bag, and cried, as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Was it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits? Or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its
            time as patiently as its inspirer? Who shall say?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>43</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Surprises</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the fire, and thinking. It was her favorite
            way of spending the hour of dusk; no one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth&rsquo;s little red
            pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far
            away. Her face looked tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her birthday, and she was thinking how
            fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and how little she seemed to have accomplished. Almost
            twenty-five, and nothing to show for it. Jo was mistaken in that; there was a good deal to show, and
            by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;An old maid, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m to be. A literary spinster, with a pen for a spouse, a family
            of stories for children, and twenty years hence a morsel of fame, perhaps; when, like poor Johnson,
            I&rsquo;m old, and can&rsquo;t enjoy it, solitary, and can&rsquo;t share it, independent, and don&rsquo;t
            need it.<u><sup>kp</sup></u> Well, I needn&rsquo;t be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say,
            old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it, but&mdash;&rdquo; And there Jo sighed, as if the
            prospect was not inviting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to five-and-twenty; but it&rsquo;s not so bad
            as it looks, and one can get on quite happily if one has something in one&rsquo;s self to fall back upon. At
            twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly resolve that they never will be; at
            thirty they say nothing about it, but quietly accept the fact, and, if sensible, console themselves by
            remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which they may be learning to grow old
            gracefully. Don&rsquo;t laugh at the spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragic romances are
            hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns, and many silent sacrifices of youth,
            health, ambition, love itself, make the faded faces beautiful in God&rsquo;s sight. Even the sad, sour
            sisters should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest part of life, if for no other
            reason; and, looking at them with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember that they
            too may miss the blossom time; that rosy cheeks don&rsquo;t last forever, that silver threads will come in
            the bonnie brown hair, and that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration
            now.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter how poor and plain and prim, for the
            only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble,
            and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. Just recollect the good aunts who have not only
            lectured and fussed, but nursed and petted, too often without thanks; the scrapes they have helped you out
            of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches the patient old fingers have set for
            you, the steps the willing old feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions
            that women love to receive as long as they live. The bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and
            will like you all the better for them; and if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son,
            should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt
            Priscilla, who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for &ldquo;the best nevvy in the
            world.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this little homily), for suddenly
            Laurie&rsquo;s ghost seemed to stand before her&mdash;a substantial, lifelike ghost&mdash;leaning over her
            with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn&rsquo;t like to show it. But, like
            Jenny in the ballad&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She could not think it he,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and kissed her. Then she knew him, and flew
            up, crying joyfully&mdash; &ldquo;O my Teddy! O my Teddy!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Glad! My blessed boy, words can&rsquo;t express my gladness. Where&rsquo;s Amy?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your mother has got her down at Meg&rsquo;s. We stopped there by the way, and there was no getting my
            wife out of their clutches.&rdquo; &ldquo;Your what?&rdquo; cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words
            with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him. &ldquo;Oh, the dickens! Now I&rsquo;ve done
            it.&rdquo; And he looked so guilty that Jo was down upon him like a flash. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone and got
            married!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, please, but I never will again.&rdquo; And he went down upon his knees, with a penitent clasping
            of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth, and triumph. &ldquo;Actually married?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Very much so, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Mercy on us! What dreadful thing will you do next?&rdquo; And Jo fell into her seat with a gasp.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,&rdquo; returned Laurie, still in an
            abject attitude, but beaming with satisfaction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What can you expect, when you take one&rsquo;s breath away, creeping in like a burglar, and letting
            cats out of bags like that? Get up, you ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to barricade.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted the sofa invitingly, as she said in a
            cordial tone, &ldquo;The old pillow is up garret, and we don&rsquo;t need it now; so, come and fess,
            Teddy.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How good it sounds to hear you say &lsquo;Teddy&rsquo;! No one ever calls me that but you.&rdquo; And
            Laurie sat down with an air of great content.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What does Amy call you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My lord.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like her. Well, you look it.&rdquo; And Jo&rsquo;s eye plainly betrayed that she found
            her boy comelier than ever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless&mdash;a natural one, raised by time, absence,
            and change of heart. Both felt it, and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast
            a little shadow over them. It was gone directly, however, for Laurie said, with a vain attempt at
            dignity&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I look like a married man and the head of a family?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not a bit, and you never will. You&rsquo;ve grown bigger and bonnier, but you are the same
            scapegrace<u><sup>kq</sup></u> as ever.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now, really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more
            respect,&rdquo; began Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so irresistibly funny that I can&rsquo;t
            keep sober!&rdquo; answered Jo, smiling all over her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and
            then settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all coming up presently. I
            couldn&rsquo;t wait; I wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise, and have &lsquo;first
            skim,&rsquo; as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong end. Now, start right, and tell me
            how it all happened. I&rsquo;m pining to know.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I did it to please Amy,&rdquo; began
            Laurie, with a twinkle that made Jo exclaim&mdash; &ldquo;Fib number one. Amy did it to please you. Go on,
            and tell the truth, if you can, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now she&rsquo;s beginning to marm it;<u><sup>kr</sup></u> isn&rsquo;t it jolly to hear her?&rdquo;
            said Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the
            same, you know, she and I being one. We planned to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they
            suddenly changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris. But Grandpa wanted to come home;
            he went to please me, and I couldn&rsquo;t let him go alone, neither could I leave Amy; and Mrs. Carrol had
            got English notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn&rsquo;t let Amy come with us. So I just
            settled the difficulty by saying, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s be married, and then we can do as we
            like.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course you did; you always have things to suit you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not always.&rdquo; And something in Laurie&rsquo;s voice made Jo say hastily&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How did you ever get Aunt to agree?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It was hard work, but, between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps of good reasons on our side.
            There wasn&rsquo;t time to write and ask leave, but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it
            was only &lsquo;taking Time by the fetlock,&rsquo; as my wife says.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we proud of those two words, and don&rsquo;t we like to say them?&rdquo; interrupted Jo,
            addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes
            that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A trifle, perhaps, she&rsquo;s such a captivating little woman I can&rsquo;t help being proud of her.
            Well, then, Uncle and Aunt were there to play propriety; we were so absorbed in one another we were of no
            mortal use apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all round, so we did it.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;When, where, how?&rdquo; asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity, for she could not
            realize it a particle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Six weeks ago, at the American consul&lsquo;s, in Paris; a very quiet wedding, of course, for even in
            our happiness we didn&rsquo;t forget dear little Beth.&rdquo; Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and
            Laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow, which he remembered well. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let us
            know afterward?&rdquo; asked Jo, in a quieter tone, when they had sat quite still a minute.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We wanted to surprise you; we thought we were coming directly home, at first; but the dear old
            gentleman, as soon as we were married, found he couldn&rsquo;t be ready under a month, at least, and sent us
            off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular honeymoon home, so we
            went there, and were as happy as people are but once in their lives. My faith! Wasn&rsquo;t it love among
            the roses!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, for the fact that he told her these things so
            freely and naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away her hand,
            but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said,
            with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we&rsquo;ll put it by forever. As I told you in my letter
            when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me, I never shall stop loving you; but the love is altered, and I
            have learned to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you changed places in my heart, that&rsquo;s all. I
            think it was meant to be so, and would have come about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me;
            but I never could be patient, and so I got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong and violent; and it
            took a hard lesson to show me my mistake. For it was one, Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after making
            a fool of myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that I didn&rsquo;t know which
            I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love both alike; but I couldn&lsquo;t, and when I saw her in
            Switzerland, everything seemed to clear up all at once. You both got into your right places, and I felt sure
            that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new; that I could honestly share my heart
            between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them both dearly. Will you believe it, and go back to the happy old
            times when we first knew one another?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be boy and girl again: the happy
            old times can&rsquo;t come back, and we mustn&rsquo;t expect it. We are man and woman now, with sober work
            to do, for playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking. I&rsquo;m sure you feel this. I see the change
            in you, and you&rsquo;ll find it in me. I shall miss my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire
            him more, because he means to be what I hoped he would. We can&rsquo;t be little playmates any longer, but
            we will be brother and sister, to love and help one another all our lives, won&rsquo;t we, Laurie?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his face down on it for a minute, feeling
            that out of the grave of a boyish passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them
            both. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn&rsquo;t want the coming home to be a sad one, &ldquo;I
            can&rsquo;t make it true that you children are really married, and going to set up housekeeping. Why, it
            seems only yesterday that I was buttoning Amy&rsquo;s pinafore, and pulling your hair when you teased. Mercy
            me, how time does fly!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn&rsquo;t talk so like a grandma. I flatter
            myself I&rsquo;m a &lsquo;gentleman growed,&rsquo; as Peggotty said of David<u><sup>ks</sup></u> and when
            you see Amy, you&rsquo;ll find her rather a precocious infant,&rdquo; said Laurie, looking amused at her
            maternal air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You may be a little older in years, but I&rsquo;m ever so much older in feeling, Teddy. Women always
            are, and this last year has been such a hard one that I feel forty.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Poor Jo! We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You are older; here&rsquo;s a line,
            and there&rsquo;s another; unless you smile, your eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I
            found a tear on it. You&rsquo;ve had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone. What a selfish
            beast I&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo; And Laurie pulled his own hair, with a remorseful look.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone which she tried to make quite
            cheerful, &ldquo;No, I had Father and Mother to help me, the dear babies to comfort me, and the thought that
            you and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles here easier to bear. I am lonely, sometimes, but I
            dare say it&rsquo;s good for me, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You never shall be again,&rdquo; broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her, as if to fence out every
            human ill. &ldquo;Amy and I can&rsquo;t get on without you, so you must come and teach &lsquo;the
            children&rsquo; to keep house, and go halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and
            all be blissfully happy and friendly together.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If I shouldn&rsquo;t be in the way, it would be very pleasant. I begin to feel quite young already,
            for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came. You always were a comfort, Teddy.&rdquo; And
            Jo leaned her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill and Laurie told her to hold
            on to him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was smiling to herself, as if, in truth,
            her troubles had all vanished at his coming. &ldquo;You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one
            minute, and laughing the next. You look a little wicked now. What is it, Grandma?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Like angels!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, at first, but which rules?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that she does, now, at least I let her think so&mdash;it pleases her,
            you know. By-and-by we shall take turns, for marriage, they say, halves one&rsquo;s rights and doubles
            one&rsquo;s duties.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your life.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don&rsquo;t think I shall mind much. She is the sort of
            woman who knows how to rule well; in fact, I rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly
            and prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it!&rdquo; cried Jo, with uplifted
            hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he
            replied, with his &ldquo;high and mighty&rdquo; air, &ldquo;Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the
            sort of man to submit to it. My wife and I respect ourselves and one another too much ever to tyrannize or
            quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man,
            and regret mingled with her pleasure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I am sure of that. Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She is the sun and I the wind, in the
            fable, and the sun managed the man best, you remember.&rdquo;<u><sup>kt</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She can blow him up as well as shine on him,&rdquo; laughed Laurie. &ldquo;Such a lecture as I got at
            Nice! I give you my word it was a deal worse than any of your scoldings&mdash;a regular rouser. I&rsquo;ll
            tell you all about it sometime&mdash;she never will, because after telling me that she despised and was
            ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and married the good-for-nothing.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What baseness! Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I&rsquo;ll defend you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I look as if I needed it, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said Laurie, getting up and striking an attitude which
            suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous, as Amy&rsquo;s voice was heard calling, &ldquo;Where is
            she? Where&rsquo;s my dear old Jo?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all over again, and, after several vain
            attempts, the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over. Mr. Laurence, hale and hearty
            as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour, for the crustiness seemed to be
            nearly gone, and the old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever. It
            was good to see him beam at &ldquo;my children,&rdquo; as he called the young pair; it was better still to
            see Amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart; and best of all, to
            watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own dress hadn&rsquo;t a Parisian air,
            that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that &ldquo;her
            ladyship&rdquo; was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman. Jo thought, as she watched the pair,
            &ldquo;How well they look together! I was right, and Laurie has found the beautiful, accomplished girl who
            will become his home better than clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him.&rdquo; Mrs. March and
            her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they saw that their youngest had done
            well, not only in worldly things, but the better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For Amy&rsquo;s face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful heart, her voice had a new
            tenderness in it, and the cool, prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and winning. No
            little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty
            or the old grace, for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had
            hoped to become.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Love has done much for our little girl,&rdquo; said her mother softly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,&rdquo; Mr. March whispered back, with a
            loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her &ldquo;pitty aunty,&rdquo; but attached herself like a lap
            dog to the wonderful chatelaine<u><sup>ku</sup></u> full of delightful charms. Demi paused to consider the
            new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took the tempting
            form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank movement produced an unconditional surrender, however,
            for Laurie knew where to have him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face: now I demand
            the satisfaction of a gentleman,&rdquo; and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small
            nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Blest if she ain&rsquo;t in silk from head to foot? Ain&rsquo;t it a relishin&rsquo; sight to see her
            settin&rsquo; there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks calling little Amy, Mis.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurence?&rdquo; muttered old Hannah, who could not resist frequent peeks through the slide as she set the
            table in a most decidedly promiscuous manner.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mercy on us, how they did talk! First one, then the other, then all burst put together, trying to tell the
            history of three years in half an hour. It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and provide
            refreshment, for they would have been hoarse and faint if they had gone on much longer. Such a happy
            procession as filed away into the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted &ldquo;Mrs.
            Laurence.&rdquo; Mrs. March as proudly leaned on the arm of &ldquo;my son.&rdquo; The old gentleman took Jo,
            with a whispered &ldquo;You must be my girl now,&rdquo; and a glance at the empty corner by the fire, that
            made Jo whisper back, with trembling lips, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to fill her place sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for everyone was so busy with the
            newcomers that they were left to revel at their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of
            the opportunity. Didn&rsquo;t they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread ad libitum,<u><sup>kv</sup></u> get
            a hot biscuit apiece, and, as a crowning trespass, didn&rsquo;t they each whisk a captivating little tart
            into their tiny pockets, there to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human nature and
            pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts, and fearing that
            Dodo&rsquo;s sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty, the
            little sinners attached themselves to &ldquo;Dranpa,&rdquo; who hadn&rsquo;t his spectacles on. Amy, who was
            handed about like refreshments, returned to the parlor on Father Laurence&rsquo;s arm; the others paired off
            as before, and this arrangement left Jo companionless. She did not mind it at the minute, for she lingered
            to answer Hannah&rsquo;s eager inquiry.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely silver dishes that&rsquo;s stored away
            over yander?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate, and wore diamonds and point
            lace<u><sup>kw</sup></u> every day. Teddy thinks nothing too good for her,&rdquo; returned Jo with infinite
            satisfaction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No more there is! Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?&rdquo; asked Hannah, who wisely
            mingled poetry and prose.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; And Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an uncongenial topic just then.
            She stood a minute looking at the party vanishing above, and, as Demi&rsquo;s short plaid legs toiled up the
            last stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes,
            as if to find something to lean upon, for even Teddy had deserted her. If she had known what birthday gift
            was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll weep a
            little weep when I go to bed; it won&rsquo;t do to be dismal now.&rdquo; Then she drew her hand over her
            eyes&mdash;for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was&mdash;and had just
            managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She opened it with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her, for there
            stood a tall bearded gentleman, beaming on</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>her from the darkness like a midnight sun.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!&rdquo; cried Jo, with a clutch, as if she feared the night
            would swallow him up before she could get him in.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And I to see Miss Marsch&mdash;but no, you haf a party&mdash;&rdquo; And the Professor paused as the
            sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, we haven&lsquo;t, only the family. My sister and friends have just come home, and we are all very
            happy. Come in, and make one of us.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously away, and come again another day; but
            how could he, when Jo shut the door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had something to
            do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him, and showed it with a frankness that proved
            irresistible to the solitary man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop,<u><sup>kx</sup></u> I will so gladly see them all. You haf been
            ill, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light fell on her face, and he saw a change in
            it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since I saw you last.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that.&rdquo; And he shook hands again, with
            such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of
            the big, warm hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer,&rdquo; she said, with a face and tone of such
            irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a
            flourish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the stranger had had any doubts about his reception, they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial
            welcome he received. Everyone greeted him kindly, for Jo&rsquo;s sake at first, but very soon they liked him
            for his own. They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that opens all hearts, and these simple
            people warmed to him at once, feeling even the more friendly because he was poor; for poverty enriches those
            who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with
            the air of a traveler who knocks at a strange door, and, when it opens, finds himself at home. The children
            went to him like bees to a honeypot, and establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him by
            rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his watch, with juvenile audacity. The women
            telegraphed their approval to one another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred spirit, opened
            his choicest stores for his guest&rsquo;s benefit, while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but said
            not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie&rsquo;s behavior would have amused her; for a faint twinge, not
            of jealousy, but something like suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe the
            newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long. He got interested in spite of himself,
            and, before he knew it, was drawn into the circle; for Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere, and
            did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him often, and a shadow would pass across
            his face, as if regretting his own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime. Then his eye would
            turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it; but Jo had
            her own eyes to take care of, and, feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept them on the
            little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk, for the sidelong
            peeps showed her several propitious omens. Mr. Bhaer&rsquo;s face had lost the absent-minded expression, and
            looked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting
            to compare him with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment. Then he seemed quite
            inspired, though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be
            considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and
            thought to herself, as she watched her father&rsquo;s absorbed face, &ldquo;How he would enjoy having such a
            man as my Professor to talk with every day!&rdquo; Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black,
            which made him look more like a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed, but
            didn&rsquo;t stay in order long, for, in exciting moments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do;
            and Jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a
            Jove-like<u><sup>ky</sup></u> aspect. Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she sat knitting away
            so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold
            sleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dear old fellow! He couldn&rsquo;t have got himself up with more care if he&rsquo;d been going
            a-wooing,&rdquo; said Jo to herself, and then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so
            dreadfully that she had to drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for though just in the act of setting fire to
            a funeral pile, the Professor dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the little
            blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads smartly together, saw stars, and both came up flushed and
            laughing, without the ball, to resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted<u><sup>kz</sup></u> the babies at an
            early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr. Laurence went home to rest. The others sat round the
            fire, talking away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal mind was impressed
            with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of bed, and Demi set his nightgown afire studying the
            structure of matches, made a move to go.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together again once more,&rdquo; said Jo,
            feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were not all there. But no one found the words thoughtless or untrue; for Beth still seemed among them,
            a peaceful presence, invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the household league that
            love made dissoluble. The little chair stood in its old place; the tidy basket, with the bit of work she
            left unfinished when the needle grew &ldquo;so heavy,&rdquo; was still on its accustomed shelf; the beloved
            instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved; and above it Beth&rsquo;s face, serene and smiling, as in
            the early days, looked down upon them, seeming to say, &ldquo;Be happy. I am here.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Play something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved,&rdquo; said Laurie, with pardonable
            pride in his promising pupil. But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool, &ldquo;Not
            tonight, dear. I can&rsquo;t show off tonight.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she sang Beth&rsquo;s songs with a tender
            music in her voice which the best master could not have taught, and touched the listeners&rsquo; hearts with
            a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her. The room was very still, when the clear
            voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth&rsquo;s favorite hymn. It was hard to say-</p>
        <p>Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;<u><sup>la</sup></u></p>
        <p>and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect
            without Beth&rsquo;s kiss.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, we must finish with Mignon&rsquo;s song,<u><sup>lb</sup></u> for Mr. Bhaer sings that,&rdquo;
            said Jo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo;
            as he stepped into the corner where Jo stood, saying&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You will sing with me? We go excellently well together.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music than a grasshopper. But she would have
            consented if he had proposed to sing a whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and
            tune. It didn&rsquo;t much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily and well, and Jo soon
            subsided into a subdued hum, that she might listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Know&lsquo;st thou the land where the citron blooms,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>used to be the Professor&rsquo;s favorite line, for &ldquo;das land&rdquo; meant Germany to him; but now he
            seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody, upon the words&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There, oh there, might I with thee,</p>
        <p>O my beloved, go</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land, and
            would joyfully depart thither whenever he liked.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered with laurels. But a few minutes
            afterward, he forgot his manners entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet; for she had been
            introduced simply as &ldquo;my sister,&rdquo; and no one had called her by her new name since he came. He
            forgot himself still further when Laurie said, in his most gracious manner, at parting&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My wife and I are very glad to meet you sir. Please remember that there is always a welcome waiting
            for you over the way.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie
            thought him the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me leave, dear madame, for a little
            business in the city will keep me here some days.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo; and the mother&rsquo;s voice gave as cordial an assent as did
            the daughter&rsquo;s eyes, for Mrs. March was not so blind to her children&rsquo;s interest as Mrs. Moffat
            supposed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I suspect that is a wise man,&rdquo; remarked Mr. March, with placid satisfaction, from the hearthrug,
            after the last guest had gone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know he is a good one,&rdquo; added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as she wound up the clock.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d like him,&rdquo; was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her bed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city, and finally decided that he had been
            appointed to some great honor, somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If she had seen his
            face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal
            of hair, who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the subject,
            especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture in the dark.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>44</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Lord and Lady</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Please, Madame Mother, could you lend me my wife for half an hour? The luggage has come, and I&rsquo;ve been
            making hay of Amy&rsquo;s Paris finery, trying to find some things I want,&rdquo; said Laurie, coming in the
            next day to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother&rsquo;s lap, as if being made &ldquo;the baby&rdquo;
            again.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Certainly. Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but this.&rdquo; And Mrs. March pressed the white
            hand that wore the wedding ring, as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have come over if I could have helped it; but I can&rsquo;t get on without my little
            woman any more than a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Weathercock can without wind,&rdquo; suggested Jo, as he paused for a simile. Jo had grown quite her
            own saucy self again since Teddy came home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Exactly, for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with only an occasional whiffle round to
            the south, and I haven&rsquo;t had an easterly spell since I was married; don&rsquo;t know anything about
            the north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Lovely weather so far; I don&rsquo;t know how long it will last, but I&rsquo;m not afraid of storms,
            for I&rsquo;m learning how to sail my ship. Come home, dear, and I&rsquo;ll find your
            bootjack;<u><sup>lc</sup></u> I suppose that&rsquo;s what you are rummaging after among my things. Men are
            so helpless, Mother,&rdquo; said Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted her husband.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?&rdquo; asked Jo, buttoning Amy&rsquo;s
            cloak as she used to button her pinafores.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We have our plans; we don&rsquo;t mean to say much about them yet, because we are such very new
            brooms, but we don&rsquo;t intend to be idle. I&rsquo;m going into business with a devotion that shall
            delight Grandfather, and prove to him that I&rsquo;m not spoiled. I need something of the sort to keep me
            steady. I&rsquo;m tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And Amy, what is she going to do?&rdquo; asked Mrs. March, well pleased at Laurie&rsquo;s decision and
            the energy with which he spoke.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall astonish you by the elegant
            hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we
            shall exert over the world at large. That&rsquo;s about it, isn&rsquo;t it, Madame
            Recamier?&rdquo;<u><sup>ld</sup></u> asked Laurie, with a quizzical look at Amy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Time will show. Come away, Impertinence, and don&rsquo;t shock my family by calling me names before
            their faces,&rdquo; answered Amy, resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she
            set up a salon as a queen of society.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How happy those children seem together!&rdquo; observed Mr. March, finding it difficult to become
            absorbed in his Aristotle<u><sup>le</sup></u> after the young couple had gone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, and I think it will last,&rdquo; added Mrs. March, with the restful expression of a pilot who has
            brought a ship safely into port.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I know it will. Happy Amy!&rdquo; And Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as Professor Bhaer opened the
            gate with an impatient push.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his
            wife, who was flitting about, arranging her new art treasures, &ldquo;Mrs. Laurence.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My lord!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That man intends to marry our Jo!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hope so, don&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that expressive word, but I do wish he
            was a little younger and a good deal richer.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, Laurie, don&rsquo;t be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love one another it
            doesn&rsquo;t matter a particle how old they are nor how poor. Women never should marry for
            money&mdash;&rdquo; Amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who
            replied, with malicious gravity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend to do it sometimes. If my memory
            serves me, you once thought it your duty to make a rich match; that accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a
            good-for-nothing like me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, my dearest boy, don&lsquo;t, don&rsquo;t say that! I forgot you were rich when I said
            &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; I&rsquo;d have married you if you hadn&rsquo;t a penny, and I sometimes wish you were
            poor that I might show how much I love you.&rdquo; And Amy, who was very dignified in public and very fond
            in private, gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be once, do you? It would
            break my heart if you didn&rsquo;t believe that I&rsquo;d gladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you
            had to get your living by rowing on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Am I an idiot and a brute? How could I think so, when you refused a richer man for me, and won&rsquo;t
            let me give you half I want to now, when I have the right? Girls do it every day, poor things, and are
            taught to think it is their only salvation; but you had better lessons, and, though I trembled for you at
            one time, I was not disappointed, for the daughter was true to the mother&rsquo;s teaching. I told Mamma so
            yesterday, and she looked as glad and grateful as if I&rsquo;d given her a check for a million, to be spent
            in charity. You are not listening to my moral remarks, Mrs. Laurence.&rdquo; And Laurie paused, for
            Amy&rsquo;s eyes had an absent look, though fixed upon his face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, and admiring the dimple in your chin at the same time. I don&rsquo;t wish to make you vain,
            but I must confess that I&rsquo;m prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money. Don&rsquo;t laugh,
            but your nose is such a comfort to me.&rdquo; And Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature with artistic
            satisfaction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that suited him better, as he plainly showed
            though he did laugh at his wife&rsquo;s peculiar taste, while she said slowly, &ldquo;May I ask you a
            question, dear?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Of course you may.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the trouble, is it? I thought there was something in the dimple that didn&rsquo;t
            suit you. Not being a dog in the manger,<u><sup>lf</sup></u> but the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I
            can dance at Jo&rsquo;s wedding with a heart as light as my heels. Do you doubt it, my darling?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied; her last little jealous fear vanished forever, and she thanked him,
            with a face full of love and confidence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn&rsquo;t we invent a rich relation,
            who shall obligingly die out there in Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?&rdquo; said Laurie, when
            they began to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in arm, as they were fond of doing, in memory of
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the ch&acirc;teau garden.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo would find us out, and spoil it all; she is very proud of him, just as he is, and said yesterday
            that she thought poverty was a beautiful thing.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Bless her dear heart! She won&rsquo;t think so when she has a literary husband, and a dozen little
            professors and professorins to support. We won&rsquo;t interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a
            good turn in spite of themselves. I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she believes in people&rsquo;s
            paying their honest debts, so I&rsquo;ll get round her in that way.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn&rsquo;t it? That was always one of my dreams, to
            have the power of giving freely, and, thanks to you, the dream has come true.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah, we&rsquo;ll do quantities of good, won&rsquo;t we? There&rsquo;s one sort of poverty that I
            particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly, because
            they won&rsquo;t ask, and people don&rsquo;t dare to offer charity; yet there are a thousand ways of helping
            them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not offend. I must say, I like to serve a
            decayed gentleman better than a blarneying beggar; I suppose it&rsquo;s wrong, but I do, though it is
            harder.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Because it takes a gentleman to do it,&rdquo; added the other member of the domestic admiration
            society.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t deserve that pretty compliment. But I was going to say that
            while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices,
            and enduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid fellows, some of them, working
            like heroes, poor and friendless, but so full of courage, patience, and ambition that I was ashamed of
            myself, and longed to give them a right good lift. Those are people whom it&rsquo;s a satisfaction to help,
            for if they&rsquo;ve got genius, it&rsquo;s an honor to be allowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or
            delayed for want of fuel to keep the pot boiling; if they haven&lsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a pleasure to comfort
            the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it out.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, and there&rsquo;s another class who can&rsquo;t ask, and who suffer in silence. I know
            something of it, for I belonged to it before you made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid in
            the old story. Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see youth, health, and precious
            opportunities go by, just for want of a little help at the right minute. People have been very kind to me;
            and whenever I see girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put out my hand and help them, as I
            was helped.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And so you shall, like an angel as you are!&rdquo; cried Laurie, resolving, with a glow of
            philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic
            tendencies. &ldquo;Rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their money accumulate
            for others to waste. It&rsquo;s not half so sensible to leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the
            money wisely while alive, and enjoy making one&rsquo;s fellow creatures happy with it. We&rsquo;ll have a
            good time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a generous taste.
            Will you be a little Dorcas,<u><sup>lg</sup></u> going about emptying a big basket of comforts, and filling
            it up with good deeds?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;With all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin,<u><sup>lh</sup></u> stopping as you ride
            gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beg gar.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain, and we
            shall get the best of it!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on again, feeling that their pleasant home was
            more homelike because they hoped to brighten other homes, believing that their own feet would walk more
            uprightly along the flowery path before them, if they smoothed rough ways for other feet, and feeling that
            their hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than
            they.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>45</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Daisy and Demi</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Icannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March family, without devoting at least one
            chapter to the two most precious and important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years of
            discretion; for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their rights, and get them, too, which is
            more than many of their elders do. If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoiled by
            adoration, it was these prattling Brookes. Of course they were the most remarkable children ever born, as
            will be shown when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked fluently at twelve months, and at two
            years they took their places at table, and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders. At three,
            Daisy demanded a &ldquo;needler,&rdquo; and actually made a bag with four stitches in it; she likewise set
            up housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of
            pride to Hannah&rsquo;s eyes, while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather, who invented a new mode
            of teaching the alphabet by forming the letters with his arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and
            heels. The boy early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother, for
            he tried to imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition, with his
            &ldquo;sewin-sheen&rdquo;&mdash;a mysterious structure of string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for
            wheels to go &ldquo;wound and wound&rdquo;; also a basket hung over the back of a chair, in which he vainly
            tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who, with feminine devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped
            till rescued, when the young inventor indignantly remarked, &ldquo;Why, Marmar, dat&rsquo;s my lellywaiter,
            and me&rsquo;s trying to pull her up.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well together, and seldom quarreled more than
            thrice a day. Of course, Demi tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other aggressor,
            while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world. A
            rosy, chubby, sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody&rsquo;s heart, and nestled
            there. One of the captivating children, who seem made to be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like
            little goddesses, and produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small virtues were so
            sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully
            human. It was all fair weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little
            nightgown to look out, and say, no matter whether it rained or shone, &ldquo;Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty
            day!&rdquo; Everyone was a friend, and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most
            inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful worshipers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Me loves evvybody,&rdquo; she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in one hand, and her mug in
            the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish the whole world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote would be blessed by the presence of an inmate as
            serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be spared
            a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares. Her
            grandfather often called her &ldquo;Beth,&rdquo; and her grandmother watched over her with untiring
            devotion, as if trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own could see.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know everything, and often getting much
            disturbed because he could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his grandfather, who used to hold Socratic
            conversations<u><sup>li</sup></u> with him, in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to
            the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What makes my legs go, Dranpa?&rdquo; asked the young philosopher, surveying those active portions of
            his frame with a meditative air, while resting after a go-to-bed frolic one night.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your little mind, Demi,&rdquo; replied the sage, stroking the yellow head respectfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What is a little mine?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made the wheels go in my watch when I showed
            it to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Open me. I want to see it go wound.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that any more than you could open the watch. God winds you up, and you go till He
            stops you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Does I?&rdquo; And Demi&rsquo;s brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought.
            &ldquo;Is I wounded up like the watch?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, but I can&rsquo;t show you how, for it is done
            when we don&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Demi felt of his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the watch, and then gravely remarked, &ldquo;I
            dess Dod does it when I&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively that his anxious grandmother said,
            &ldquo;My dear, do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby? He&rsquo;s getting great bumps
            over his eyes, and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to receive true answers. I am not putting the
            thoughts into his head, but helping him unfold those already there. These children are wiser than we are,
            and I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him. Now, Demi, tell me where you keep
            your mind?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the boy had replied like Alcibiades,<u><sup>lj</sup></u> &ldquo;By the gods, Socrates, I cannot
            tell,&rdquo; his grandfather would not have been surprised; but when, after standing a moment on one leg,
            like a meditative young stork, he answered, in a tone of calm conviction, &ldquo;In my little belly,&rdquo;
            the old gentleman could only join in Grandma&rsquo;s laugh, and dismiss the class in metaphysics.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not given convincing proofs that he was a true
            boy, as well as a budding philosopher; for, often, after a discussion which caused Hannah to prophesy, with
            ominous nods, &ldquo;That child ain&rsquo;t long for this world,&rdquo; he would turn about and set her
            fears at rest by some of the pranks with which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract and delight
            their parents&rsquo; souls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them, but what mother was ever proof against the winning wiles,
            the ingenious evasions, or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show themselves
            accomplished Artful Dodgers?<u><sup>lk</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No more raisins, Demi, they&rsquo;ll make you sick,&rdquo; says Mamma to the young person who offers
            his services in the kitchen with unfailing regularity on plum-pudding day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Me likes to be sick.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty cakes.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit, and by-and-by when an opportunity comes to
            redress them, he outwits Mamma by a shrewd bargain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now you have been good children, and I&rsquo;ll play anything you like,&rdquo; says Meg, as she leads
            her assistant cooks upstairs, when the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Truly, Marmar?&rdquo; asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, truly; anything you say,&rdquo; replies the shortsighted parent, preparing herself to sing
            &ldquo;The Three Little Kittens&rdquo; half a dozen times over, or to take her family to &ldquo;Buy a penny
            bun,&rdquo; regardless of wind or limb. But Demi corners her by the cool reply&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go and eat up all the raisins.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children, and the trio turned the little house
            topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy was as yet only a name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory,
            but Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for which compliment she was deeply
            grateful. But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo neglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their
            little souls. Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost her best customer and became
            bankrupt; Demi, with infantile penetration, soon discovered that Dodo liked to play with &ldquo;the
            bear-man&rdquo; better than she did with him; but, though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he
            hadn&rsquo;t the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops in his waistcoat pocket, and a
            watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes; but Demi didn&rsquo;t see it in that
            light, and continued to patronize the &ldquo;bear-man&rdquo; with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed
            her small affections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her throne, his arm her refuge,
            his gifts treasures of surpassing worth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young relatives of ladies whom they
            honor with their regard; but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness<u><sup>ll</sup></u> sits uneasily upon
            them, and does not deceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer&rsquo;s devotion was sincere, however likewise
            effective &mdash;for honesty is the best policy in love as in law; he was one of the men who are at home
            with children, and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one.
            His business, whatever it was, detained him from day to day, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to
            see &mdash;well, he always asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the attraction. The excellent papa
            labored under the delusion that he was, and reveled in long discussions with the kindred spirit, till a
            chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study, astonished by the spectacle that met
            his eye. Prone upon the floor lay Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him, likewise
            prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovelers
            so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh,
            and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Father, Father, here&rsquo;s the Professor!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor said, with undisturbed dignity,
            &ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for a moment; we are just finishing our lesson. Now, Demi, make
            the letter and tell its name.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I knows him!&rdquo; And, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs took the shape of a pair of
            compasses, and the intelligent pupil triumphantly shouted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a We, Dranpa, it&rsquo;s a
            We!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a born Weller,&rdquo; laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself up, and her nephew tried
            to stand on his head, as the only mode of expressing his satisfaction that school was over.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What have you been at today, biibchen?&rdquo; <u><sup>lm</sup></u> asked Mr. Bhaer, picking up the
            gymnast.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Me went to see little Mary.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And what did you there?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I kissed her,&rdquo; began Demi, with artless frankness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Prut! Thou beginnest early. What did the little Mary say to that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing
            to confess the young sinner, who stood upon his knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it. Don&rsquo;t little boys like little girls?&rdquo;
            asked Demi, with his mouth full, and an air of bland satisfaction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You precocious chick! Who put that into your head?&rdquo; said Jo, enjoying the innocent revelation as
            much as the Professor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t in mine head, it&rsquo;s in mine mouf,&rdquo; answered literal Demi, putting out
            his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking she alluded to confectionery, not ideas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Thou shouldst save some for the little friend: sweets to the sweet, mannling.&rdquo; And Mr. Bhaer
            offered Jo some, with a look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. Demi
            also saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessly inquired&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do great boys like great girls, too, &lsquo;Fessor?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t tell a lie,&rdquo; so he gave the somewhat vague reply
            that he believed they did sometimes, in a tone that made Mr. March put down his clothesbrush, glance at
            Jo&rsquo;s retiring face, and then sink into his chair, looking as if the &ldquo;precocious chick&rdquo; had
            put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an hour afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of
            his little body with a tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she followed up this
            novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems
            over which Demi puzzled his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>46</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Under the Umbrella</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets, as they set their house in order and
            planned a blissful future, Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort, along muddy roads
            and sodden fields.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don&rsquo;t know why I should give it up, just because I
            often happen to meet the Professor on his way out,&rdquo; said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters;
            for, though there were two paths to Meg&rsquo;s whichever one she took she was sure to meet him, either
            going or returning. He was always walking rapidly, and never seemed to see her till quite close, when he
            would look as if his shortsighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment. Then,
            if she was going to Meg&lsquo;s, he always had something for the babies; if her face was turned homeward, he
            had merely strolled down to see the river, and was just returning, unless they were tired of his frequent
            calls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, and invite him in? If she was tired of his
            visits, she concealed her weariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee for
            supper, &ldquo;as Friedrich&mdash;I mean Mr. Bhaer&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t like tea.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was going on, yet everyone tried to look as if they
            were stone-blind to the changes in Jo&rsquo;s face. They never asked why she sang about her work, did up her
            hair three times a day, and got so blooming with her evening exercise; and no one seemed to have the
            slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer, while talking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter
            lessons in love.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo couldn&rsquo;t even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but sternly tried to quench her feelings; and,
            failing to do so, led a somewhat agitated life. She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for
            surrendering, after her many and vehement declarations of independence. Laurie was her especial dread; but,
            thanks to the new manager, he behaved with praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer &ldquo;a capital
            old fellow&rdquo; in public, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo&rsquo;s improved appearance, or
            expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor&rsquo;s hat on the Marches&rsquo; hall table nearly
            every evening. But he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of
            plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with loverlike regularity; then he stayed away for three whole
            days, and made no sign, a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to become pensive, at
            first, and then&mdash;alas for romance!&mdash;very cross.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. It&rsquo;s nothing to me, of course; but
            I should think he would have come and bid us good-by like a gentleman,&rdquo; she said to herself, with a
            despairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for the customary walk one dull afternoon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take the little umbrella, dear; it looks like rain,&rdquo; said her mother,
            observing that she had on her new bonnet, but not alluding to the fact.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Marmee, do you want anything in town? I&rsquo;ve got to run in and get some paper,&rdquo;
            returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I want some twilled silesia,<u><sup>ln</sup></u> a paper of number nine needles, and two yards of
            narrow lavender ribbon. Have you got your thick boots on, and something warm under your cloak?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; answered Jo absently.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite long to see the dear man,&rdquo; added
            Mrs. March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo heard that, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother, and walk rapidly away, thinking with a glow of
            gratitude, in spite of her heartache, &ldquo;How good she is to me! What do girls do who haven&rsquo;t any
            mothers to help them through their troubles?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The dry-goods stores were not down among the countinghouses,<u><sup>lo</sup></u> banks, and wholesale
            warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate; but Jo found herself in that part of the city before she did
            a single errand, loitering along as if waiting for someone, examining engineering instruments in one window
            and samples of wool in another, with most unfeminine interest; tumbling over barrels, being half-smothered
            by descending bales, and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as if they wondered &ldquo;how the
            deuce she got there.&rdquo; A drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined
            ribbons; for the drops continued to fall, and, being a woman as well as a lover, she felt that, though it
            was too late to save her heart, she might her bonnet. Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had
            forgotten to take in her hurry to be off, but regret was unavailing, and nothing could be done but borrow
            one or submit to a drenching. She looked up at the lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked
            with black, forward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering look behind, at a certain grimy
            warehouse, with &ldquo;Hoffmann, Swartz, &amp; Co.&rdquo; over the door, and said to herself, with a sternly
            reproachful air&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It serves me right! What business had I to put on all my best things and come philandering down here,
            hoping to see the Professor? Jo, I&rsquo;m ashamed of you! No, you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella,
            or find out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge away, and do your errands in the rain; and if
            you catch your death and ruin your bonnet, it&rsquo;s no more than you deserve. Now then!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing
            truck, and precipitated herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, &ldquo;I beg pardon,
            ma&lsquo;am,&rdquo; and looked mortally offended. Somewhat daunted, Jo righted herself, spread her
            handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and, putting temptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing
            dampness about the ankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead. The fact that a somewhat dilapidated
            blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention, and looking up, she saw
            Mr. Bhaer looking down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many horse noses, and so fast through
            much mud. What do you down here, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shopping.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern
            on the other, but he only said politely, &ldquo;You haf no umbrella. May I go also, and take for you the
            bundles?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo&rsquo;s cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought of her, but she didn&rsquo;t
            care, for in a minute she found herself walking away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun
            had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again, and that one thoroughly
            happy woman was paddling through the wet that day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We thought you had gone,&rdquo; said Jo hastily, for she knew he was looking at her. Her bonnet
            wasn&rsquo;t big enough to hide her face, and she feared he might</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind to me?&rdquo;
            he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered
            heartily&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t; I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we rather missed you&mdash;Father
            and Mother especially.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always glad to see you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool, and the frosty little monosyllable at
            the end seemed to chill the Professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I thank you, and come one time more before I go.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You are going, then?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I haf no longer any business here, it is done.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Successfully, I hope?&rdquo; said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of
            his.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make my bread and gif my
            Jiinglings<u><sup>lp</sup></u> much help.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell me, please! I like to know all about
            the&mdash;the boys,&rdquo; said Jo eagerly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;That is so kind, I gladly tell you. My friends find for me a place in a college, where I teach as at
            home, and earn enough to make the way smooth for Franz and Emil. For this I should be grateful, should I
            not?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Indeed you should. How splendid it will be to have you doing what you like, and be able to see you
            often, and the boys!&rdquo; cried Jo, clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not
            help betraying.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah! But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at the West.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So far away!&rdquo; And Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if it didn&rsquo;t matter now what became
            of her clothes or herself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned to read women yet. He flattered himself that
            he knew Jo pretty well, and was, therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and manner,
            which she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course
            of half an hour. When she met him she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help suspecting that she
            had come for that express purpose. When he offered her his arm, she took it with a look that filled him with
            delight; but when he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply that despair fell upon
            him. On learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands: was the joy all for the boys? Then, on
            hearing his destination, she said, &ldquo;So far away!&rdquo; in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a
            pinnacle of hope; but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing, like one entirely absorbed in
            the matter&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the place for my errands. Will you come in? It won&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and particularly wished to impress her escort with
            the neatness and dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. But, owing to the flutter she was
            in, everything went amiss; she upset the tray of needles, forgot the silesia was to be &ldquo;twilled&rdquo;
            till it was cut off, gave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon
            at the calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own
            bewilderment seemed to subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions women, like dreams, go by
            contraries.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful aspect, and splashed through the
            puddles as if he rather enjoyed it on the whole.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Should we not do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and haf a farewell feast tonight if I
            go for my last call at your so pleasant home?&rdquo; he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit and
            flowers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What will we buy?&rdquo; said Jo, ignoring the latter part of his speech, and sniffing the mingled
            odors with an affectation of delight as they went in.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;May they haf oranges and figs?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;They eat them when they can get them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Do you care for nuts?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Like a squirrel.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hamburg grapes; yes, we shall surely drink to the Fatherland in those?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn&rsquo;t buy a frail of dates, a cask of
            raisins, and a bag of almonds, and done with it? Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own,
            and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy daisies, and a pretty jar of
            honey, to be regarded in the light of a demijohn.<u><sup>lq</sup></u> Then, distorting his pockets with the
            knobby bundles, and giving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they traveled on again.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you,&rdquo; began the Professor, after a moist promenade of
            half a block.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; And Jo&rsquo;s heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time remains to me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; And Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden squeeze she gave it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go alone. Will you kindly gif me a
            word of taste and help?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; And Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if
            she had stepped into a refrigerator.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Perhaps also a shawl for Tina&rsquo;s mother, she is so poor and sick, and the husband is such a care.
            Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a friendly thing to take the little mother.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer. I&rsquo;m going very fast and he&rsquo;s getting dearer
            every minute,&rdquo; added Jo to herself, then with a mental shake she entered into the business with an
            energy which was pleasant to behold.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and then ordered out the shawls. The
            clerk, being a married man, condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be shopping for
            their family.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Your lady may prefer this; it&rsquo;s a superior article, a most desirable color, quite chaste and
            genteel,&rdquo; he said, shaking out a comfortable gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo&rsquo;s shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?&rdquo; she asked, turning her back to him, and feeling deeply grateful
            for the chance of hiding her face.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Excellently well, we will haf it,&rdquo; answered the Professor, smiling to himself as he paid for it,
            while Jo continued to rummage the counters like a</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>confirmed bargain-hunter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now shall we go home?&rdquo; he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s late, and I&rsquo;m so tired.&rdquo; Jo&rsquo;s voice was more pathetic than she knew;
            for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out, the world grew muddy and miserable again,
            and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and that her heart was colder
            than the former, fuller of pain than the latter. Mr. Bhaer was going away, he only cared for her as a
            friend, it was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better. With this idea in her head, she hailed
            an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly
            damaged.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;This is not our omniboos,&rdquo; said the Professor, waving the loaded vehicle away, and stopping to
            pick up the poor little flowers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, I didn&rsquo;t see the name distinctly. Never mind, I can walk. I&rsquo;m used to
            plodding in the mud,&rdquo; returned Jo, winking hard, because she would have died rather than openly wipe
            her eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her head away; the sight seemed to touch him very
            much, for, suddenly stooping down, he asked in a tone that meant a great deal, &ldquo;Heart&rsquo;s dearest,
            why do you cry?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she wasn&rsquo;t crying, had a cold in
            her head, or told any other feminine fib proper to the occasion; instead of which that undignified creature
            answered, with an irrepressible sob, &ldquo;Because you are going away.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ach, mein Gott, that is so good!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bhaer, managing to clasp his hands in spite of the
            umbrella and the bundles. &ldquo;Jo, I haf nothing but much love to gif you; I came to see if you could care
            for it, and I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend. Am I? Can you make a little place
            in your heart for old Fritz?&rdquo; he added, all in one breath.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Jo; and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both hands over his arm, and
            looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside
            him, even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he carried it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he had desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go
            down upon his knees, on account of the mud; neither could he offer Jo his hand, except figuratively, for
            both were full; much less could he indulge in tender demonstrations in the open street, though he was near
            it; so the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her, with an expression which
            glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that
            sparkled on his beard. If he had not loved Jo very much, I don&rsquo;t think he could have done it then, for
            she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle,
            and her bonnet a ruin. Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living, and she found
            him more &ldquo;Jove-like&rdquo; than ever, though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills
            trickling thence upon his shoulders (for he held the umbrella all over Jo), and every finger of his gloves
            needed mending.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they entirely forgot to hail a bus, and
            strolled leisurely along, oblivious of deepening dusk and fog. Little they cared what anybody thought, for
            they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life, the magical moment which bestows
            youth on the old, beauty on the plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven. The
            Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of
            bliss; while Jo trudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been there, and wondering how she
            ever could have chosen any other lot. Of course, she was the first to speak&mdash;intelligibly, I mean, for
            the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; were not of a coherent or
            reportable character.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Friedrich, why didn&rsquo;t you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died!&rdquo; cried the Professor,
            pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful delight. &ldquo;I always call you so to myself&mdash;I
            forgot; but I won&lsquo;t, unless you like it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Like it? It is more sweet to me than I can tell. Say &lsquo;thou,&rsquo; also, and I shall say your
            language is almost as beautiful as mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;thou&rsquo; a little
            sentimental?&rdquo; asked Jo, privately thinking it a lovely monosyllable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and keep ourselves young mit it. Your
            English &lsquo;you&rsquo; is so cold, say &lsquo;thou,&rsquo; heart&rsquo;s dearest, it means so much to
            me,&rdquo; pleaded Mr. Bhaer, more like a romantic student than a grave professor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Well, then, why didn&rsquo;t thou tell me all this sooner?&rdquo; asked Jo bashfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly will, because thou must take care of it
            hereafter. See, then, my Jo&mdash;ah, the dear, funny little name!&mdash;I had a wish to tell something the
            day I said good-by in New York, but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to thee, and so I spoke not.
            Wouldst thou have said &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; then, if I had spoken?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m afraid not, for I didn&rsquo;t have any heart just then.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Prut! That I do not believe. It was asleep till the fairy prince came through the wood, and waked it
            up. Ah, well, &lsquo;Die erste Liebe ist die beste,&rsquo;<u><sup>lr</sup></u> but that I should not
            expect.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, the first love is the best, so be contented, for I never had another. Teddy was only a boy, and
            soon got over his little fancy,&rdquo; said Jo, anxious to correct the Professor&rsquo;s mistake.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Good! Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest me all. I haf waited so long, I am grown
            selfish, as thou wilt find, Professorin.&rdquo; &ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; cried Jo, delighted with her new
            name. &ldquo;Now tell me what brought you, at last, just when I most wanted you?&rdquo; &ldquo;This.&rdquo;
            And Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his waistcoat pocket.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of her own contributions to a paper that paid for
            poetry, which accounted for her sending it an occasional attempt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;How could that bring you?&rdquo; she asked, wondering what he meant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I found it by chance; I knew it by the names and the initials, and in it there was one little verse
            that seemed to call me. Read and find him; I will see that you go not in the wet.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo obeyed, and hastily skimmed through the lines which she had christened&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IN THE GARRET</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Four little chests all in a row,</p>
        <p>Dim with dust, and worn by time,</p>
        <p>All fashioned and filled, long ago,</p>
        <p>By children now in their prime.</p>
        <p>Four little keys hung side by side,</p>
        <p>With faded ribbons, brave and gay</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When fastened there, with childish pride,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Long ago, on a rainy day.</p>
        <p>Four little names, one on each lid,</p>
        <p>Carved out by a boyish hand,</p>
        <p>And underneath there lieth hid</p>
        <p>Histories of the happy band</p>
        <p>Once playing here, and pausing oft</p>
        <p>To hear the sweet refrain,</p>
        <p>That came and went on the roof aloft,</p>
        <p>In the falling summer rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Meg&rdquo; on the first lid, smooth and fair.</p>
        <p>I look in with loving eyes,</p>
        <p>For folded here, with well-known care,</p>
        <p>A goodly gathering lies,</p>
        <p>The record of a peaceful life&mdash;</p>
        <p>Gifts to gentle child and girl,</p>
        <p>A bridal gown, lines to a wife,</p>
        <p>A tiny shoe, a baby curl.</p>
        <p>No toys in this first chest remain,</p>
        <p>For all are carried away,</p>
        <p>In their old age, to join again</p>
        <p>In another small Meg&rsquo;s play.</p>
        <p>Ah, happy mother! well I know</p>
        <p>You hear, like a sweet refrain,</p>
        <p>Lullabies ever soft and low</p>
        <p>In the falling summer rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo&rdquo; on the next lid, scratched and worn,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And within a motley store</p>
        <p>Of headless dolls, of schoolbooks torn,</p>
        <p>Birds and beasts that speak no more;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Spoils brought home from the fairy ground</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Only trod by youthful feet,</p>
        <p>Dreams of a future never found,</p>
        <p>Memories of a past still sweet;</p>
        <p>Half-writ poems, stories wild,</p>
        <p>April letters, warm and cold,</p>
        <p>Diaries of a wilful child,</p>
        <p>Hints of a woman early old;</p>
        <p>A woman in a lonely home,</p>
        <p>Hearing, like a sad refrain&mdash;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Be worthy love, and love will come,&rdquo;</p>
        <p>In the falling summer rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My Beth! the dust is always swept</p>
        <p>From the lid that bears your name,</p>
        <p>As if by loving eyes that wept,</p>
        <p>By careful hands that often came.</p>
        <p>Death canonized for us one saint,</p>
        <p>Ever less human than divine,</p>
        <p>And still we lay, with tender plaint,</p>
        <p>Relics in this household shrine&mdash;</p>
        <p>The silver bell, so seldom rung,</p>
        <p>The little cap which last she wore,</p>
        <p>The fair, dead Catherine that hung</p>
        <p>By angels borne above her door;</p>
        <p>The songs she sang, without lament,</p>
        <p>In her prison-house of pain,</p>
        <p>Forever are they sweetly blent</p>
        <p>With the falling summer rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Upon the last lid&rsquo;s polished field&mdash;</p>
        <p>Legend now both fair and true</p>
        <p>A gallant knight bears on his shield,</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Amy,&rdquo; in letters gold and blue.</p>
        <p>Within lie snoods that bound her hair,</p>
        <p>Slippers that have danced their last,</p>
        <p>Faded flowers laid by with care,</p>
        <p>Fans whose airy toils are past;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gay valentines, all ardent flames,</p>
        <p>Trifles that have borne their part</p>
        <p>In girlish hopes and fears and shames,</p>
        <p>The record of a maiden heart</p>
        <p>Now learning fairer, truer spells,</p>
        <p>Hearing, like a blithe refrain,</p>
        <p>The silver sound of bridal bells</p>
        <p>In the falling summer rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Four little chests all in a row,</p>
        <p>Dim with dust, and worn by time,</p>
        <p>Four women, taught by weal and woe</p>
        <p>To love and labor in their prime.</p>
        <p>Four sisters, parted for an hour,</p>
        <p>None lost, one only gone before,</p>
        <p>Made by love&rsquo;s immortal power,</p>
        <p>Nearest and dearest evermore.</p>
        <p>Oh, when these hidden stores of ours</p>
        <p>Lie open to the Father&rsquo;s sight,</p>
        <p>May they be rich in golden hours,</p>
        <p>Deeds that show fairer for the light,</p>
        <p>Lives whose brave music long shall ring,</p>
        <p>Like a spirit-stirring strain,</p>
        <p>Souls that shall gladly soar and sing</p>
        <p>In the long sunshine after rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>J.M.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day when I was very lonely, and had a
            good cry on a rag bag. I never thought it would go where it could tell tales,&rdquo; said Jo, tearing up the
            verses the Professor had treasured so long.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Let it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I read all the brown book in which
            she keeps her little secrets,&rdquo; said Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the
            wind. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he added earnestly, &ldquo;I read that, and I think to myself, She has a sorrow,
            she is lonely, she would find comfort in true love. I haf a heart full, full for her; shall I not go and
            say, &lsquo;If this is not too poor a thing to gif for what I shall hope to receive, take it in Gott&rsquo;s
            name?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one precious thing I needed,&rdquo;
            whispered Jo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was your welcome to me. But soon I began to
            hope, and then I said, &lsquo;I will haf her if I die for it,&rsquo; and so I will!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bhaer,
            with a defiant nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he was to surmount or
            valiantly knock down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight, though he did not come prancing on a
            charger in gorgeous array.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;What made you stay away so long?&rdquo; she asked presently, finding it so pleasant to ask
            confidential questions and get delightful answers that she could not keep silent.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you from that so happy home until I could haf
            a prospect of one to give you, after much time, perhaps, and hard work. How could I ask you to gif up so
            much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are poor; I couldn&rsquo;t bear a rich husband,&rdquo; said Jo decidedly, adding,
            in a softer tone, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear poverty. I&rsquo;ve known it long enough to lose my dread and be
            happy working for those I love; and don&rsquo;t call yourself old&mdash;forty is the prime of life. I
            couldn&rsquo;t help loving you if you were seventy!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his handkerchief, if he could have got
            at it; as he couldn&lsquo;t, Jo wiped his eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she took away a bundle or
            two&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I&rsquo;m out of my sphere now, for woman&rsquo;s special
            mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing burdens. I&rsquo;m to carry my share, Friedrich, and help
            to earn the home. Make up your mind to that, or I&rsquo;ll never go,&rdquo; she added resolutely, as he
            tried to reclaim his load.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We shall see. Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I must go away and do my work alone. I must
            help my boys first, because, even for you, I may not break my word to Minna. Can you forgif that, and be
            happy while we hope and wait?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes all the rest easy to bear. I have my duty,
            also, and my work. I couldn&rsquo;t enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you, so there&rsquo;s no need
            of hurry or impatience. You can do your part out West, I can do mine here, and both be happy hoping for the
            best, and leaving the future to be as God wills.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Ah! Thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing to gif back but a full heart and these
            empty hands,&rdquo; cried the Professor, quite overcome.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo never, never would learn to be proper, for when he said that as they stood upon the steps, she just put
            both hands into his, whispering tenderly, &ldquo;Not empty now,&rdquo; and, stooping down, kissed her
            Friedrich under the umbrella. It was dreadful, but she would have done it if the flock of draggle-tailed
            sparrows on the hedge had been human beings, for she was very far gone indeed, and quite regardless of
            everything but her own happiness. Though it came in such a very simple guise, that was the crowning moment
            of both their lives, when, turning from the night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth
            and peace waiting to receive them, with a glad &ldquo;Welcome home!&rdquo; Jo led her lover in, and shut the
            door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>47</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harvest Time</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met occasionally, and wrote such
            voluminous letters that the rise in the price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said. The second year began
            rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March died suddenly. But when their first
            sorrow was over&mdash;for they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp tongue&mdash;they found they had
            cause for rejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts of joyful things possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for of course you intend to sell
            it,&rdquo; said Laurie, as they were all talking the matter over some weeks later.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No, I don&lsquo;t,&rdquo; was Jo&rsquo;s decided answer, as she petted the fat poodle, whom she had
            adopted, out of respect to his former mistress.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to live there?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;But, my dear girl, it&rsquo;s an immense house, and will take a power of money to keep it in order.
            The garden and orchard alone need two or three men, and farming isn&rsquo;t in Bhaer&rsquo;s line, I take
            it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll try his hand at it there, if I propose it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And you expect to live on the produce of the place? Well, that sounds paradisiacal, but you&rsquo;ll
            find it desperate hard work.&rdquo; &ldquo;The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one.&rdquo; And Jo
            laughed. &ldquo;Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma&lsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Boys. I want to open a school for little lads&mdash;a good, happy, homelike school, with me to take
            care of them and Fritz to teach them.&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a truly Joian plan for you! Isn&rsquo;t
            that just like her?&rdquo; cried Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised as he.
            &ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; said Mrs. March decidedly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a chance for trying the Socratic method
            of education on modern youth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;It will be an immense care for Jo,&rdquo; said Meg, stroking the head of her one all-absorbing son.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Jo can do it, and be happy in it. It&rsquo;s a splendid idea. Tell us all about it,&rdquo; cried Mr.
            Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers a hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d stand by me, sir. Amy does too&mdash;I see it in her eyes, though she prudently
            waits to turn it over in her mind before she speaks. Now, my dear people,&rdquo; continued Jo earnestly,
            &ldquo;just understand that this isn&rsquo;t a new idea of mine, but a long-cherished plan. Before my Fritz
            came, I used to think how, when I&rsquo;d made my fortune, and no one needed me at home, I&rsquo;d hire a
            big house, and pick up some poor, forlorn little lads who hadn&rsquo;t any mothers, and take care of them,
            and make life jolly for them before it was too late. I see so many going to ruin for want of help at the
            right minute, I love so to do anything for them, I seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their
            troubles, and, oh, I should so like to be a mother to them!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in her eyes, and went on in the old
            enthusiastic way, which they had not seen for a long while.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would like, and agreed to try it when we
            got rich. Bless his dear heart, he&rsquo;s been doing it all his life&mdash;helping poor boys, I mean, not
            getting rich; that he&rsquo;ll never be; money doesn&rsquo;t stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any.
            But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved me better than I ever deserved, I&rsquo;m rich, at least I
            feel so, and we can live at Plumfield perfectly well, if we have a flourishing school. It&rsquo;s just the
            place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture strong and plain. There&rsquo;s plenty of room for
            dozens inside, and splendid grounds outside. They could help in the garden and orchard: such work is
            healthy, isn&rsquo;t it, sir? Then Fritz can train and teach in his own way, and Father will help him. I can
            feed and nurse and pet and scold them, and Mother will be my stand-by. I&rsquo;ve always longed for lots of
            boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and revel in the little dears to my heart&rsquo;s
            content. Think what luxury&mdash;Plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off into a gale of merriment, and Mr.
            Laurence laughed till they thought he&rsquo;d have an apoplectic fit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything funny,&rdquo; she said gravely, when she could be heard. &ldquo;Nothing
            could be more natural or proper than for my Professor to open a school, and for me to prefer to reside on my
            own estate.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She is putting on airs already,&rdquo; said Laurie, who regarded the idea in the light of a capital
            joke. &ldquo;But may I inquire how you intend to support the establishment? If all the pupils are little
            ragamuffins, I&rsquo;m afraid your crop won&rsquo;t be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs. Bhaer.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t be a wet-blanket, Teddy. Of course I shall have rich pupils, also&mdash;perhaps begin
            with such altogether; then, when I&rsquo;ve got start, I can take a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish.
            Rich people&rsquo;s children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I&rsquo;ve seen unfortunate
            little creatures left to servants, or backward ones pushed forward, when it&rsquo;s real cruelty. Some are
            naughty through mismanagement or neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best have to get through
            the hobbledehoy<u><sup>ls</sup></u> age, and that&rsquo;s the very time they need most patience and
            kindness. People laugh at them, and hustle them about, try to keep them out of sight, and expect them to
            turn all at once from pretty children into fine young men. They don&rsquo;t complain much &mdash;plucky
            little souls&mdash;but they feel it. I&rsquo;ve been through something of it, and I know all about it.
            I&rsquo;ve a special interest in such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm, honest,
            well-meaning boys&rsquo; hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsy-turvy heads. I&rsquo;ve
            had experience, too, for haven&rsquo;t I brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll testify that you tried to do it,&rdquo; said Laurie with a grateful look.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve succeeded beyond my hopes; for here you are, a steady, sensible businessman, doing
            heaps of good with your money, and laying up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not
            merely a businessman: you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them yourself, and let others go halves, as
            you always did in the old times. I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone feels
            it, though you won&rsquo;t let them say so. Yes, and when I have my flock, I&rsquo;ll just point to you, and
            say, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s your model, my lads.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Poor Laurie didn&rsquo;t know where to look; for, man though he was, something of the old bashfulness came
            over him as this burst of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I say, Jo, that&rsquo;s rather too much,&rdquo; he began, just in his old boyish way. &ldquo;You have
            all done more for me than I can ever thank you for, except by doing my best not to disappoint you. You have
            rather cast me off lately, Jo, but I&rsquo;ve had the best of help, nevertheless; so, if I&rsquo;ve got on
            at all, you may thank these two for it.&rdquo; And he laid one hand gently on his grandfather&rsquo;s white
            head, the other on Amy&rsquo;s golden one, for the three were never far apart.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world!&rdquo; burst out Jo, who was
            in an unusually uplifted frame of mind just then. &ldquo;When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as
            happy as the three I know and love the best. If John and my Fritz were only here, it would be quite a little
            heaven on earth,&rdquo; she added more quietly. And that night when she went to her room after a blissful
            evening of family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of happiness that she could only calm it
            by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.</p>
        <p>It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen in an unusually rapid and delightful
            manner. Almost before she knew where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield. Then a
            family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished surprisingly, poor boys as well as
            rich; for Mr. Laurence was continually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the Bhaers to
            take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support. In this way the sly old gentleman
            got round proud Jo, and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes; but the wise Professor steered her safely
            into calmer waters, and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her
            &ldquo;wilderness of boys,&rdquo; and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented had she been there to
            see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys! There was a
            sort of poetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles
            round; and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots
            unreproved, and played cricket in the big field where the irritable &ldquo;cow with a crumpled
            horn&rdquo;<u><sup>lt</sup></u> used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed. It became a sort of
            boys&rsquo; paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be called the &ldquo;Bhaer-garten,&rdquo; as a
            compliment to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a fortune; but it was just what Jo
            intended it to be&mdash;&ldquo;a happy, homelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and
            kindness.&rdquo; Every room in the big house was soon full; every little plot in the garden soon had its
            owner; a regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed, for pet animals were allowed; and, three times a day,
            Jo smiled at her Fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy young faces,
            which all turned to her with affectionate eyes, confiding words, and grateful hearts, full of love for
            &rdquo;Mother Bhaer.&rdquo; She had boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not angels,
            by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and Professorin much trouble and anxiety. But her faith
            in the good spot which exists in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing little ragamuffin
            gave her patience, skill, and in time success, for no mortal boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer
            shining on him as benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times seven. Very precious
            to Jo was the friendship of the lads; their penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing; their droll or
            touching little confidences; their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans; even their misfortunes, for they
            only endeared them to her all the more. There were slow boys and bashful boys; feeble boys and riotous boys;
            boys that lisped and boys that stuttered; one or two lame ones; and a merry little
            quadroon,<u><sup>lu</sup></u> who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was welcome to the
            &ldquo;Bhaer-garten,&rdquo; though some people predicted that his admission would ruin the school.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much anxiety, and a perpetual racket. She
            enjoyed it heartily and found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world, for now
            she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers and admirers. As the years went on, two
            little lads of her own came to increase her happiness&mdash;Rob, named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a
            happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa&rsquo;s sunshiny temper as well as his
            mother&rsquo;s lively spirit. How they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their
            grandma and aunts, but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough nurses loved and served
            them well.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most delightful was the yearly apple-picking;
            for then the Marches, Laurences, Brookes, and Bhaers turned out in full force and made a day of it. Five
            years after Jo&rsquo;s wedding, one of these fruitful festivals occurred&mdash;a mellow October day, when
            the air was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in
            the veins. The old orchard wore its holiday attire: goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls;
            grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a feast; squirrels
            were busy with their small harvesting; birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane; and every
            tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake. Everybody was there;
            everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled down; everybody declared that there never had been such a
            perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it; and everyone gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the
            hour as freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the world.</p>
        <p>Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and Columella <u><sup>22</sup></u> to Mr.
            Laurence, while enjoying&mdash;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The gentle apple&rsquo;s winey juice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout Teutonic knight,<u><sup>lv</sup></u> with a
            pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed
            wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling. Laurie devoted himself to the little ones, rode his small
            daughter in a bushelbasket, took Daisy up among the birds&rsquo; nests, and kept adventurous Rob from
            breaking his neck. Mrs. March and Meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas,<u><sup>lw</sup></u>
            sorting the contributions that kept pouring in, while Amy with a beautiful motherly expression in her face
            sketched the various groups, and watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little crutch
            beside him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown pinned up, her hat anywhere but on her head,
            and her baby tucked under her arm, ready for any lively adventure which might turn up. Little Teddy bore a
            charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a
            tree by one lad, galloped off on the back of another, or supplied with sour russets<u><sup>lx</sup></u> by
            his indulgent papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies could digest anything, from pickled
            cabbage to buttons, nails, and their own small shoes. She knew that little Ted would turn up again in time,
            safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her
            babies tenderly.</p>
        <p>At four o&lsquo;clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while the apple-pickers rested and
            compared rents<u><sup>ly</sup></u> and bruises. Then Jo and Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set
            forth the supper on the grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day. The land
            literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for the lads were not required to sit at table, but
            allowed to partake of refreshment as they liked&mdash;freedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish
            soul. They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing
            experiment of drinking milk while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in
            the pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over the field, and apple turnovers roosted in the trees
            like a new style of bird. The little girls had a private tea party, and Ted roved among the edibles at his
            own sweet will.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first regular toast, which was always drunk at
            such times&mdash;&ldquo;Aunt March, God bless her!&rdquo; A toast heartily given by the good man, who never
            forgot how much he owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been taught to keep her memory green.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Now, Grandma&rsquo;s sixtieth birthday! Long life to her, with three times three!&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was given with a will, as you may well believe; and the cheering once begun, it was hard to stop it.
            Everybody&rsquo;s health was proposed, from Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the
            astonished guinea pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search of its young master. Demi, as the
            oldest grandchild, then presented the queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were
            transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow. Funny presents, some of them, but what would have been
            defects to other eyes were ornaments to Grandma&lsquo;s&mdash;for the children&rsquo;s gifts were all their
            own. Every stitch Daisy&rsquo;s patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better
            than embroidery to Mrs. March; Demi&rsquo;s shoebox was a miracle of mechanical skill, though the cover
            wouldn&rsquo;t shut; Rob&rsquo;s footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was very
            soothing; and no page of the costly book Amy&rsquo;s child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared,
            in tipsy capitals, the words&mdash;&ldquo;To dear Grandma, from her little Beth.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During this ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared; and, when Mrs. March had tried to thank her
            children, and broken down, while Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to sing.
            Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and from tree to tree echoed the music of the
            unseen choir, as the boys sang with all their hearts the little song Jo had written, Laurie set to music,
            and the Professor trained his lads to give with the best effect. This was something altogether new, and it
            proved a grand success; for Mrs. March couldn&rsquo;t get over her surprise, and insisted on shaking hands
            with every one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz and Emil to the little quadroon, who had the
            sweetest voice of all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival
            tree.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever ought to call myself &lsquo;Unlucky Jo&rsquo; again, when my greatest wish
            has been so beautifully gratified,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bhaer, taking Teddy&rsquo;s little fist out of the milk
            pitcher, in which he was rapturously churning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long ago. Do you remember our castles
            in the air?&rdquo; asked Amy, smiling as she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Dear fellows! It does my heart good to see them forget business and frolic for a day,&rdquo; answered
            Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind. &ldquo;Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then seems
            selfish, lonely, and cold to me now. I haven&rsquo;t given up the hope that I may write a good book yet, but
            I can wait, and I&rsquo;m sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as
            these.&rdquo; And Jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the
            Professor&rsquo;s arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one of the conversations which
            both enjoyed so much, and then to her mother, sitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in
            her lap and at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow old to them.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My castle was the most nearly realized of all. I asked for splendid things, to be sure, but in my
            heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I had a little home, and John, and some dear children like these.
            I&rsquo;ve got them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world.&rdquo; And Meg laid her hand on
            her tall boy&rsquo;s head, with a face full of tender and devout content.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter it, though, like Jo, I
            don&rsquo;t relinquish all my artistic hopes, or confine myself to helping others fulfil their dreams of
            beauty. I&rsquo;ve begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing I&rsquo;ve ever
            done. I think so myself, and mean to do it in marble, so that, whatever happens, I may at least keep the
            image of my little angel.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping child in her arms, for her one
            well-beloved daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over
            Amy&rsquo;s sunshine. This cross was doing much for both father and mother, for one love and sorrow bound
            them closely together. Amy&rsquo;s nature was growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender; Laurie was growing
            more serious, strong, and firm; and both were learning that beauty, youth, good fortune, even love itself,
            cannot keep care and pain, loss and sorrow, from the most blessed for&mdash;</p>
        <p>Into each life some rain must fall,</p>
        <p>Some days must be dark and sad and dreary.<u><sup>lz</sup></u></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear. Don&rsquo;t despond, but hope and keep happy,&rdquo;
            said Mrs. March, as tenderhearted Daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little
            cousin&rsquo;s pale one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie to take more than half of every
            burden,&rdquo; replied Amy warmly. &ldquo;He never lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with
            me, so devoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always that I can&rsquo;t love him enough. So, in
            spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg, &lsquo;Thank God, I&rsquo;m a happy woman.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for me to say it, for everyone can see that I&rsquo;m far happier than I
            deserve,&rdquo; added Jo, glancing from her good husband to her chubby children, tumbling on the grass
            beside her. &ldquo;Fritz is getting gray and stout; I&rsquo;m growing as thin as a shadow, and am thirty; we
            never shall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night, for that incorrigible Tommy Bangs will smoke
            sweet-fern cigars under the bedclothes, though he&rsquo;s set himself afire three times already. But in
            spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of, and never was so jolly in my life. Excuse
            the remark, but living among boys, I can&rsquo;t help using their expressions now and then.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one,&rdquo; began Mrs. March, frightening away a big
            black cricket that was staring Teddy out of countenance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Not half so good as yours, Mother. Here it is, and we never can thank you enough for the patient
            sowing and reaping you have done,&rdquo; cried Jo with the loving impetuosity which she never could outgrow.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year,&rdquo; said Amy softly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;A large sheaf, but I know there&rsquo;s room in your heart for it, Marmee dear,&rdquo; added
            Meg&rsquo;s tender voice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms, as if to gather children and grandchildren
            to herself, and say, with face and voice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility-</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this!&rdquo;

        <p>ENDNOTES</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><u>1</u> (p. 3) &ldquo;Go then, my little Book, and show to all ....&rdquo; JOHN BUNYAN: Throughout Little
            Women, Alcott makes much use of English writer John Bunyan&rsquo;s</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>seventeenth-century religious allegory The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress, from This World to That Which Is to
            Come. This epigraph is recast from part two (1684) of this moral-instruction classic, which Alcott absorbed
            as a child. Bunyan&rsquo;s text narrates the journey of a character named Christian through many perilous
            adventures on his way to the Celestial City, or Heaven. During his journey, Christian encounters many
            evocatively named people and beings who try to help or to hinder him, including Faithful, Hopeful, and the
            Giant Despair. The book preaches for the bearing of life&rsquo;s burdens and for remaining resistant to
            temptation. Many of the chapter titles in Little Women refer to events and locations in The Pilgrim&rsquo;s
            Progress&mdash;&ldquo;Beth Finds the Palace Beautiful,&rdquo; &ldquo;Amy&rsquo;s Valley of
            Humiliation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jo Meets Apollyon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Meg Goes to Vanity Fair,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
            Valley of the Shadow,&rdquo; and so on&mdash;as each of the March daughters takes on one of
            Christian&rsquo;s temptations particular to her temperament and personal failings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><u>2</u> (p. 18) &ldquo;Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress when you were little
            things?&rdquo;: In the discussion that follows Mrs. March&rsquo;s question, references to The
            Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress (see endnote 1) include: the City of Destruction, the evil birthplace of Christian
            and the starting point of his journey to the Celestial City (Heaven); Apollyon, the hideous fiend who
            attacks Christian in the Valley of Humiliation; the Slough of Despond, a treacherous bog in which Christian
            is trapped; and the roll of directions, instructions for Christian&rsquo;s journey.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><u>3</u> (p. 72) the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes: Amy&rsquo;s scorn for the Irish
            children, although Alcott doesn&rsquo;t go into it at length here, expresses the author&rsquo;s own
            prejudices against this ethnic group; the Irish population had been burgeoning in the United States since
            the Great Famine in Ireland (1845-1850) and its consequent mass emigration. Even though Alcott and her
            mother, at one time a social worker in Boston, made a point of defending and accepting the humanity of other
            persecuted groups of the time&mdash;such as German-speaking immigrants (represented by the Hummels in this
            book) and African Americans (see Jo&rsquo;s eagerness at the end of Little Women to include a boy of mixed
            race in her school)&mdash;the Alcotts dismissed the Irish as being lazy, dirty, and unwilling to help
            themselves in order to improve their situation.</p>

                Fruitlands, a utopian vegetarian and shared-work community cofounded by Alcott&rsquo;s father in the
                rural town of Harvard, Massachusetts, in 1843, when Louisa was ten years old. Alcott&rsquo;s family
                resided there for the duration of the community&rsquo;s eight-month existence, suffering much
                deprivation and hardship, particularly toward the end.</li>

            nineteenth century. Players use mallets to send wooden balls through hoops, called wickets, that are
            arranged on the lawn to form a course. Croquet terms used here include: stroke, a swing at the ball with a
            mallet; and stake, a marker at the end of the course.</p>

            jib, a triangular sail forward of the mast; reef the tops&rsquo;l halliards means to lower the topsail with
            ropes, or halyards; helm hard alee means turn the ship to the leeward side&mdash;that is, away from the
            wind&mdash;in order to tack, or bring the bow through the wind; a schooner is a two-masted vessel; lee
            scuppers are drain holes on a ship&rsquo;s leeward side; the Bosun&rsquo;s mate is the assistant to the
            boatswain, the officer responsible for maintaining the ship&rsquo;s hull; take a bight of the flying-jib
            sheet is an order to slacken the rope that regulates the angle of the jib sail; start this villain means to
            start someone walking the plank; tars is a slang word for sailors; to scuttle a ship is to make holes in its
            bottom in order to sink it; all sail set means the sails are raised.</p>

            mere six months after publication of part one, as a response to the first March volume&rsquo;s phenomenal
            overnight success. Readers had begged Alcott for information about their beloved girls&rsquo; future,
            especially how well and to whom they were married. Alcott wrote this sequel very quickly (in two
            months&rsquo; time); although she catered to popular taste by consenting to marry off her heroines, she
            refused to partner them in accordance with her audience&rsquo;s expected, hoped-for conclusions.</p>

            a Dutch painter known for his mastery of light and shadow. Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) was a Flemish
            painter known for his voluptuous female figures. Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851) was an
            influential, groundbreaking English landscape painter famous for his brilliant use of color and abstract,
            dreamlike effects.</p>

            Professors Sands is discoursing on ancient Egypt: Giovanni Battista Belzoni (1778-1823) was an Italian
            explorer and archaeologist of ancient Egyptian antiquities. Cheops, or Khufu (twenty-sixth century B.C.),
            was a king of Egypt who erected the Great Pyramid at Giza. Scarabei, ancient Egyptian beetle sculptures,
            were symbols of resurrection. Hieroglyphics are characters used in a system of pictorial writing employed in

            the sketches are now displayed in London&rsquo;s Victoria and Albert Museum. Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830)
            was an English court painter who helped found London&rsquo;s National Gallery. Sir Joshua Reynolds
            (1723-1792) was a fashionable English portrait painter and first president of the Royal Academy. William
            Hogarth (1697-1764) was an English satirical painter and an engraver. (See note 8, above, for information on

        <p>&mdash;Louisa May Alcott, from her Journal</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Sequels</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Louisa May Alcott wrote for money, to &ldquo;take Fate by the throat and shake a living out of her.&rdquo;
            With the overwhelming success of Little Women, she became solvent enough to repay her family&rsquo;s
            accumulated debt, while combining her twin passions: her love of words and her talent for teaching children.
            Alcott cared deeply about the rearing of children, about high standards and role models, about morals and a
            robust work ethic. She deplored the rough, ill-grammared boys of Twain&rsquo;s Adventures of Huckleberry
            Finn: &ldquo;If Mr. Clemens cannot think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses, he had
            best stop writing for them.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the wake of Little Women&rsquo;s popularity, Alcott furthered her agenda of writing high-minded
            children&rsquo;s literature by publishing several more episodes of Jo March&rsquo;s clan. Little Men: Life
            at Plumfield with Jo&rsquo;s Boys (1871) was the first sequel. The book opens with a raggedy boy named Nat
            arriving at Plumfield to discover Alcott&rsquo;s characteristic atmosphere of education and recreation:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The house seemed swarming with boys, who were beguiling the rainy twilight with all sorts of amusements.
            There were boys everywhere, &ldquo;up-stairs and down-stairs and in the lady&rsquo;s chamber,&rdquo;
            apparently, for various open doors showed pleasant groups of big boys, little boys, and middle-sized boys in
            all stages of evening relaxation, not to say effervescence. Two large rooms on the right were evidently
            schoolrooms, for desks, maps, blackboards, and books were scattered about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Little Men was followed by Aunt Jo&rsquo;s Scrap Bag, published in six volumes between 1872 and 1882. The
            saga of Jo&rsquo;s progeny continued with Jo&rsquo;s Boys, and How They Turned Out (1886). Jo&rsquo;s Boys
            chronicles the boys&rsquo; lives as they become men and offers a glimpse into the sagac ity of Mrs. Jo and
            Mrs. Meg as they age gracefully: &ldquo;Now we are expected to be as wise as men who have had generations of
            all the help there is, and we scarcely anything.&rdquo; Alcott&rsquo;s posthumously published Comic
            Tragedies Written by &ldquo;Jo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Meg&rdquo; and Acted by the Little Women (1893), a lively
            collection of plays, furthered her mythology.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Film</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of the various attempts to bring Alcott&rsquo;s Little Women to the silver screen, two stand out as
            exemplary: George Cukor&rsquo;s 1933 version and Gillian Armstrong&rsquo;s 1994 adaptation. Cukor, the
            legendary film-maker who later made David Copperfield (1935) and My Fair Lady (1964), blends high production
            values and the nascent technology of sound to re-create Alcott&rsquo;s Civil War&mdash;era Massachusetts.
            Twenty-six-year-old Katharine Hepburn stars as the fiercely determined Jo; the film is the second of ten
            collaborations between Cukor and Hepburn, including the masterpiece The Philadelphia Story (1940). Little
            Women features a crisp script by Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Cukor&rsquo;s film is unabashedly sentimental, indulging in scenes of the turbulently emotional March sisters
            consoling each other in the parlor, that sanctuary from the war that threatens to keep their father away for
            good. The lively sorority of Jo, Meg (Frances Dee), Amy (Joan Bennett), and Beth (Jean Parker) reveals
            itself in homegrown plays, in which Hepburn, playing multiple roles as well as her sisters&rsquo; acting
            coach, dons a mustachio and a blonde wig by turns. Jo&rsquo;s girlish enthusiasm is sorely tested in her
            return to take care of Beth in the film&rsquo;s most moving sequence. Hepburn&rsquo;s chirpy, headstrong,
            and innocent performance captures the essence of Jo so completely that many critics have branded
            Cukor&rsquo;s the definitive version of Little Women. In addition to Mason and Heerman&rsquo;s Oscar-winning
            adaptation, Little Women was nominated for Outstanding Production (Best Picture) and Best Direction. Cukor
            later refused to take over the direction of the 1949 film of Little Women, starring Elizabeth Taylor and
            Janet Leigh.</p>
        <p>Gillian Armstrong&rsquo;s 1994 film was lauded as a successful effort to subtly renovate a classic into a
            germane story for modern audiences. While nothing can keep the characters from occasional ventures into
            sainthood, Armstrong valiantly downplays the story&rsquo;s more saccharine elements; in bringing
            Alcott&rsquo;s feminist sensibility to the fore, Armstrong nicely balances the compulsory old-fashioned
            conduct of the characters. The film features autumnal New England scenery and the formidable talent of a
            large ensemble cast: Winona Ryder as Jo; Susan Sarandon as Marmee, the flawless mother; Kirsten Dunst, who
            almost steals the show as the young Amy; Claire Danes as Beth; Eric Stoltz as John Brooke; Gabriel Byrne as
            Professor Bhaer; and a cavalcade of others. Winona Ryder&rsquo;s performance, Thomas Newman&rsquo;s score,
            and Colleen Atwood&rsquo;s costumes were all nominated for Academy Awards.</p>

        <p>Mr. N. wants a girls&rsquo; story, and I begin &lsquo;Little Women.&rsquo; Marmee (mother), Anna and May
            approve my plan, so I plod away, though I don&rsquo;t enjoy this sort of thing. Never liked girls or knew
            many, excepting sisters; our queer ways and experiences may prove interesting, though I doubt it.</p>

        <p>THE NATION</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Miss Alcott&rsquo;s new juvenile is an agreeable little story, which is not only very well adapted to the
            readers for whom it is especially intended, but may also be read with pleasure by older people. The girls
            depicted all belong to healthy types, and are drawn with a certain cleverness, although there is in the book
            a lack of what painters call atmosphere&mdash;things and people being painted too much in &ldquo;local
            colors,&rdquo; and remaining, under all circumstances, somewhat too persistently themselves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&mdash;from a review of Little Women (October 22, 1868)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>HENRY JAMES</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is sometimes affirmed by the observant foreigner, on visiting these shores, and indeed by the venturesome
            native, when experience has given him the power of invidious comparison, that American children are without
            a certain charm usually possessed by the youngsters of the Old World. The little girls are apt to be pert
            and shrill, the little boys to be aggressive and knowing; both the girls and boys are accused of lacking, or
            of having lost, the sweet, shy bloom of ideal infancy. If this is so, the philosophic mind desires to know
            the reason of it, and when in the course of its enquiry the philosophic mind encounters the tales of Miss
            Alcott, we think it will feel a momentary impulse to cry Eureka! Miss Alcott is the novelist of
            children&mdash;the Thackeray, the Trollope, of the nursery and the school-room. She deals with the social
            questions of the child-world, and, like Thackeray and Trollope, she is a satirist. She is extremely clever,
            and, we believe, vastly popular with infant readers.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The career of Miss Alcott has not only given pleasure to many readers, and real benefit to not a few, but it
            has afforded an example of what may be accomplished by talent and industry in the way of worldly success,
            and this of rather a high kind. She fulfilled that which is to-day the dearest dream of so many young women.
            Earning her living first by domestic service, she soon passed beyond that; by her own unaided pen she lifted
            an exceedingly impecunious household into lifelong independence and comfort; and she nursed, in what was for
            him luxury, the extreme old age of a father whose ideal and unworldly nature had made it very hard for him
            to afford ordinary comforts and advantages to her youth. This she did without tricks or meanness or
            self-puffing; without feeling jealousy, or inspiring antagonism. She had the delight of sending sunshine
            into a myriad of scattered homes, and of teaching many young girls, doubtless, the way to a more generous
            and noble life.</p>

        <p>The story of Louisa Alcott&rsquo;s life has been, to a certain extent, told by herself in &ldquo;Little
            Women.&rdquo; At least, the character of Jo was drawn from her own experiences and full of her own
            individuality, but hers throughout was a more notable history than the world knew. A girl, whose earliest
            teacher was Margaret Fuller; who, at ten years of age, learned to know the seasons in their varied dress and
            nature in its deepest meanings under Thoreau&rsquo;s guidance; to whom, men like Emerson, Channing, Ripley,
            and Hawthorne were every-day company, yet who was brought up almost in poverty, and with the necessity of
            work at home if not abroad; who had a fund of downright common sense and keen humor underlying all
            transcendental influence, &mdash;is one who, as a woman, might be expected to have made her mark, and she
            did it by the simplest, kindliest, cheeriest of writing, and the sweetest of companionship and kindness
            toward others.</p>
